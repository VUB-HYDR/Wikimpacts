      "Cyclone Vayu": " Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Vayu (/\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0ju\u02d0/) was a strong tropical cyclone that caused moderate damage in India during June 2019. It was the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the Saurashtra Peninsula of northwestern India since the 1998 Gujarat cyclone.[1][2] Vayu was the third tropical depression, third cyclonic storm and second very severe cyclonic storm of the 2019 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, and the first of which to form in the Arabian Sea. Vayu originated from a low-pressure area that was first noted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on 9\u00a0June, near the northern Maldives. After consolidating into a depression, the storm tracked slowly north-northwestward over the eastern Arabian Sea, and reached cyclonic storm intensity late on 10\u00a0June. Steady strengthening continued into 11\u00a0June, and the storm underwent rapid intensification late in the day. Vayu reached peak intensity as a high-end very severe cyclonic storm at 06:00\u00a0UTC on 12\u00a0June, with three-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0hPa (28.64\u00a0inHg).[3] Despite initially being forecast to make landfall in the state of Gujarat, Vayu turned abruptly to the west on 13\u00a0June and moved away from the coast. The system weakened gradually as it tracked slowly towards the Arabian Peninsula, then weakened more quickly after beginning to accelerate back towards India on 16 June. Vayu was downgraded to a deep depression the following morning, and further to a depression a few hours later. The system degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure area late on 17\u00a0June, just before crossing the Gujarat coast. Vayu's remnants continued inland for several more hours, before dissipating on 18\u00a0June. In total, as many as 6.6\u00a0million people in northwestern India were impacted by the cyclone.[4] Approximately 300,000 residents of coastal Gujarat were evacuated on 12\u00a0June in preparation for the system's arrival,[1] and thousands of personnel were deployed to the region to assist with preparations, rescue operations and clean up efforts. As of 18\u00a0June, eight people are reported to have been killed either directly or indirectly by the cyclone, and at least 12 more injured.[5][6][7][8][9] The name Vayu was provided by India, and is derived from a Sanskrit and Hindi word meaning 'wind'.[10]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In early June, a strong pulse of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO) tracked eastwards into the tropical Indian Ocean, leading to increased cloudiness and rainfall across the region.[11] The presence of the pulse also contributed to enhanced convective activity, and generated conditions which were supportive of tropical cyclogenesis.[12] On 9\u00a0June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) noted the development of a low-pressure area over the southeastern Arabian Sea, to the north of the Maldives.[13] Organisation increased throughout the day, and owing to the improved structure of the system, the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 22:30\u00a0UTC.[14] At 00:00\u00a0UTC the following day, the IMD indicated that the low-pressure area had consolidated into a tropical depression, and assigned it the designation ARB\u00a001.[15] Conditions were favourable for further intensification, with improving upper-level divergence, and ample energy being provided by extremely warm sea surface temperatures of 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F).[14][16] Vertical wind shear also continued to decrease as the depression tracked steadily north-northwestwards parallel to the western coast of India under the influence of an anticyclone over central India.[17] Deep convection strengthened around the low-level circulation centre, and the system was upgraded to a deep depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[18] Six hours later, the JTWC assessed one-minute sustained winds as having reached 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), and designated the system as Tropical Cyclone\u00a002A.[19] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on 10\u00a0June, the system strengthened into the third cyclonic storm of the season, and was named Vayu by the IMD.[20] Vayu continued to steadily strengthen after intensifying into a cyclonic storm. A formative eye began to develop on 11\u00a0June, as intense deep convection wrapped tightly around the system. Vayu became a severe cyclonic storm by 12:00\u00a0UTC, and reached Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).[21] Shortly afterwards, the cyclone began a period of rapid intensification; however, the rate of intensification was tempered somewhat by strong vertical wind shear. Vayu was upgraded to a very severe cyclonic storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC, and continued to strengthen through 00:00\u00a0UTC on 12\u00a0June, at which point the system became a Category\u00a02-equivalent tropical cyclone on the SSHWS.[22] One-minute sustained winds increased to 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) six hours later as a ragged eye developed on visible-light satellite imagery, surrounded by strong deep convection, particularly in the western semicircle of the storm.[23] The intensification trend then slowed, however, with three-minute sustained winds only increasing further to 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) by 12:00\u00a0UTC.[24] Vayu's intensity soon plateaued as ocean heat content began to decrease and drier air began to infiltrate the cyclone's circulation.[25][26] As Vayu approached the coastline of the state of Gujarat in northwestern India, the influence of a strengthening subtropical ridge over Saudi Arabia caused the system to gradually slow down and turn towards the west.[27][28] At 12:00 UTC on 13 June, the JTWC indicated that lower vertical wind shear had allowed Vayu to strengthen, noting that the eye had become more distinct. Vayu's intensity was now equivalent to a minimal Category 3 major hurricane on the SSHWS, with one-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[29] Vayu began to weaken on 14 June as it tracked slowly westward, away from the Gujarat coastline.[30] Despite the low wind shear and warm ocean, upper-level outflow from the storm had begun to diminish, allowing the dry air entrainment from the northwest to start eroding the cyclone.[31] The central dense overcast and circulation centre became increasingly ragged and elongated as deep convection diminished and started to become displaced. Vayu weakened to Category 1-equivalent tropical cyclone status at 12:00 UTC,[32] as the loose central convection expanded to leave a ragged eye 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) in diameter.[33] Vayu's slow westward track through the weak competing steering environment over the northern Arabian Sea brought the system into an environment of high easterly vertical wind shear.[34] The majority of deep convection became confined to the cyclone's southern quadrants,[34] causing the system to weaken to a severe cyclonic storm at 00:00 UTC on 16 June.[35] An approaching mid-latitude trough weakened the areas of high pressure centred to the west and northeast,[31] Vayu recurved sharply to the northeast.[36] Upon weakening further to a cyclonic storm, strong low-level southwesterly flow caused the system to accelerate northeastwards through the break in the blocking high-pressure ridge, back towards the Gujarat coast.[31][37] Strong vertical wind shear and dry air ingestion from the western semicircle of the storm's circulation continued to erode the cyclone, and Vayu weakened into a deep depression at 03:00 UTC on 17 June,[38] with the JTWC issuing their final advisory at this time.[39] The system was downgraded further to a depression by the IMD six hours later.[40] Soon afterwards, the IMD issued their final advisory on the system after Vayu degenerated into a well-marked low-pressure area, just before crossing the Gujarat coast near the India\u2013Pakistan border.[41] On 18 June, Vayu's remnants slowly moved inland, while continuing to weaken, before dissipating later that day.[citation needed]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "First approach to land[edit]": "As the system intensified into a deep depression, the IMD issued a pre-cyclone watch for the coastline of the state of Gujarat. The agency indicated that further strengthening into a cyclonic storm within the following 24\u00a0hours was very likely. Fishermen were warned not to venture into the Arabian Sea near the developing system or in the forecast path of the cyclone, and mariners already at sea were urged to return to the coast.[42] The pre-watch for the Gujarat coastline was upgraded to a yellow cyclone alert at 12:00\u00a0UTC on 10\u00a0June, with forecasts predicting landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm on 12\u00a0June.[17] This was further upgraded to an orange  alert on 11\u00a0June.[43] The IMD warned that thatched houses in the path of the cyclone were likely to be completely destroyed, and that kutcha houses could sustain significant damage. The IMD also indicated that a storm surge of 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0m (4.9\u20136.6\u00a0ft) was possible, and had the potential to inundate low-lying coastal areas.[44] Tropical cyclones are relatively infrequent in northwestern India and the northern Arabian Sea. Gujarat had not experienced a hurricane-force tropical cyclone landfall since an unnamed system struck the region as an extremely severe cyclonic storm in June 1998, causing more than 10,000 fatalities.[1] As Vayu was initially forecast to make landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm, the potential for major impacts prompted significant preparation measures in the state. Beginning on the morning of 12\u00a0June, the Indian government evacuated approximately 300,000 people living in coastal regions of Gujarat to 2000 shelter homes,[1][45][46] as well as 10,000 people from the nearby island of Diu.[47] All schools and colleges in the area were also closed to safeguard students and staff.[1] All flights at airports in Porbandar, Diu, Bhavnagar, Keshod and Kandla were grounded from midnight local time on 13\u00a0June, and 77 train services cancelled and 38 others shortened.[48] In Mumbai, ferry services were suspended,[2] more than 128 train services were cancelled or shortened,[9] and approximately 400 flights were affected by delays or diversions as the cyclone passed to the west on 12\u201313\u00a0June.[10] All ports in Gujarat suspended operations from 12\u00a0June, and many vessels which had been berthed there departed the ports for safety.[10][49] Approximately 2,300 personnel in 52 teams from the National Disaster Response Force were deployed to Gujarat help local authorities with evacuation efforts, as well as to aid in search, rescue and relief operations after the cyclone.[1][10] Personnel from the state reserve police were deployed to the region, as well as 300 commandos from the state marine police. Boats and aircraft were sent to various locations across Gujarat to enable and assist search and rescue operations if required.[50] The Indian Coast Guard, Army, Navy and Air Force were also all put on alert, with about 2,400 army personnel in 34 teams placed on standby, and naval diving teams assembled to conduct water rescues if necessary.[1][10][50][51] Police officers also conducted night patrols to ensure that no residents were left behind in evacuated areas.[50]",
      "Second approach to land[edit]": "After local governments were informed that Cyclone Vayu was likely to return to the coast of Gujarat, further preparations were undertaken, albeit minor due to the significantly weakened nature of the system. The IMD warned that heavy rainfall and large waves were expected, and had the potential to inundate low-lying areas such as the coastal salt marshes. As a precaution, the local government in the Kutch district of northern Gujarat asked salt pan workers in coastal areas from Bhachau to Mundra to stay home from work. The government noted that five teams from the NDRF that had been deployed in the initial large-scale preparatory measures would remain in Kutch for the anticipated landfall, and that several teams of local officers had been formed to help maintain safety and security throughout the event. Plans were made to evacuate local residents at short notice if required.[52]",
      "Impacts[edit]": "Despite not making landfall, Cyclone Vayu tracked close enough to the Indian coastline to produce minor impacts. Strong winds, heavy rainfall and large waves were experienced along large sections of the country's western coast, particularly in Gujarat.[53] Numerous thatched houses were either damaged or destroyed by gusty winds, with many kutcha houses having their roofs torn off.[6] A large number of tin sheds were blown away, and many trees were uprooted along the Saurashtra coast and on the island of Diu.[50][54] Strong winds caused the 150-year-old Bhuteshwar Mahadev temple in Porbandar to collapse and a metal shed at Somnath Temple to be damaged.[50][55][48] Damage to power lines and electricity poles caused power cuts in more than 2,250 villages in Gujarat, with blackouts lasting for several days in some locations.[56][57] The prolonged strong winds generated waves of around 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) high along large parts of the coastline.[48] Many low-lying coastal areas on the Saurashtra coast and southern Gujarat were flooded by waves and tides of up to 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) in height,[54] and severe damage was caused to at least 15 houses in the city of Ullal.[58] Local fishermen in Porbandar sustained \u20b910 million (US$140,000) in damages as strong winds and waves caused as many as 25 small boats to sink, and one larger boat to receive significant damage. In Veraval, about 20 small boats and five larger boats were also damaged.[57] Fishermen complained that there had been inadequate room to safely anchor their vessels during the cyclone, which was responsible for the damage.[59] Some fishermen in Veraval also had to be rescued after their boats capsized in the large waves, with one person being hospitalised due to their injuries.[8][60] Moderate to heavy rainfall occurred in more than 100 tehsils across Gujarat. The highest observed rainfall total was at Talala in the Gir-Somnath district, where 160 millimetres (6.3\u00a0in) of precipitation was recorded.[61] Veraval also experienced heavy rainfall, with 67 millimetres (2.6\u00a0in) falling in just six hours.[62] In southern Gujarat, lightning strikes killed five people and injured two others. Many of the victims had been working on farms during heavy rain and thunderstorms when they were struck.[6][8] A motorist was also killed after being hit by a falling tree on the side of the road while driving home.[6] In the town of Chamba in northern India, houses and roads were damaged by flash flooding and hail from a severe thunderstorm associated with Vayu.[50] Rainfall associated with Vayu continued for several days in the state of Maharashtra, with the city of Nashik receiving 92.1 millimetre (0.039\u00a0in) of precipitation in a 24-hour period on 15\u201316 June.[63] Cyclone Vayu also caused impacts in other parts of India. Mumbai experienced strong sustained winds which peaked just below gale-force at 58\u00a0km/h (36\u00a0mph) after midday on 12 June. Several trees fell throughout the city, resulting in at least four injuries, and blocking a road for many hours.[9] A pedestrian was killed and two others were injured when an aluminium cladding sheet fell from Churchgate railway station. The family of the deceased victim received \u20b9500,000 (US$7,000) as an ex gratia payment from the railway company.[64] Three pedestrians were injured by an acrylic sheet that had fallen from a skywalk due to strong winds.[5] A hoarding also collapsed near a train station in Thane, although no injuries were reported.[9] Strong winds also produced a large dust storm in the Indian capital, New Delhi, on 12 June.[65] Crude oil and plastic waste were washed up onto beaches on the Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg coasts by waves generated by Vayu.[66][67] Enhanced waves and ocean swell generated by Cyclone Vayu while it was located in the northern Arabian Sea also affected some coastal areas of Oman, including the South Al Sharqiyah governorate. The waves caused minor flooding of low-lying areas in various towns along the coast, including Al Suwaih and Ras Al Hid. Seawater caused some houses to become flooded, as well as local beaches and surrounding areas. Floodwaters also caused several vehicles to drift from where they were parked.[68] Large waves also caused minor flooding in about ten villages in coastal regions of southern Pakistan.[69] The onset of the Indian monsoon had been delayed past its usual commencement by about one week due to near-El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean throughout 2019.[70][71] The formation of Cyclone Vayu caused a further week's delay in the monsoon's progression towards northern India by drawing clouds and moisture over the Arabian Sea, away from the developing monsoon trough.[45][72] The severe heat wave in Pakistan was also exacerbated by Vayu. The anticlockwise rotation of the cyclone's wind field caused typical cool onshore winds to be replaced by hot winds from the desert to the north.[73] Temperatures of above 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) were experienced in numerous cities across the country, including the coastal city of Karachi.[73][74] One elderly resident in Karachi died of heat stroke on 15 June, and numerous other people were treated in hospitals and medical clinics for symptoms such as dehydration, dizziness and exhaustion.[7]",

      "Typhoon Kyle (1993)": "Typhoon Kyle, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Luring, was the first of five deadly tropical cyclones that affected and impacted the Philippines and Vietnam during the 1993 Pacific typhoon season. The twenty-seventh named storm and thirteenth typhoon of the season, Kyle formed from a monsoon depression near Palau, associated with bursts of scattered convection. It then drifted west-northwest, strengthening to a tropical storm the next day. Land interaction prevented further intensification, and it crossed through the central Philippines while maintaining its intensity on November 20. Upon entering the South China Sea, the system strengthened to a severe tropical storm before rapidly intensifying to a typhoon, three days later. It soon reached its peak intensity that day, with one-minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category 2 typhoon. It held its strength until landfall in Vietnam later that evening. Weakening through the mountainous terrain of the country, it dissipated near the Cambodia\u2013Thailand border on November 24. The typhoon caused over 106 confirmed deaths, mainly are from Vietnam. Landslides and large swaths of flash floods are also seen and reported, as far as Thailand. The typhoon, overall, caused over $1.5 million (1993 USD) in total, mainly are from washed-out crops and farmlands in the country. The Philippines also reported some power outages, flooding and a fatality, but due to the sparse coverage from the typhoon, the total damages and overall deaths were unknown.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "At 12:00 UTC on November 17, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a monsoon depression associated with a weak area of convection near Yap State.[1] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) of Japan also started to mention the disturbance in their bulletins at that time.[2] The disturbance had blossoming convection around its disorganized low-level circulation center at that time.[2] It slowly moved to the west-northwest while slowly organizing, behind a favorable environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.[3] Around 06:00 UTC of November 19, the JTWC started to mention the developing system in their Significant Tropical Weather Advisories, as the disturbance became well-defined in satellite imagery.[1] Roughly six hours later, the agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression without issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert due to the system quickly developing.[1] At 18:00 UTC that day, the system attained a tight convective curvature, leading the JTWC to upgrade the system to a tropical storm and named it Kyle.[1] The JMA also issued their first advisory on Kyle as a tropical storm at the same time.[2] The system became slightly disorganized as it started to approach the Philippines due to wind shear, but still continued to organize despite the environment.[2] Early the next day, it passed to the south of Homonhon Island while traversing Leyte Gulf before making landfall on Abuyog, Leyte between 03:00 and 06:00 UTC as a minimal storm, with 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) winds.[2][3] It then traversed the province before moving through Ormoc Bay, just before another landfall between 09:00 and 10:00 UTC on Merida, Leyte.[2] There, Kyle became highly disorganized while moving through the Visayas, although it remained a tropical storm.[2] The storm then crossed the coast near Bagay before arriving again in the Visayan Sea.[2] Landfall took place again on 18:00 UTC on Batad, Iloilo before crossing out on Sulu Sea, where it slightly strengthened.[2] It then passed between Busuanga and Culion Island in Palawan on 09:00 UTC of the next day, before heading out to the South China Sea.[2] As Kyle moved again to a favorable environment, the system strengthened to a severe tropical storm before intensifying to a minimal typhoon, while located approximately 300\u00a0km, north-northwest of Nansha District.[3] A small and elongated eye also emerged at this time.[1] Early the next day, Kyle further strengthened to a mid-level typhoon and reached its peak intensity of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 960 mbar, while approaching the coast of Vietnam on November 23.[3][1] It held this intensity until it slightly weakened before its final landfall on the country, 380\u00a0km to the northeast of Ho Chi Minh City on the evening of the same day.[3][2] It rapidly weakened as it traversed Vietnam before entering the nearby Cambodia as a tropical depression.[2] The last warning was issued by the JMA and JTWC as Kyle dissipated near the Cambodia-Thailand border on November 24.[3][2][1]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "Hundreds of individuals in Visayas were forced to flee due to Tropical Storm Kyle.[4] The storm, despite weak, spawned numerous flash floods and landslides that flooded homes in Leyte, Samar and Cebu.[5] A fatality was reported in an unknown place when a 10-year old kid were electrocuted by a live wire.[5] There were also reported crop and farmland damages to the central part of the country.[6] In total, Kyle caused only minor damages, though the total damages and overall deaths were unknown due to sparse coverages.[7]",
      "Vietnam[edit]": "The Central Committee for Flood and Storm Control (CCFSC) issued typhoon watches and warnings to the coastal portions of the country and some residents were evacuated to safe places.[8] Officials in Vietnam reported 106 deaths, 59 missing, and 476 injuries due to the typhoon.[9][1][10] Torrential downpour and strong winds destroyed 5,601 houses and submerged over 11,217 more.[8] Some schools also collapsed and bridges were washed out due to strong currents from overflowed rivers.[8] Over 17,212 hectares of farmlands were also destroyed and hundreds of fishing boats sustained damages.[8][3] The total damages from Kyle in the country were estimated at $1.5 million (1993 USD).[1]",
      "Thailand[edit]": "The remnants of the storm also caused floods in Thailand.[9] Some authorities in Nakhon Si Thammarat reported three fatalities, all due to unknown reasons.[9]",

      "Typhoon Morakot": "Typhoon Morakot, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Kiko, was the deadliest typhoon to impact Taiwan in recorded history. The eighth named storm and fourth typhoon of the 2009 Pacific typhoon season, Morakot wrought catastrophic damage in Taiwan, killing 673 people and leaving 26 people missing, and causing roughly NT$110 billion (US$3.3\u00a0billion) in damages. Morakot originated as a tropical depression in the West Pacific on August 2. The system initially moved northeastward, before taking a westward track, developing into a tropical storm on August 3, with the JMA giving it the name Morakot. The storm gradually strengthened as it moved towards Taiwan, intensifying into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon on August 5. Morakot reached its peak intensity on August 7, with a minimum central pressure of 945 millibars (27.9\u00a0inHg), maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), and maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Afterward, Morakot's forward motion slowed and the system gradually weakened, making landfall on central Taiwan later that day as a severe tropical storm. Over the next day, Morakot slowly meandered over Taiwan, before emerging into the Taiwan Strait and turning northward, making landfall on Mainland China on August 9. Afterward, Morakot accelerated northward while gradually weakening, before later turning northeastward. On August 11, Morakot degenerated into a remnant low in the East China Sea, before dissipating on August 13, over northern Japan. The storm produced copious amounts of rainfall, peaking at 2,777\u00a0mm (109.3\u00a0in), far surpassing the previous record of 1,736\u00a0mm (68.35\u00a0in) set by Typhoon Herb in 1996. The extreme amount of rain triggered enormous mudflows and severe flooding throughout southern Taiwan. One landslide (and subsequent flood) destroyed the entire town of Siaolin, killing over 400 people. The slow-moving storm also caused widespread damage in China, leaving eight people dead and causing $1.4\u00a0billion (2009 USD) in damages. Nearly 2,000 homes were destroyed in the country and 136,000 more were reported to have sustained damage. In the wake of the storm, Taiwan's government faced extreme criticism for the slow response to the disaster and for initially deploying only roughly 2,100 soldiers to the affected regions. Later, the number of soldiers working to recover trapped residents increased to 46,000. Rescue crews were able to retrieve thousands of trapped residents from buried villages and isolated towns across the island. Days later, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou apologized for the government's slow response publicly. On August\u00a019, the Taiwan government announced that they would start a NT$100\u00a0billion (US$3\u00a0billion) reconstruction plan that would take place over a three-year span in the devastated regions of southern Taiwan.[1] Days after the storm, international aid began to be sent to the island. The storm also caused severe flooding in the northern Philippines that killed 26 people due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Early on August 2, 2009, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a tropical depression had formed within a monsoon trough located about 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) east of Luzon,[2][3] However the depression remained weak and was downgraded to an area of low pressure, before regenerating later that day.[4][5][6] Both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) then started to monitor the depression early the next day, while it was located about 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Okinawa, Japan, with the PAGASA assigning the name Kiko to the depression.[3][7] The JTWC reported at this time that the storm consisted of an area of convection, with deep convection flaring on the western side of a partially exposed low-level circulation center.[3] Later on August 3, the JMA reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, and gave it the name  Morakot. The JTWC further designated the system as Tropical Depression 09W, as deep convection had increased over the low-level circulation center, and the agency reported that the storm was moving around a low-level ridge of high pressure, which was located to the east of the Morakot's low-level circulation center. On the morning of August 4, the JTWC reported that the Morakot had steadily intensified into a tropical storm, as 1-minute sustained wind speeds were estimated to be near 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), with deep convective banding building toward the low-level circulation center, under the influence of a subtropical ridge located to the east of the system. Later that day, the JMA reported that Morakot had intensified into a severe tropical storm, before it was upgraded to a typhoon by both the JMA and the JTWC early the next day. Initially, the JTWC anticipated that Morakot would intensify into a powerful typhoon while approaching China, peaking as a Category\u00a04-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHWS). However, due to the size of the typhoon, while the barometric pressure steadily decreased, the maximum winds only increased slightly. Early on August\u00a07, the storm attained its peak intensity, with a central minimum pressure of 945 millibars (27.9\u00a0inHg) and maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), according to the JMA. The JTWC reported the storm to be slightly stronger, with maximum 1-minute winds peaking at 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. Morakot's forward motion slowed, and the storm weakened slightly before making landfall in central Taiwan later that day, as a severe tropical storm. Roughly 24\u00a0hours later, the storm emerged back over water into the Taiwan Strait and turned northward, before making landfall in Mainland China on August\u00a09, as a severe tropical storm. The storm gradually weakened as it continued to slowly track inland, with the storm's forward motion gradually increasing, with the system eventually turning northeastward on August\u00a011. Later that day, Morakot degenerated into a remnant low in the East China Sea, before making landfall on South Korea early on the next day, and then making another landfall on northern Japan on August\u00a013. The remnants of the typhoon dissipated shortly afterward.",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Japan[edit]": "On Thursday August 6, shortly after midday, Morakot lashed Okinawa-Honto with wind gusts as high as 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h),[19] stranding thousands of summer holiday air travelers. Naha Airport experienced east crosswinds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) which almost completely shut down the airport. Domestic and international airlines reported 252 flights canceled, stranding 41,648 passengers at the peak of the summer Obon holidays. Some Kadena-based U.S. aircraft were evacuated ahead of Morakot.[19] The southernmost island groups of Yaeyama, including Yonaguni and Ishigaki, were affected by gale- or storm-force winds.",
      "Philippines[edit]": "The World Vision organization reported that they distributed roughly 40 gallons of water to 800 people. The National Disaster Coordinating Council declared a state of calamity for the Zambales region, as over 13,000 people were left homeless.[106]",
      "Taiwan[edit]": "After the typhoon, search-and-rescue teams were eventually deployed throughout Taiwan in response to numerous landslides and flash flooding. Helicopters were rushed to Siaolin to retrieve as many residents as possible and transport them to shelters. By August\u00a011, nearly 300 residents were confirmed to have been moved to safety. During the afternoon, one helicopter crashed into a mountainside while carrying three crew members. All three crew members died. Continuing standards set up after the 1999 Jiji earthquake, the Government of Taiwan provided NT$1\u00a0million for each family member killed or missing and NT$250,000 for the critically injured.[82] The military was dispatched with responding to the disasters all around the country with transporting food and aid around.[83] After the typhoon, soldiers were also used in cleanup and rebuilding.[84] An estimated 15,815 soldiers were used in total. With the assistance of firefighters and policemen, an estimated 41,752 people were rescued.[85] Due to the severity of the damage in Siaolin access to the area was restricted to military personnel only.[86] Major-General Richard Hu said it is still too early to state how many villagers had been buried, military rescuers just know that 90% of the homes of the three villages were buried by the landslide.[87]\n[88] On August 15, the Executive Yuan formed the \"Typhoon Morakot Rebuilding Committee\". The 37 person committee was given a budget of $116.5 million NTD to rebuild infrastructure and economic losses. The committee has built 3,481 permanent housing units in 40 locations and repaired most damaged roads.[89] However, there was controversy surrounding the relocation of people to these new housing units.[90] The Executive Yuan announced that all flags be placed at half-mast in mourning between August 22 and 24.[91] After the flooding, many organizations began raising money for rebuilding in areas affected by the typhoon. Special programs were aired on national TV to fundraise. Additionally, a fundraising festival named \"Spread the Love\" was held, featuring prominent TV personalities Matilda Tao, Chang Hsiao-yen, and Shen Chun-hua. The event lasted for 7 hours and was aired on national TV and raised $500 million NTD. Many large corporations also donated money to the cause, including Chi Mei, Evergreen, Delta Electronics, Foxconn, Formosa Plastics, TSMC, Cathay United Bank, and Asus. The Chunghua Post released a special edition stamp, with all proceeds going to helping rebuild. President Ma Ying-jeou and his administration have been criticised because of the slow response to Typhoon Morakot. The government was initially found to have rejected foreign aid, then to have quickly reversed that decision in response to criticism, citing that the rejection was only temporary. Vice Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia has tendered his resignation for authorizing Taiwan's diplomats to turn down foreign aid, a decision done without the consent of more senior officials.[92][93][94] Immediately after the typhoon, large civilian and military search-and-rescue operations were deployed.  Helicopters were sent to numerous mountain villages, including Siaolin, in an attempt to rescue locals who were unable to escape by foot.[citation needed] It was discovered that almost 400 people had vanished, and are presumed to have been buried alive when a massive mudflow wiped out 90 per cent of the village's homes.[citation needed]  Similar stories have been reported from other small villages in the vicinity of this region.[citation needed] The record-breaking rains also caused catastrophic agricultural losses, with estimates reaching NT$14.59 billion (US$443 million).[95] Fund raising shows such as Artistes 88 Fund Raising Campaign were held in Taiwan and Hong Kong.[96] Taiwanese aborigines protested against the 14th Dalai Lama during his visit to Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot and denounced it as politically motivated.[97][98][99][100] The government relocated several Rukai villages following the damage to southern Taiwan.[101]:\u200a123\u200a This mandated move threatened Rukai culture and prompted Rukai groups to begin community-based conservation programs to help local Rukai communities assert sovereignty over traditional lands.[101]:\u200a123 The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits donated a total of $450 million Renminbi ($2 billion RMB) to rebuild. They specified that $150 million TWD be used on building 500 units of recovery housing and $1.7 billion TWD be used on rebuilding infrastructure.[102] The Mainland Affairs Council estimated that around $4 billion NTD was donated by China. Also, around $130 million NTD was donated by Taiwanese companies in China.[103][104][105] The Xiaolin Village Memorial Park was opened in January 2012 to commemorate the village victims from the typhoon.",
      "China[edit]": "During a four-day span, Morakot produced up to 1,240\u00a0mm (49\u00a0in) of rain in Zhejiang province, the highest total in nearly 60 years in the province. A landslide in Pengxi, at the foot of a mountain, destroyed a three-story apartment building, with six people inside. All six were recovered from the rubble of the structure. However, two later died of their injuries.[17] In Wenzhou, a large landslide destroyed six apartment buildings, burying an unknown number of people, some of whom were feared dead.[70] One person was killed after torrential rains caused the house he was in to collapse, as well as four other nearby homes.[71] In Xiapu county, the location of Morakot's landfall in China, 136,000 people reported damage to their homes from flooding or landslides. The fishing sector of the local industry sustained roughly 200\u00a0million yuan (US$29\u00a0million) in losses. Fourteen townships in the county were flooded. An estimated 3.4\u00a0million people reported property damage throughout Zhejiang province, with at least 1,600 homes being destroyed.[71] At least 10,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by the storm and over 1\u00a0million acres (4,000\u00a0km2) of farmland was inundated by flooding. In China, damages from the storm amounted to $1.4\u00a0billion.[17] Over 11\u00a0million people were affected by Typhoon Morakot throughout eastern China.[72]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Nantou County[edit]": "The most damage done to Nantou County was in Xinyi, which had the greatest rainfall in the county.[53] The currents of the Chenyoulan River caused the foundations of roads and buildings to be wiped away.[54] A building in Longhua Elementary School tilted 30 degrees as a result of the foundations being washed away and was on the verge of falling into the river.[55] Provincial Highway 16 collapsed between Jiji and Shuili, causing seven cars to be washed into the Zhuoshui River. So far, only four out of fifteen bodies have been recovered.[56]",
      "Kaohsiung County[edit]": "Kaohsiung County saw over 2,500 millimeters of rainfall within three days (Kaohsiung typically receives the same amount of rain in a year). The rain brought severe floods on the plains and landslides in the mountains. On August 14, Xiaolin Village was completely covered due to a landslide, causing the deaths of 398 people. Due to the rain, many bridges were washed away, including those on Provincial Highways 20, 21, and 27 and the bridge to the Maolin National Scenic Area. 14 people went missing after a weir under construction was washed away.[57]",
      "Pingtung County[edit]": "Pingtung County is one of the areas hardest hit by the typhoon. Due to the collapse of embankment along the Linbian River, there was severe flooding in Linbian and Jiadong, with Jiadong reporting flood depths of two stories. Embankments along the Laonong River also collapsed, causing flooding in Gaoshu. A bridge on Provincial Highway 24 collapsed, effectively cutting off Wutai Township from the rest of the country. According to the Water Resources Agency, the area with the highest rainfall was in Wanluan Township with 135 millimeters per hour. The total highest rainfall was recorded in Sandimen Township with over 2500 millimeters.[58] The railways in Pingtung also took a huge hit, with the Pingtung Line taking 6 months to repair.[59] Linbian Train Station's train tracks were entirely covered in mud after severe flooding there.[60]",
      "Taitung County[edit]": "Most of the flooding in Taitung County occurred in the south part of the county, with Daren, Taimali, and Dawu Townships being especially hard hit. Flooding was especially serious in Zhiben Hot Springs, with 200 meters of its main road washed away. On August 9, the Jinshuai Hotel's (\u91d1\u5e25\u6eab\u6cc9\u5927\u98ef\u5e97) foundations were washed away, and the eight-story hotel toppled over into the Zhiben River. Soon afterward, the top three floors of the hotel were washed away.[61][62] The TRA South Link Line was also hard hit, with two of its bridges being washed away in Taimali Township.[63] The Taimali River also flooded, destroying a large portion of Taihe Village in Taimali.[64][65]",
      "Other counties[edit]": "In Chiayi County, embankments along the Bazhang and Puzi rivers collapsed, causing flooding in Puzi Township.[66] Since the coastal areas are lower in elevation, there was also widespread flooding in Dongshi, Budai, and Yizhu.[67] Many villages in Alishan, Meishan, Zhuqi townships saw flooding and destruction done to their infrastructure. The Alishan Forest Railway saw some serious damage, and repairs took about a year.[68][69] Central and North Taiwan saw some less severe flooding, with the most serious in Dacheng and Erlin in Changhua County.",
      "Oil deliveries[edit]": "The typhoon has resulted in some identifiable but limited impact on oil deliveries to East Asian destinations. At least two fuel oil cargoes in East China were delayed due to Typhoon Morakot. This included 90,000-mt Venezuelan fuel oil cargo with Zhoushan in Zhejiang Province. There was a report that an 18,000-mt cargo of Singapore-origin with fuel oil on board for an August 10 delivery into Zhangjiagang in Jiangsu Province was postponed to August 15. Many ports in East China were closed from August 8, including Waigaoqiao, Jinshan and Yangshan ports in Shanghai, Zhoushan and Ningbo ports in Zhejiang, Zhangjiagang, Nantong and Jiangyin ports in Jiangsu.",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "",
      "Retirement[edit]": "Due to the extensive damage and deaths caused by the storm, the name Morakot was later retired. The committee selected the name Atsani to replace \"Morakot\" on the Western Pacific basin name lists beginning in 2011, and was first used in the 2015 season.",

      "Hurricane Irma": "  Effects Other wikis Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful Cape Verde hurricane that caused widespread destruction across its path in early September 2017. Irma was the first Category\u00a05 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands on record, followed by Maria two weeks later. At the time, it was considered the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, until it was surpassed by Hurricane Dorian two years later. It was also the third-strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane and Dorian.[1] The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, second major hurricane,[nb 1] and first Category\u00a05 hurricane of the extremely active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime, particularly in the northeastern Caribbean and the Florida Keys. It was also the most intense hurricane  to strike the continental United States since Katrina in 2005, the first major hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma in the same year, and the first Category\u00a04 hurricane to strike the state since Charley in 2004. The word Irmageddon was coined soon after the hurricane to describe the damage caused by the hurricane.[3] Irma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August\u00a030. Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale by late on August\u00a031. The storm's intensity fluctuated between Categories\u00a02 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles. On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category\u00a05 hurricane by early on the next day. Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 914\u00a0hPa (27.0\u00a0inHg). Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed. Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category\u00a04 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category\u00a05 status before making landfall in Cuba. Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category\u00a02 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category\u00a04 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September\u00a010. Irma then weakened to Category\u00a03 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day. The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama and ultimately dissipated on September\u00a013 over Missouri. The storm caused catastrophic damage in Barbuda, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, Anguilla, and the Virgin Islands as a Category\u00a05 hurricane. The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in Anguilla; one in Barbados; three in Barbuda; four in the British Virgin Islands; 10 in Cuba; 11 in the French West Indies; one in Haiti; three in Puerto Rico; four on the Dutch side of Sint Maarten; 92 in the contiguous United States, and four in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Hurricane Irma was the top Google searched term in the U.S. and globally in 2017.[4]",
      "Meteorological history": "The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26.[5] The tropical wave moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27. Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29.[6] Around 00:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, the system developed into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Irma, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates. With warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, strengthening was anticipated, with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier air.[7] The nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images.[10] Early on August 31, shortly after the development of a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature,[11] Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane \u2013 around 00:00 UTC on September 1. Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane's intensity had increased by 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[7] On September 2, a ship passed 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h), which indicated that the eye of Irma remained compact.[12][13] A strong high pressure system to the north of Irma caused the storm to move west-southwestward between September 2 and September 4.[7] The first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from Barbados on the afternoon of September 3, discovering an eye 29\u00a0mi (47\u00a0km) in diameter and surface winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[14][15] On September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category\u00a04 hurricane. As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category\u00a05 hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC on the following day, with winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h). The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h) near 18:00\u00a0UTC on September 5. Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance.[16] Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands. Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at 914\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg) \u2013 this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180\u00a0mph (290\u00a0km/h). Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15\u00a0UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30\u00a0UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands, though the storm's central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.[7] As the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September\u00a06, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls. Late on September\u00a06, the cyclone passed about 60\u00a0mi (97\u00a0km) north of Puerto Rico. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September\u00a07. After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category\u00a04 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September\u00a08. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category\u00a05 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above 156\u00a0mph (251\u00a0km/h) \u2013 behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane. At 05:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas with sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h). The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category\u00a05 intensity at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day east of Cuba as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00\u00a0UTC on September 9, with winds of 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h). This made Irma only the second Category\u00a05 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category\u00a02 storm later on September 9.[7] After slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards Florida around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States. Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category\u00a04 hurricane at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.[7] In addition, Irma's wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) and gale-force winds spanning 220\u00a0mi (350\u00a0km) in diameter.[17] The cyclone made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, at 13:00\u00a0UTC on September 10, at Category\u00a04 intensity, with winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h). Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category\u00a03 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30\u00a0UTC, in Marco Island, Florida, with sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category\u00a03 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category\u00a01 hurricane around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation \u2013 though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds. The system finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00\u00a0UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia,[7] while acquiring some extratropical characteristics.[18] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had diminished. The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating over Missouri on September 13.[7]",
      "Preparations": "",
      "Caribbean": "Given that Irma's forecast track was along much of the Caribbean island chain, hurricane warnings were issued for the northern Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and parts of Hispaniola on September 5.[7] In Antigua and Barbuda, residents safeguarded their homes and cleaned up their properties in anticipation of strong winds. Emergency crews were put on standby at public shelters and hospitals by September 5 to assist with any evacuations.[19] Expecting a direct hit, more than half of the residents on Barbuda took shelter,[20] and relief supplies were preemptively mobilized.[21] The National Emergency Management Organization on Saint Lucia urged small craft operators and swimmers to be mindful of forecasts for high surf.[22] Small Craft Warnings and High Surf Advisories were hoisted for Dominica, where residents were urged to remain vigilant of the potential for high waves, landslides, and flooding.[23] In Guadeloupe, low-lying and cliff-edge homes were evacuated at the threat of flooding and erosion. Schools and public businesses closed on September 5 and 6. Hospitals stocked up on three days' worth of supplies and checked the functionality of their generators.[24][25] Of the island's 32 communes, 22 activated their emergency plans; 1,500 people were urged to take shelter.[26] The island sustained relatively minor damage and became the base for relief efforts on Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy.[27] Though the core of the hurricane was expected to remain north of the island, a yellow alert was issued for Martinique due to the likelihood of rough seas.[28] The island dispatched relief supplies and military reinforcements to its neighboring islands of Guadeloupe, Saint Martin. and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, which faced a greater risk of a direct impact.[29] On September 4, Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency.[30] By September 6, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency had deployed response teams in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Supplies, including food rations, medical supplies, and blankets, were pre-staged in strategic locations on the islands for distribution.[31] On September 5, the Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, thus providing for humanitarian satellite coverage;[32] the United States and Haiti followed suit two days later.[33][34] According to officials, 11,200 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas prior to the storm's arrival.[35] Approximately 7,400 tourists were moved to Santo Domingo, away from beach resorts.[36] In Haiti, government officials and aid organizations struggled with early preparation and evacuation efforts. While some officials blamed reluctance and indifference on the part of the population, others \"admitted they were not prepared for the onslaught and no mandatory evacuation orders were in place ahead of Irma's approach.\"[36][37] Local officials contended that they had not received promised funds, supplies, or equipment from the national government. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti prepared its 1,000 peacekeepers and engineers to assist.[38] In the Turks and Caicos, evacuation orders were issued for low-lying areas starting September 5. Schools were closed, government buildings were boarded up, and shelters were opened.[39] Officials spread warnings to residents in English, Creole, and Spanish via social media, radio, SMS text, and WhatsApp.[40] In The Bahamas, the government began preparations the week prior to the hurricane's arrival, including securing national sports facilities to use as shelters.[41] By September 7, the government had evacuated 1,609 people by air from the southern islands, including 365 from Bimini.[42] Controlled cutting of the power supply to southern and central Bahamian islands was conducted in advance of the storm.[43] Shelters were made available, though usage was low due to most evacuees staying with family on other islands.[44] Of the 2,679 foreign tourists still in The Bahamas on September 7, about 1,200 were being housed at Atlantis Paradise Island, one of the most hurricane-ready structures in the country.[45] In Cuba, meteorologists did not initially predict a direct hit.[46] Fuel conservation was enacted in Camag\u00fcey Province to ensure that enough would be available during post-storm power outages.[47] The Civil Defense evacuated nearly one million people from low-lying areas, including thousands of Canadian and European tourists in the Jardines del Rey.[48][46] Dolphins at a Cayo Guillermo resort were evacuated by helicopter.[46]",
      "Mainland United States": "Hurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida. Except for the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned. Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys. The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States. After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor Rick Scott said \"I thought we would see more damage\" [on the mainland] but said \"he witnessed devastation in the Keys\".[167] President Donald Trump commented on Twitter that the devastation in some places was \"far greater than anyone thought\".[168] Damage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50\u00a0billion. At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Harvey earlier that year, and Katrina in 2005. However, later in September\u00a02017, Hurricane Maria became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest. At least 92 people, 10\u00a0directly and 82\u00a0indirectly, died throughout the United States in relation to Irma: 84 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in South Carolina, and 2 in North Carolina.[7]",
      "Florida": "Sporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm.[252][253] On September\u00a011, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys. The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.[254] Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City.[255] USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery.[256] On September\u00a012, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada. Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key.[257] By late on September\u00a012, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West.[258] On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon.[259] Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City.[260] Due mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel.[261][262][263] In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11\u00a0AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108 (82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County (Florida Keys), 154 of 212 (73%) were non-functioning in Collier County (Naples), 36 of 46 (78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County (Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County.[264] NOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm. The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area. Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.[265] Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys.[266] In the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas.[267] Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane. A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant. One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters. Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure. Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.[268] Following Irma's passage, a 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old. The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.[269] Due to Irma's and Hurricane Harvey's impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010. The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September.[270]",
      "Elsewhere": "Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency initially for all six coastal counties on September 6, but eventually expanded the declaration to 94\u00a0counties south of Atlanta metropolitan area, and then the entire state on September\u00a010. Atlanta was placed under its first-ever tropical storm warning.[61][62] Governor Deal ordered mandatory evacuations for all areas east of Interstate 95 on September 7, before extending the order to the entirety of Chatham County and low-lying areas west of I-95 on the following day.[63] In total, 540,000 people on the Georgia coast were ordered to leave.[64] Contraflow lane reversal for Interstate 16 took effect on the morning of September 9 from Savannah to Dublin, Georgia.[65] All Georgia state parks were open for free to evacuees, as was the 800-acre camping area at Atlanta Motor Speedway.[66] Reversible HOT lanes on Interstate 75 in Georgia through south metro Atlanta were open 24 hours northbound with no tolls.[67] North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on September 6,[68] with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster following suit the same day.[69] Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on September 8 in order to protect Virginia residents and to mobilize resources in support of neighboring states.[70] Officials in New Orleans stated that there would not be much time for preparations if Irma failed to make the projected northward turn, but that South Texas or Florida would not be a good evacuation destination.[71]  On September 10, Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam issued an executive order allowing medical professionals in other states to practice in Tennessee to aid Hurricane Irma evacuees. This order also allowed pharmacies to give out 14-day supplies of medicine, and gave women and children from outside the state the ability to participate in the Tennessee Department of Health programs.[72] Bristol Motor Speedway,[73] Talladega Superspeedway,[66] and Charlotte Motor Speedway all opened their campgrounds to evacuees free of charge.[73]",
      "Sports": "In professional sports, the Miami Dolphins\u2013Tampa Bay Buccaneers game scheduled for September 10 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was postponed to November\u00a019 due to the storm's threat. The Dolphins left early for their road game against the Los Angeles Chargers.[74] The Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees moved their September 11\u201313 series from Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg to Citi Field in Queens.[74] Minor League Baseball's Florida State League, Carolina League, and Southern League called off their championship finals and as a result, named their division series winners league co-champions.[75][76][77] The Miami FC versus San Francisco Deltas match on September 10 was cancelled so the players and staff could prepare for the storm with their families.[78] The Orlando Pride of the National Women's Soccer League rescheduled their September 9 match to September 7.[79] Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer did not have any scheduled home games in September, but was unable to return to training facilities in Orlando due to Hurricane Irma.[80] In college football, the UCF Knights-Memphis Tigers game scheduled for September\u00a09 was moved to September 30, replacing UCF's game against Maine and Memphis game against Georgia State. UCF also cancelled their game against Georgia Tech on September\u00a016, as UCF's stadium hosted the National Guard.[81] The USF Bulls-Connecticut Huskies football game was also cancelled. The Miami Hurricanes\u2013Arkansas State Redwolves game scheduled for September 9 at Centennial Bank Stadium in Arkansas was canceled due to travel concerns for the University of Miami. The Florida Gators-Northern Colorado Bears match in Gainesville scheduled for September 9 was cancelled. The Florida State Seminoles contest against the Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks was canceled on September 8.[82] The Seminoles' rivalry game with the Hurricanes in Tallahassee, originally scheduled for September 16, was postponed tp October 7. The FIU Panthers game against the Alcorn State Braves was moved up a day and relocated to Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.[83] The Georgia Southern Eagles game against the New Hampshire Wildcats on September 9 was also moved to Legion Field for that day.[84]",
      "FEMA funding": "As of September 5, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding was running dangerously low, due to its response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas the previous week, prompting the Trump administration to request an immediate $8\u00a0billion in additional funding as Irma approached Florida.[85] Given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage, the United States Senate almost doubled the requested amount to $15.3\u00a0billion, with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to Harvey.[86]",
      "Impact": "Hurricane Irma's path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity. Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences. Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.[96]",
      "Antigua and Barbuda": "In response to Hurricane Jose's approach, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda issued a mandatory evacuation on September 9 for any remaining residents on Barbuda. A Miami cargo plane landed on Antigua later that day, carrying over 60 tons (120,000\u00a0lbs) of relief supplies for the displaced storm victims\u2014including bottled water, canned food and power generators.[218]",
      "Saint Martin": "On the morning of September 6, Irma's center crossed the island of Saint Martin while the storm was at peak intensity, sweeping away entire structures, submerging roads and cars, and triggering an island-wide blackout.[104] Irma's extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory. On the French side of Saint-Martin, entire marinas around Marigot were left in ruins, littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other.[105] A hotel caught on fire, but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze. Another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor.[106] Media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows.[105] Irma killed four people on the French side of the island and injured 50 others, one of whom was in critical condition. As many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree; 60% of those were totally uninhabitable.[107] Estimates from CEDIM indicate a minimum of $950\u00a0million worth of economic losses.[87] Total losses exceeded \u20ac3.5\u00a0billion (US$4.17\u00a0billion).[92] A similar situation unfolded in Sint Maarten, Saint Martin's Dutch half, as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft \"as if they were matches\".[108] The hurricane wreaked havoc on Princess Juliana International Airport, with \"huge chunks of the building [strewn] across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half.\"[109] It demolished or severely damaged about 70% of Sint Maarten's houses, forcing thousands of residents into public shelters.[110] There were 4\u00a0deaths and 23 injuries,[7] 11 of which were serious, in the Dutch territory.[111] Irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit Sint Maarten; the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane.[108] Total damages were estimated at \u20ac2.5\u00a0billion (US$2.98\u00a0billion).[93]",
      "Saint Barth\u00e9lemy": "Irma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, southeast of Saint Martin. Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to \"a bomb that burned all vegetation,\" while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively \"erased the island from the map\".[114] Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.[115] Streets in the capital of Gustavia were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture. The island's fire station was inundated with up to 6.4\u00a0ft (2.0\u00a0m) of flood waters.[115][116] With scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed, the majority of the island's population was left stranded and without water, electricity or phone service.[114] The associated economic losses could exceed $480\u00a0million according to CEDIM's analysts.[87] Preliminary assessments from the French government indicate that Hurricane Irma caused a combined \u20ac1.2\u00a0billion (US$1.43\u00a0billion) in insured losses across the French territories of Saint-Martin and Saint Barts. This total covered private property such as homes, vehicles and businesses (including lost revenue); the extent of the damage to infrastructural and public facilities remains undetermined. Nonetheless, this made Irma one of the costliest natural disasters to hit the French Republic in 50\u00a0years.[117] On January 30, 2018, roughly five months after Irma, an analysis was published indicating that an anemometer on the island recorded an unofficial gust to 199\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h) before failing.[118]",
      "Anguilla": "The British Overseas Territory of Anguilla saw the eyewall of the storm pass over it on September 6. Many homes and schools were destroyed, and the island's only hospital was badly damaged.[7] The devastation was particularly severe in East End, where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses. In The Valley, the island's capital, the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings. Rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors, and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated.[119] About 90% of roads were left impassable.[7] The island's air traffic control tower was damaged, exacerbating the already poor communication with the island.[120] One death was reported on the island. Estimates of losses on the island total at least $190\u00a0million.[7]",
      "Rest of the Lesser Antilles": "Large swells ahead of Irma washed ashore debris and sea life in Castries, Saint Lucia, blocking some roads. Seaside roads were inundated with water.[121] One surfer was killed amid rough surf in Barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck. Trees were also destroyed.[122] The hurricane's effects, such as violent seas and rattling trees, were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in Guadeloupe. Several houses were damaged.[123] Around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm, leaving several communes in the dark without running water. Overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seas.[26] Saint Kitts and Nevis endured similar conditions to other islands. Blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the island's water system, but per the International Red Cross, the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere.[124] Still, Prime Minister Timothy Harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained \"significant damage.\"[37] The Dutch territories of Saba and Sint Eustatius were also struck by the hurricane's winds, resulting in infrastructural damage, water shortages and telecommunication outages.[119][125] Several houses were left uninhabitable. On Saba, the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people.[119][125] CEDIM's analysts expect economic losses of $20\u201365\u00a0million for the two islands.[87]",
      "British Virgin Islands": "Damage in the British Virgin Islands was extensive. Numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of Tortola, which bore the brunt of the hurricane's core. Four people were confirmed dead.[7] Along Cane Garden Bay, the storm surge submerged several seaside bars and a gas station. Satellite images revealed many of the island's residential zones had been left in ruins.[119] The hurricane passed over Necker Island, also causing severe damage and destroying the mansion of Richard Branson.[127] Most homes and businesses were destroyed on the island of Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the B.V.I.'s four main islands.[128] The Governor, Gus Jaspert, who had only been sworn into office 13 days previously, declared a state of emergency - the first time this has ever happened in the Territory.[129] After the storm, restoration of electricity took approximately 5\u00a0months.[130]",
      "U.S. Virgin Islands": "Irma's effects in the U.S. Virgin Islands were most profound on Saint Thomas, where at least 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain fell, and on Saint John. Saint Thomas island suffered widespread structural damage, including to its police station and airport. Patients from the fourth and third floors of Charlotte Amalie's hospital had to be relocated to lower floors due to flooding from roof leaks. Three deaths were attributed to Irma on the island. On nearby Saint Croix, there were communication issues and some damage to the infrastructure.[119] Saint John lost access to ferry and cargo services, along with access to the local airport. Due to its normal reliance on electricity from Saint Thomas, the island was left without power.[131][132][133][134] Total damage from the three islands was at least $1.1\u00a0billion.",
      "Puerto Rico": "The hurricane passed north of Puerto Rico, but still caused significant damage to the United States territory. Along the coast, a tide gauge observed waves up to 1.5\u00a0ft (0.46\u00a0m) mean higher high water. Much of the main island experienced sustained tropical storm force winds, with a peak sustained wind speed of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) at a weather station along San Juan Bay, while the same site observed a peak wind gust of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h).[7] However, on the island of Culebra, a wind gust of 111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h) was reported.[135] Mainly due to strong winds, approximately 1.1\u00a0million out of 1.5\u00a0million of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's customers lost electricity.[136] Portions of Puerto Rico received heavy rainfall, with a peak total of 13.04\u00a0in (331\u00a0mm) in Bayam\u00f3n,[7] causing seven rivers to reach flood stage, widespread flash flooding, and at least six landslides.[136] The most severely affected areas included the offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as the northeastern, northern, and mountainous portions of the main island. On Culebra, the island suffered an almost complete loss of electrical and water services. At least 30\u00a0homes on the island were destroyed, while about 30\u00a0other experienced substantial damage. High winds also toppled a number of trees. The only telecommunications tower on Culebra sustained damage, cutting off outside communications for several hours.[136] In rural Lo\u00edza, 79\u00a0homes were destroyed.[137] Throughout Puerto Rico, 781 out of 1,600 telecommunications towers went out of commission, primarily due to power outages. At least 362,000\u00a0customers lost water services. Debris, mostly fallen trees, blocked at least 72\u00a0roads. Approximately 25% to 30% of banana, coffee, papaya, and plantain crops were damaged by strong winds, with losses to farmers estimated at $30.6\u00a0million.[136] Approximately 1,530\u00a0homes experienced at least moderate damage, with 1,448\u00a0homes moderately damaged, 32\u00a0extensively damaged, and 50\u00a0completely destroyed.[138] Hurricane Irma was attributed to around $1\u00a0billion in damage,[91] and the NHC attributed three fatalities to Irma in Puerto Rico, though four deaths were related to the storm.[7][139] Two people died due to rainstorms ahead of the hurricane: one man died in Orocovis after falling off his ladder while repairing his roof; another man on the coast in Capitanejo died after being struck by lightning. Three nearby fishermen were burned by the same lightning strike, but survived. Two other people died during the hurricane: a woman died while being evacuated from her house in a wheelchair and fell, hitting her head; another person died in a car accident in Can\u00f3vanas.[140] Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 declared the islands of Culebra and Vieques to be disaster areas.[37]",
      "Hispaniola": "In the Dominican Republic, flooding worsened following Irma's departure, leading the number of displaced persons to increase to more than 24,000 by September 8. President Danilo Medina ordered further evacuations due to at-risk dams, while the government banned swimming in rivers and ordered boats kept in port.[240] More than 422,000 people were left without water due to 28 aqueducts being damaged.[241] In Haiti, officials stated that losses were greater than they could have been since people largely did not heed early preparation and evacuation warnings.[36] At least 5,000 homes were flooded. One man died trying to cross a flooded river; another went missing and 17 were injured.[242] The trash- and waste-contaminated floodwaters in places like Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Ouanaminthe, and Gonaives led to fears of cholera outbreaks.[141] Flooding continued to worsen days after the storm, as runoff from the mountains swelled rivers in low-lying farming communities. United Nations peacekeepers from Brazil were able to gain access to the flooded northwest region to provide urgent aid, but non-governmental organizations and Haitian economists warned that the estimated 30,000 victims would need longer-term assistance as well. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant appointed a government commission to address Irma's effects, with Action Against Hunger in charge of humanitarian coordination.[142]",
      "Turks and Caicos Islands": "On the evening of September 7, at 7:30\u00a0pm AST (23:30 UTC), Hurricane Irma reached the Turks and Caicos Islands. While the eye passed just south of the main islands, crossing over South Caicos and the Ambergris Cays, the most powerful winds on the northern side of the eye swept all of the islands for more than two hours. Communications infrastructure was destroyed.[7] On September 8, Minister of Infrastructure Goldray Ewing confirmed that damage to Providenciales was extensive, with the northwestern neighborhood of Blue Hill being \"gone\".[143] The hospital in the capital, Cockburn Town, was heavily damaged.[7] On South Caicos, 75% of roofs were lost.[144] Total damage was estimated at over $500\u00a0million.[7]",
      "The Bahamas": "By the afternoon of September 9, Bahamas Power and Light Company had dispatched crews across the archipelago to repair infrastructure damage. The southernmost islands, which were most severely affected by Irma's eye, remained largely inaccessible for days.[232] Assessments showed that 15% of the national telecommunications network had been affected, with at least one tower destroyed.[233] Bahamasair resumed a limited domestic schedule on September 10, with international flights still cancelled due to existing and anticipated destruction at other destinations.[234] The worst devastation occurred on Ragged Island, over which Irma's eye had directly passed. After days of the National Emergency Management Agency not being able to physically reach the island, officials were finally able to inspect it; they promptly declared it uninhabitable.[235][236] Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said that it was the worst disaster area he or his officials had ever seen, and that all remaining residents would need to leave, potentially permanently.[235][237] Business leaders and other officials called for a new long-term development model to shift the population away from such sparsely-settled islands.[238] On Grand Bahama and Bimini, where tornadoes associated with Irma touched down on September 10, more than 100 people were left displaced. Infrastructure damage included docks, parks, and the power system.[149] Aside from tangible asset losses, Irma brought significant economic damages. International freight shipping was projected to be offline for a week, and costs for rebuilding supplies were inflated due to demand in the U.S.[239]",
      "Cuba": "Swollen rivers contributed to worsening flooding in the days after the storm system left, resulting in additional evacuations. Officials resorted to using inflatable rafts to access affected areas. The national electrical infrastructure was said to be extensively damaged.[162]",
      "Other states": "Three deaths were reported in Georgia due to falling trees and debris, along with widespread wind damage and power outages throughout the state primarily due to fallen trees.[201] On Tybee Island, as well as St. Simons Island the storm surge caused extensive flooding.[202][203] The tropical storm also did $54 million in damage in the state.[204] In Charleston, South Carolina, the third highest storm surge on record was recorded, reaching a height of approximately 10\u00a0ft (3\u00a0m).[205] By of September 12, almost 100,000 had lost power in Upstate South Carolina.[206] Five people died in storm-related incidents across South Carolina, all from indirect incidents.[207] The tropical storm caused damages totaling $500,000 in the state.[208] Light damage occurred in other areas, including Tennessee.[209] About 75,000 customers in North Carolina lost power due to Irma.[210] It also caused $600,000 in damages in Alabama.[211]",
      "Aftermath": "In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Irma's path through the West Indies and Caribbean, the devastation to roads, harbors and airports significantly impeded the transportation and distribution of relief supplies. Foreign countries moved to provide much of the initial aid. The British, Dutch, French, and United States governments sent warships and planes with supplies and manpower to the region.[35][212] International leaders, including Dutch King Willem-Alexander and French President Emmanuel Macron, quickly moved to visit affected territories.[213][214] Some of the affected countries and territories also offered assistance to each other. Cuba, which sustained extensive damage from the storm, sent 750 health workers to Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, Dominica, and Haiti.[215] Government officials and members of the public in Puerto Rico delivered assistance and evacuated people stranded on other islands. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services granted special 30-day humanitarian visas for British Virgin Islanders to stay in Puerto Rico.[216] Hundreds of people stranded on Saint Martin were flown to the Dominican Republic on humanitarian grounds.[217]",
      "British Overseas Territories": "RFA Mounts Bay stationed itself near Anguilla and provided support and relief work to the island with its helicopters and 40 marines and army engineers.[219] The ship delivered 6 tonnes of emergency aid to Anguilla and army engineers repaired a fuel leak at Anguilla's main petrol dump, restored power to the island's hospital and provided shelters for those left homeless by the hurricane.[220][221] The ship arrived in the British Virgin Islands on September 8, 2017, to provide emergency relief to the islands, including providing shelters, food and water.[220] HMS Ocean was diverted from the Mediterranean to provide relief from Gibraltar to the affected British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos on September 7,[222] and aid was also supplied by the Department for International Development from their disaster response centre at Kemble Airfield. As part of a \u00a332\u00a0million operation named Operation Ruman, nearly 500 UK military personnel with emergency relief were dispatched from RAF Brize Norton.[223] This included the first deployment of No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing with 3 RAF aircraft; 2 Airbus A400M Atlas and 1 C130J hercules to support relief efforts. The British government also drafted 2 members of the UK police calibre into the region on September 10, and 53 police officers were drafted from RAF Brize Norton to the affected British Overseas Territories on September 15 to help maintain order.[224][225] UK politicians, including the chairs of the foreign affairs and development select committees, criticized both the government's preparations for the storm and its response as inadequate.[226][227] By September 12, the Department for International Development had delivered more than 40 tonnes of aid into the region, including into Turks and Caicos, and 1,000 UK military troops were deployed in the region as part of relief efforts.[221] The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, pledged an additional \u00a325\u00a0million worth of funding as part of relief efforts in the region on September 13, 2017, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Boris Johnson, said that a further 250 UK military personnel would be deployed into the area within the next few days.[228] Anguilla's Chief Minister, Victor Banks, praised the British government's response to the storm and said that Boris Johnson's visit to the island \"sends a very positive signal to Anguillans that the British are serious about their response to this very severe hurricane\", but went on to say that the current financial commitment from the UK was not substantial enough.[228][229] By September 15, the United Kingdom had over 70 military personnel and 4 police officers in Anguilla and had delivered 15 tonnes of aid to the island.[230] In the British Virgin Islands, Royal Marines had cleared the airfield so that it was operational for the delivery of aid into the islands, with more than 200 British military personnel and 54 UK police officers on the ground and 8 tonnes of aid delivered to the islands.[230] 120 British military personnel were on the ground in Turks and Caicos, and over 150 shelter kits and 720 liters of water were delivered to the islands on September 15.[230] Amendments to international aid rules by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (or OECD) allowed for the UK government to provide access to \u00a313 billion worth of aid to the affected British Overseas Territories, through the UK's Official Development Assistance (ODA) by November 2017.[231]",
      "United States territories": "In the USVI, residents and tourists alike were described as being in a state of traumatic shock.[162] By September 7, the USS Wasp amphibious assault ship had arrived in the USVI to provide supplies, damage assessment, and evacuation assistance. Four additional warships, some of which had already been on their way to Texas to assist with Hurricane Harvey relief, were redirected to the region.[212] At a September 10 news conference, Governor Kenneth Mapp described Irma as a \"horrific disaster\" for which \"[t]here will be no restorations or solutions in days or weeks.\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency airlifted in goods for residents, who were subjected to a curfew. Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line agreed to transport tourists to Florida, contingent upon port availability following the state's own experience with Irma.[243] On Saint John, described as \"perhaps the site of Irma's worst devastation on American soil,\" it took six days for an active-theater disaster zone to be established, leading to criticism of the U.S. government response.[244] The National Guard was delayed in reaching Saint John due to the number of overturned boats left in the harbor.[245] The National Guard was brought in to maintain order, while the Coast Guard brought evacuees to cruise ships bound for San Juan and Miami.[244] There was still no electricity on St. John in the middle of October 2017.[246] By September 9, more than one million Puerto Ricans were still without power, tens of thousands were without water, and several thousand were still in shelters. Hospitals were operating on generator power. The government was struggling to establish contact with the islands of Culebra and Vieques.[37] By September 10, the main island had recovered enough to serve as a refuge for people stranded on other islands, including 1,200 tourists from Saint Martin and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Airlifts had brought more than 50 patients to Puerto Rico.[216] Five months after Irma, two-thirds of the hospital beds on Saint Thomas were still unavailable, due to extensive physical damage and staffing shortages.[247]",
      "Saint Martin and French Overseas Department": "Damage to Sint Maarten's harbour and to Princess Juliana International Airport left the Dutch part of Saint Martin unreachable, although the smaller Grand Case-Esp\u00e9rance Airport on the French side could be reopened by September 7 for supply aid by helicopter and airplane.[248] The French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops on board a CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft. The following day, the Dutch military was able to airlift dialysis patients off the island while also dropping leaflets to warn islanders about the rapidly approaching Hurricane Jose.[64] Although the airport was closed, 435 students and faculty of the American University of the Caribbean were evacuated by the U.S. military.[249] On September 10, Dutch King Willem-Alexander departed for the region, with intentions to visit Sint Maarten and other affected Dutch territories and commonwealth members.[213] French President Emmanuel Macron followed this announcement by stating his intentions to visit the French part of the island on September 12 in order to bring aid supplies. In response to criticism of the French handling of the disaster, 1,000 troops, police, and other emergency workers were sent to Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy.[214] On both sides of Saint Martin, desperate conditions combined with food and water shortages in Irma's aftermath led to reports of violence, scavenging, and theft. In response, the French government increased its troop deployment to 2,200 and the Dutch government sent more than 600 military and police personnel.[226][250] The day after the hurricane hit Saint Barthelemy the French armed forces based in Guadeloupe and French Guiana flew equipment and troops into the reopened Grand Case-Esp\u00e9rance Airport. On September 7 and 9, equipment and personnel were flown from France to Guadeloupe and Martinique.[251]",
      "Records": "Irma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall. When Irma reached Category\u00a05 intensity with winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) at 11:45\u00a0UTC on September 5 at 57.7\u00b0W,[7] it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later.[271] By 00:15\u00a0UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with 180\u00a0mph (285\u00a0km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 914\u00a0mbar (914\u00a0hPa; 27.0\u00a0inHg). This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998 and Hurricane Rita of 2005 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed. Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h), and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h).[272] At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian,[273] and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007.[274] In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category\u00a05 strength winds,[7] and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9\u00a0units. Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.[275][276] On September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength. This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally \u2013 in terms of sustained winds \u2013 trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of 195\u00a0mph (314\u00a0km/h) at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of 190\u00a0mph (310\u00a0km/h) at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of 185\u00a0mph (298\u00a0km/h) at landfall.[277][278] Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category\u00a05 status since Felix in 2007.[279] Irma is the first recorded Category\u00a05 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995. In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category\u00a05 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924.[274] Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5\u00a0hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5\u00a0hurricane.[280] Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (931\u00a0hPa; 27.5\u00a0inHg), making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992. In the span of two weeks, two Category\u00a04 hurricanes\u2014Harvey and Irma\u2014struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season.[281][282] This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes. The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004.[275]",
      "Retirement": "Because of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018; it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.[283]",

      "Hurricane Ginny": " Hurricane Ginny was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall in Canada, as well as the latest hurricane on a calendar year to affect the U.S. state of Maine. The eighth tropical storm, as well as the seventh and final hurricane of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Ginny developed on October\u00a016 over the Bahamas, although it was not initially a fully tropical cyclone. As it moved to the North and later northwest, Ginny intensified to hurricane status as it became more tropical. For eight days, it was located within 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) of the United States coastline. After approaching North Carolina, Ginny looped to the southwest and approached within 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) of the Florida coastline. It turned to the North, to the East, and later to the northeast, strengthening late in its duration to peak winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h). Ginny became an extratropical cyclone shortly after striking Nova Scotia at its peak intensity on October\u00a029. Although it remained close to the United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts in South Carolina and New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Hurricane Ginny were from a trough that extended from the Bahamas to Bermuda in the middle of October.[1] On October\u00a016, a depression formed near the Turks and Caicos islands after a tropical wave interacted with the trough,[2] although initially it was not tropical in nature due to the widespread presence of cold air.[1] The system initially moved generally northward, attaining gale\u2013force winds on October\u00a019 as it turned to the northwest.[3] For several days, Ginny maintained a hybrid-type structure, and although it attained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a020, it was not a true hurricane.[1] It closely approached the North Carolina coastline, passing 135\u00a0mi (220\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Lookout before turning abruptly to the northeast. It executed a small loop and began a steady motion to the southeast while located over the Gulf Stream.[1] This motion was due to a large ridge located over New England.[2] On October\u00a021, the hurricane became better organized and began transitioning into a tropical cyclone.[4] By early on October\u00a022, Hurricane Hunters indicated that Ginny completed the transition into a fully tropical cyclone, observing an eye 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] On October\u00a023, Ginny briefly weakened to tropical storm status as it was moving toward Florida, although within 10\u00a0hours it regained hurricane intensity. Its motion to the southwest was unusual but not unique, and resembled the tracks of the 1935 Yankee hurricane and Hurricane Able in 1951.[1] On October\u00a024, it turned sharply northeastward off the northeast Florida coast,[3] coming within 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) of Daytona Beach.[1] The hurricane continued paralleling the coast of the Southeastern United States, turning northeast away from Georgia and South Carolina. On October\u00a026, Ginny turned to the east away from the United States,[3] having been located within 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) of the country's coast for eight consecutive days.[1] The next day, the hurricane began a motion to the northeast, accelerating in advance of an approaching trough.[5] It gradually intensified, reaching peak winds of 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a029. Later that day, Ginny made landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia while only weakening slightly with sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), making it the strongest tropical cyclone known to have made landfall in Canada.[6] Ginny became extratropical shortly thereafter, and its remnants dissipated on October\u00a030 in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.[3]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Early in its duration, the precursor to Ginny dropped high amounts of rainfall. Monci\u00f3n in the Dominican Republic reported 6.83\u00a0in (173\u00a0mm), and Green Turtle Cay in the Bahamas reported 4.20\u00a0in (107\u00a0mm).[7] Despite Ginny's proximity to the United States for over a week, a hurricane warning was only issued from Charleston, South Carolina, and Cape Fear, North Carolina, as well as Cape Hatteras. This represented about one-sixth of the entire coastline that was threatened by the storm. In Jacksonville, Florida, Ginny produced winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[1] Rainfall in the state peaked at 1.32\u00a0in (34\u00a0mm) at Saint Augustine.[8] Tides in Daytona Beach were 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal, which caused beach erosion and minor property damage. Further north, minor damage and beach erosion was likewise reported in Georgia.[1] Along the South Carolina coast, Ginny dropped beneficial rainfall,[9] which alleviated the state's worst drought conditions on record.[10] The rainfall peaked at 5.06\u00a0in (129\u00a0mm) in Isle of Pines.[1] The hurricane approached North Carolina twice.[1] During the second time, residents in low-lying areas and along the coast evacuated.[11] As it passed the area, Ginny produced sustained winds that were estimated at 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on Cape Fear, with gusts to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[12] These were the highest winds related to the hurricane,[1] although they may have been overestimated.[12] In addition, the heaviest rainfall related to the storm occurred near Southport, where 6.71\u00a0in (170\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell.[13] Tides along the coast were 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal,[1] which caused minor flooding and destroyed one house in Carolina Beach.[11] In Virginia, the hurricane caused minor flooding and minimal beach erosion.[14] During Ginny's first approach through the region, it produced gale-force winds along the Virginia coast, although it did not do so during its second approach.[15] Later, a gale warning was issued for New England due to Ginny's threat,[1] as well as a hurricane watch for Long Island and southern New England.[16] Across the region, the strongest winds on land were 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) along Nantucket, where a gust of 76\u00a0mph (122\u00a0km/h) was also reported. However, a boat offshore Portland, Maine reported 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) seas and winds of at least 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[1] In New York City, the outskirts of the storm dropped 0.10\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0mm) of precipitation, and tides were 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) above normal.[16] Rainfall in eastern New England surpassed 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm),[13] peaking at 3.92\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) in Machias, Maine.[17] The rainfall was beneficial across the region,[1] ending a 28-day drought.[18] Along Cape Cod and in Maine, high winds from the storm downed several trees, some of which fell onto power lines.[19] About 1,000\u00a0homes in Chatham, Massachusetts lost power. In Nantucket, high waves caused additional erosion in an area affected by Hurricane Esther two years prior. Damage was heavier in Maine, where many boats were damaged or broke from their moorings. One person died from a heart attack while trying to rescue his boat.[20] Several small buildings in the state were destroyed, and the post office in Calais, Maine lost its roof.[19] Ginny was the latest hurricane on record to affect Maine.[21] During its passage, Ginny brought an influx of cold air over New England that produced the first snowfall of the season across Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire. In most locations, the snow quickly melted, although higher totals occurred in northern Maine, the highest being 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) on Mount Katahdin. The snow killed a mountain climber and a park ranger.[20] Damage from Ginny in the United States was estimated at $400,000.[1] As the remnants of Ginny moved across Atlantic Canada, they produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 4.53\u00a0in (113\u00a0mm) in southern New Brunswick. Winds peaked at 99\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) in Greenwood, Nova Scotia. The winds blew down trees in the Halifax area, and there were power outages reported there and in Antigonish. High waves broke boats from their moorings, causing them to either wash ashore or float out to sea. Ferry service across the region was canceled. In neighboring New Brunswick, the storm caused outages to telephone and electric services. Several injuries were reported, although there were no fatalities. The entirety of Prince Edward Island was also left without power.[22]",

      "Cyclone Niran": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Niran was a very powerful tropical cyclone that brought severe impacts to extreme Northeastern Australia and nearly made landfall in New Caledonia in February and March 2021. The sixth tropical cyclone and the second severe tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 Australian region cyclone season, while being the third severe tropical cyclone of the annual South Pacific cyclone season, Niran was the second Category 5 severe tropical cyclone in the South Pacific cyclone season, following Cyclone Yasa. The cyclone formed from a tropical low in the Coral Sea on 27 February. The tropical low gradually intensified while stalling offshore of Queensland for several days, although disorganized at the time. Early on 3 March, Niran pulled away from the coast of Australia, while it started undergoing rapid intensification. Eventually, Niran reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian Tropical Cyclone Scale and the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, on 5 March, well offshore of Australia. Soon afterward, Niran initiated an eyewall replacement cycle and encountered some wind shear, causing the storm to weaken on 6 March, as it passed just to the south of Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. Afterwards, Niran continued rapidly weakening as wind shear increased further, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone late on 6 March. Niran was absorbed into another extratropical storm two days later. Before its strengthening phase, Niran significantly affected the banana crop in far-north Queensland. Several farms abroad were damaged, and some farmers lost 100% of their banana crop. Prices for the fruit were expected to rise. Estimates placed damage to the crop at a minimum of AU$180 million (US$140 million). Other infrastructure damage was minor. In New Caledonia, many houses had their roofs and infrastructure damaged, and nearly 70,000 people lost power in total. Multiple roads became impassable. Two people in New Caledonia were injured, though no one was killed. Total economic losses reached $200 million (2021 USD).[1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "During 27 February, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) began to monitor a developing tropical low off the coast of northern Queensland.[2] The low began to strengthen while remaining offshore of the state, within an area favorable for tropical cyclogenesis.[3] On 1 March, the tropical low was upgraded into a tropical cyclone by the BOM, and was given the name Niran.[4] Later that same day, the strengthening cyclone reached Category 2 tropical cyclone status on the Australian scale.[5] Niran began to pull away from the coast of Australia and underwent rapid intensification, reaching Category 3 severe tropical cyclone status on the Australian scale late on 3 March,[6] and then reaching Category 4 severe tropical cyclone status on the Australian scale late on 4 March.[7] Eventually, Niran intensified into a powerful Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian region and the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), at 12:00 UTC on 5 March, displaying a well-defined pinhole eye. Shortly afterward, the storm crossed into the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS)'s area of responsibility, even as it accelerated southeastward towards New Caledonia. Around that time, Niran reached its peak intensity, attaining maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), and a central minimum pressure of 931 millibars (27.5\u00a0inHg).[8] However, several hours later, Niran began an eyewall replacement cycle and encountered wind shear, causing the storm to begin yet another significant weakening trend, with the storm falling down back to Category 4 status on the SSHWS. At 12:00 UTC on 6 March, Niran made its closest approach to New Caledonia's main island of Grande Terre, as a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone, as the eye of the storm passed just south of the island's southeastern flank. As wind shear continued to substantially increase over the storm, it weakened to a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and a Category 2 tropical cyclone on the SSHWS, later that day, as it began undergoing extratropical transition. Late that day, Niran had completed its extratropical transition as it continued accelerating towards the southeast. Niran continued moving southeastward for another couple of days, before being absorbed into a larger extratropical cyclone to the south on 8 March.[citation needed]",
      "Preparation and impacts[edit]": "",
      "Australia[edit]": "",
      "Queensland[edit]": "A warning was put in place for the coast of Northern Queensland; however, the warning was dropped as Niran moved eastward and away from the coast.[9] A gale warning was issued on 2 March for coastal and island communities, Cape Flattery and Innisfail, though it was cancelled when Niran moved away.[10] In the far-north region of the state, some banana crops were wiped out by Niran in its early phase. Some farmers said they had lost nearly 100% of their banana crops. In total, over 42,000 people lost power from the storm, due to high winds. State emergency teams were sent to attend to downed poles and damaged homes, and they reported minor structural damage in the Cairns region. The Australian Banana Growers\u2019 Council said on 2 March that it was too early to estimate damage, but stated it would be significant. In the Cassowary Coast Region, farmers were expected to be without income until September or October. Two people were rescued from floodwaters.[11] On 5 March, farmers assessed the crop damage to range between AU$180\u2013200 million.[12] There were fears that the prices for bananas would increase drastically again, as had occurred after Cyclone Larry in 2006 and Cyclone Yasi in 2011. They were expected to increase by 50 cents to $1 a kilo after Niran.[13] Damage to farm infrastructure was labeled \"catastrophic\" and \"severe\" by locals. In production nurseries, shade houses and tree crops were damaged. Stephen Lowe, the council chief executive of the Australian Banana Growers\u2019 Council, estimated about 5,000 hectares of crops were affected, and 150 farms were damaged;[8][14] however, over 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) may have been damaged, and clean-up could take upwards of a year.[13] Niran was estimated to have destroyed around one-third of Australia's banana crops.[15] The highest recorded total for rainfall was in Clump Point, which saw 276\u00a0mm (10.9\u00a0in) of rain in 24 hours.[10]",
      "New Caledonia[edit]": "As the storm approached, New Caledonia was placed on high alert, as Niran was expected to cause severe damage in the country, especially on the main island of Grande Terre.[16][8] Authorities placed the entire island nation under a Level Two Tropical Cyclone Alert late on 5 March as the storm bore down on the country.[17] Air Cal\u00e9donie moved their entire fleet of airplanes to Brisbane, Australia, in order to protect them from the storm.[citation needed] Waves as high as 13 metres (43\u00a0ft) were also expected for the western side of New Caledonia.[16] Niran caused extensive damage in New Caledonia during its close passage.[15] 39,000 households lost electricity in urban areas while roads quickly became impassable.[18] Winds of up to 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) affected portions of the country in its passage, despite the strongest portion of the storm missing the coastline.[19] Two people were injured, including a child which was hit by shards of glass from a bay window.[20][21] In the capital city of Noum\u00e9a, several ships were forced aground on the coast.[20]  400 people were also housed in three evacuation centers. Another estimate placed over 69,000 total customers without power in the country.[22] Rainfall was less than anticipated, with a report of 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) of rain falling in six hours. Vegetation and crops were damaged as well, though the true extent of the damage is unknown.[23]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "High waves were also expected to affect Vanuatu, with wave heights up to 8 metres (26\u00a0ft) forecasted. Heavy rain from the cyclone was also briefly forecasted to impact Vanuatu.[16] There were no reports of damage in the country.",

      "Typhoon Gene": " Typhoon Gene, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Oyang, struck Japan during late September 1990. An area of disturbed weather formed several hundred kilometers south-southeast of Okinawa on September 18. Gradual development occurred as it tracked generally westward, and on September 22, the disturbance developed into a tropical depression. The depression intensified into a tropical storm the next day. Continuing to steadily intensify, Gene turned northwest and became a severe tropical storm on September 25. In the evening, Gene was declared a typhoon, and on September 26, attained its maximum intensity. Gene leveled off in intensity while recurving towards Japan. After brushing Kyushu and Shikoku on September 29 and Honshu on September 20, Gene weakened back to a tropical storm. On September 30, Gene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which was last noted on October 1. The typhoon hit the Japanese archipelago ten days after Typhoon Flo, which killed 40 people. The southwestern portion of the country suffered the worst damage from the typhoon. Nationwide, six fatalities were reported and twenty others sustained injuries. In Miyazaki Prefecture, three people were killed and ten others were wounded. Throughout the prefecture, 4,688 houses were damaged and ninety-two others were destroyed, which led to 18,449 homeless. A total 210 houses were destroyed while 13,318 others were flooded. Elsewhere, 229 houses were damaged in Kagoshima Prefecture and seventy more were destroyed; consequently, 194 people lost their homes. There, almost 30,000 homes lost power. Overall, there were 340 landslides and roads were damaged at 182 locations. All Nippon Airways cancelled ninety domestic flights and Japan Airlines cancelled ten flights. Over 200,000 people were affected by cancellation of flights and train services. Thirty-one ships and 10,560 acres (4,270 hectares) of farmland were damaged. Monetary damage estimates reached \u00a522.9 billion yen or $158 million USD in 1990 values.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Typhoon Gene, the fifth tropical cyclone of September 1990, can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather with a surface pressure of 1008\u00a0mbar (29.8\u00a0inHg) first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 06:00 UTC early on September 18. Little development occurred over the next five days,[1] although the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the disturbance as a tropical depression on the morning of September 22.[2][nb 1] A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued at 06:00 UTC on September 23, followed by an increase in the disturbance's organization.[1] Around that time, the system was located roughly 1,170\u00a0km (725\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Okinawa.[4] Further development was aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to its west and the warm ocean waters of the Kuroshio Current. Initially, the disturbance tracked generally westward, south of a subtropical ridge. Shower activity steadily increased and a Dvorak estimate of T2.0/55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) prompted the JTWC to designate it a tropical depression midday on September 23.[1] Twelve hours later, the JMA reported that the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm,[5][nb 2] and after the system improved in organization and its outflow expanded,[1] the JTWC followed suit.[7] At this time, Tropical Storm Gene was situated 980\u00a0km (610\u00a0mi) south-southeast of Okinawa.[4] Tropical Storm Gene intensified at the climatological rate of one T number per day as it tracked westward on a course initially resembling a straight runner.[1] At 00:00 UTC on September 25, the JMA classified Gene as a severe tropical storm.[2] The storm then turned northwest as it approached a break in the subtropical ridge. Although restricted upper-level outflow prevented rapid intensification, a Dvorak intensity estimate of T4.0/120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph)[1] lead to both agencies to declare Gene a typhoon on the evening of September 25.[5] Around the time of the upgrade, Gene was located 380\u00a0km (235\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Okinawa.[4] At 00:00 UTC on September 26, the JMA raised its intensity to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) for its maximum sustained winds, while the agency also estimated a minimum pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg).[2] However, the JTWC suggested that Gene was still slowly strengthening, and did not attain its maximum intensity of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) until 18:00 UTC that day.[7] Gene recurved to the northeast on September 27 in response to a shortwave trough[1] while passing through the Ryukyu Islands.[4] According to the JTWC, Gene maintained its peak intensity until 06:00 UTC on September 29,[1] although the JMA estimated that a weakening trend had begun six hours earlier.[2] The typhoon continued to recurve and skirted Kyushu and Shikoku on September 29 before tracking just south of Honshu the following day.[4] Based on surface observations, the JTWC downgraded Gene into a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC that day,[1] with the JMA doing the same at around the same time. The JMA classified Gene as an extratropical cyclone at noon,[2] even though the JTWC did not follow suit until six hours later.[1] Finally, the JMA stopped tracking the extratropical remnants of Gene on October 1.[5]",
      "Impact[edit]": "The typhoon dropped heavy rainfall across much of the Japanese archipelago.[8] A peak rainfall total occurred of 619\u00a0mm (24.4\u00a0in) in the city of Miyazaki, 563\u00a0mm (22.2\u00a0in) of which fell in a 24-hour time span.[9] A peak hourly rainfall total of 91\u00a0mm (3.6\u00a0in) was observed at Shimizu.[10] Moreover, a maximum wind gust of 159\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) was recorded on Muroto.[11] In Tokushima Prefecture, a minimum central pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg) was observed.[12] In Okinawa Prefecture, one person was hurt and damage accumulated to \u00a577.2 million yen.[13] On Shikoku Island, little damage was reported.[12] A total of 214 homes were damaged in K\u014dchi Prefecture and ten others were leveled. There were also eleven landslides. Damage in the prefecture totaled \u00a51.2 billion yen.[14] Two people were killed in Miyazaki Prefecture because of landslides and another drowned into a river,[15] and an additional ten were wounded. Throughout the prefecture, 4,688 houses suffered damage, while an additional ninety-two dwellings were destroyed, which led to 18,449 homeless. Furthermore, 2,700 households lost power in the city Miyazaki while 8,339 households lost power in Nichinan. Prefecture-wide, damage totaled \u00a510.8 billion yen, primarily from the western portion of the prefecture.[16] In Kagoshima Prefecture, five people suffered injuries, including two in a landslide. A total of 229 houses were damaged and seventy more were destroyed; consequently, 194 people lost their homes. In the town of Takayama, located in Kagoshima Prefecture, over 100,000 fish died. According to authorities, nearly 30,000 residencies were left without power. Across the prefecture, damage amounted to \u00a515.3 billion yen.[17] Throughout the entire island of Kyushu, 150 national flights were cancelled.[18] In Wakayama Prefecture, sixty-seven homes were damaged and damage was estimated at \u00a5187 million yen. Four buildings were destroyed in Shingu City, resulting in twenty homeless.[19] Three flights were cancelled and three others were delayed at the Okayama Airport.[20] Elsewhere, in\nKanagawa Prefecture, heavy rains triggered fifty-nine landslides. A total of 1,713 homes were damaged and 915 others were destroyed, which resulted in 2,956 homeless individuals.[21] Ninety bullet trains were cancelled between Tokyo and Osaka.[15] In nearby Oshima Subprefecture, heavy rains forced the closure of nine roads. Throughout Tokyo, eight structures were damaged and twelve flights were delayed.[22] A 49-year-old man was killed in a landslide in Shizuoka.[15] Across Shizuoka prefecture, heavy rains caused 143 landslides. There, 1,697 homes were damaged, with 144 others destroyed. Roads were damaged in 162 locations. Nearly 900\u00a0ha (2,225 acres) of arable land was inundated.[23] In Mie Prefecture, two people were presumed dead after they drowned in a river and three others were hurt. A total of 1,079 homes were damaged and thirty-nine others were demolished, which resulted in 130 people homeless. Damage there was assessed at \u00a52.62 billion yen.[24] At the Narita International Airport, sixty-eight flights were delayed. In Chiba Prefecture, there was one minor injury. A total of 213 houses were destroyed and eighteen others were damaged. Embankments were damaged at eighty-five sites across the prefecture.[25] Seventy-five individuals lost their homes in Yamanashi Prefecture, where damage totaled to \u00a5716 million yen.[26] Elsewhere, 304 dwellings were damaged and twenty-eight were demolished along coastal areas of Saitama Prefecture.[27] Damage in Gunma prefecture totaled \u00a553.8 million yen.[28] The typhoon hit the Japanese archipelago ten days after Typhoon Flo,[29] which claimed forty lives and caused over $4 billion in damage.[30] The storm also forced the cancellation of the final round of the Top Cup Tokai Classic.[31] Much of the southwestern portion of the country suffered the worst damage from the typhoon.[29] Nationwide, six fatalities were reported and twenty others sustained injuries. A total 210 houses were destroyed while 13,318 others were flooded.[8] Landslides triggered by heavy rain were reported at 340 places and roads were damaged at 182 locations.[4] All Nippon Airways cancelled ninety domestic flights and Japan Airlines cancelled ten flights.[15] More than 200,000 people were affected by cancellation of flights and train services.[4] Thirty-one ships and 10,560 acres (4,273\u00a0ha) of farmland were damaged. Monetary damage totaled \u00a522.9 billion yen or US$158 million.[8][nb 3][nb 4]",

      "Hurricane Fiona": "  Hurricane Fiona was a large, powerful, and destructive Category 4 Atlantic hurricane which was the costliest and most intense tropical or post-tropical cyclone to hit Canada on record. It was the sixth named storm, third hurricane and first major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. Fiona developed from a tropical wave that emerged from West Africa, before developing into a tropical depression east of the Leeward Islands on September\u00a014. Though under the influence of moderate to strong wind shear, the system was able to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Fiona later that same day. On September\u00a016, Fiona passed over Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea, where atmospheric conditions improved, and strengthened into a hurricane as it approached Puerto Rico two days later. A few hours afterward, the eye of Fiona made landfall along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, near Punta Tocon, between the municipalities of Lajas and Cabo Rojo. The hurricane made landfall in the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter, and then strengthened into the first major hurricane of the season. As the storm slowly moved through the Turks and Caicos, it continued to strengthen and reached Category 4 status the following day, while accelerating north. The storm reached peak 1-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (27.49\u00a0inHg). After passing Bermuda and weakening to Category\u00a03 intensity, Fiona quickly transitioned into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone and struck Nova Scotia with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) early on September 24. Post-tropical Fiona then quickly weakened as it moved through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and over the southeastern Labrador Peninsula. The remnants then dissipated over the Labrador Sea near the southwest coast of Greenland on September\u00a027. Guadeloupe received near-record rainfall, leaving 40% of the population without water for a few days. Puerto Rico suffered from the worst flooding since Hurricane Maria of 2017, and an island-wide blackout occurred. A third of the territory's population was left without water, and at least 25 people died. In the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos, the islands were pounded by heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing flooding and blackouts. Fiona was the strongest cyclone on record to make landfall in Canada based on atmospheric pressure[3] and was one of the wettest ever recorded in the country as well.",
      "Meteorological history": "Early on September\u00a012, 2022, the NHC began to monitor a tropical wave over the central tropical Atlantic for gradual development, though environmental conditions for development were assessed as only marginally favorable.[4] Even so, shower and thunderstorm activity within the disturbance began to become more concentrated later that same day,[5] then increased and became better organized during the next day.[6] The circulation associated with the system became more defined and persisted overnight and into the morning of September\u00a014, attaining sufficient organization to designated as Tropical Depression Seven later that day.[7] Despite the continued effects of moderate westerly shear and dry mid-level air flow,[8] new satellite imagery indicated the depression had strengthened, thus at 01:45\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, it became Tropical Storm Fiona.[9] The storm passed over Guadeloupe with 50\u00a0mph (45\u00a0kn; 80\u00a0km/h) winds on September\u00a016, as it entered the eastern Caribbean.[10] Early on September\u00a018, the storm strengthened into a hurricane as it approached Puerto Rico.[11] A few hours later, the eye of Fiona made landfall along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico near Punta Tocon between the municipalities of Lajas and Cabo Rojo at 19:20\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour (135\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.12\u00a0inHg).[12] The storm emerged over the Mona Passage and strengthened slightly further before making landfall in the Dominican Republic near Boca de Yuma around 07:30\u00a0UTC the next morning, with maximum sustained winds of 80 knots (90\u00a0mph; 150\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.85\u00a0inHg).[13] Fiona weakened slightly over land, but after emerging off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and back over the Atlantic Ocean, it began to intensify again, reaching Category\u00a02 intensity at 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019.[14] Fiona then reached Category\u00a03 intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC the next morning, becoming the first major hurricane of the season.[15] Gradual strengthening continued and Fiona became a Category\u00a04 hurricane at 06:00\u00a0UTC September\u00a021.[16] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, Fiona attained a minimum central pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (27.5\u00a0inHg) (its lowest pressure while a tropical cyclone) at 30.8\u00b0N, the lowest such value at this latitude over the North Atlantic Ocean since at least 1979.[17][18] Fiona then weakened slightly, dropping to Category 3 status at 09:00 UTC,[19] but restrengthened back to Category 4 strength six hours later;[20] at that time, with a central pressure of 936\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg) or lower, the storm was also the most intense Category\u00a04 Atlantic hurricane on record at such a northerly latitude.[21] Six hours later, as it began interact with a mid- to upper-level trough, Fiona began to slowly weaken again and accelerated to the north-northeast at 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h),[22] and subsequently became a post-tropical cyclone as it became embedded within the larger-scale trough while still maintaining major hurricane-force winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Steady weakening continued and by 07:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, the center of Fiona made landfall with estimated winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on the Canso Peninsula, Nova Scotia, near Whitehead; based on observations from a nearby weather station at Hart Island and the East Chedabucto Bay buoy, the central pressure at the time was estimated to have been 931\u00a0mbar (27.5\u00a0inHg), the lowest measured on record in association with a landfalling post-tropical cyclone in Canada, and a new national record from any storm.[23][24][25] Wind gusts across Nova Scotia recorded figures in excess of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), with Arisaig recording a peak of 179\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph).[24] Extremely large waves reached the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia late September 24. Buoy data indicated wave heights of 5 to 8\u00a0m (16 to 26\u00a0ft). The largest offshore waves were near and east of Fiona's path; this was indicated by satellite data and reports from a buoy over Banquereau Bank where waves averaged 12 to 15\u00a0m (39 to 49\u00a0ft) with peak waves as high as 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft).[24] Fiona then moved over Cape Breton Island with hurricane-strength winds and hit Prince Edward Island. It continued to weaken as it moved northward into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.[26] When the NHC issued its final advisory on Fiona at 21:00\u00a0UTC that same day, it was centered about 80 miles (130\u00a0km) northwest of Port aux Basques, Newfoundland, and had maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[27] Fiona would continue to weaken as it moved erratically northward into the northwestern Atlantic before dissipating west of Greenland over Baffin Bay on September 27.",
      "Preparations": "After the naming of Fiona, tropical storm watches were issued for the islands of Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, and Anguilla.[28] These were raised to tropical storm warnings two advisories later with watches extended south to Guadeloupe, St. Barthelemy, and St. Martin.[29] As Fiona moved west, tropical storm watches then warnings were put in place for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Parts of the Dominican Republic also had tropical storm watches put in place.[30][31][32] On September 17, the first hurricane watches were put in place for Puerto Rico and soon after, the Dominican Republic. By 14:00 UTC the same day, the hurricane watch in Puerto Rico was upgraded to a hurricane warning with the watch extended to the U.S. Virgin Islands.[33][34] As a result, Virgin Islands National Park closed.[35] On approach to Atlantic Canada, Fiona's unprecedented strength prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre to warn residents of \"heavy rainfall\" and powerful \"hurricane force winds\". The center also called the event \"severe\".[36] Bob Robichaud, a meteorologist for Environment and Climate Change Canada, said the storm will be one that \"everybody remembers\".[37] The Kejimkujik National Park temporarily closed due to the extratropical cyclone.[38]",
      "Impact": "At least 29 deaths have been confirmed throughout the Caribbean and Canada from Hurricane Fiona as of September 30. The search and rescue team took about two weeks to finish their search of people that were missing.",
      "Guadeloupe": "Guadeloupe received large amounts of rain, at a rate of more than 150\u00a0mm per hour in some places where the rivers washed away dozen of roads and bridges, and one person died when his house was washed away in the floods near the Rivi\u00e8re des P\u00e8res in the district of Basse-Terre. Firefighters carried out 130 interventions and 23 people were rescued. The cyclonic swell reached 2 to 4 metres (6.6 to 13.1\u00a0ft) and the gusts exceeded 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) with a peak of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) at Baie-Mahault and 98\u00a0km/h (61\u00a0mph) at Anse-Bertrand.[39] The storm left over 1.000 homeless and the minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Carenco declared area of natural disaster September 24 for 22 towns.[53]",
      "Puerto Rico": "At least 670 people were rescued from impacted sites following Fiona's deluge.[111] U.S. President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration for the island, allowing funding for search and rescue, debris removal, and shelter and food among other accommodations for a month.[112] Damage and debris left from Fiona disallowed rescuers and officials from entering affected areas. By September 22, 470 people and 48 pets remained in shelters.[63] Biden's disaster declaration also allowed FEMA to assist survivors in 55 municipalities and for public assistance in all 78 of them. 7 million liters of water, 4 million ready-to-eat meals, more than 215 generators, 100,000 tarps, and more were provided in four warehouses around Puerto Rico.[113] A few days after the hurricane struck, a delegation from United Hatzalah of Israel[114] arrived to provide psychological and emotional stabilization to those affected by the storm in various sections of the island.[115] Working together with local community leaders and organizations including PR4PR, Chabad, and FREMS, the team assisted hundreds of people in the municipalities of Anasco and Loiza providing them with basic medical check ups, and psychological first aid tools to help them cope with the aftermath of the storm.[citation needed] El Yunque National Forest partially re-opened from the storm on October 12.[116]",
      "Dominican Republic": "A few days after the hurricane, New York City mayor Eric Adams visited the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. After the visit, he requested a $3.7 billion supplemental bill for emergency and nutritional aid.[117]",
      "Turks and Caicos": "Fiona's eye passed through the Grand Turks island, severely affecting the telecommunications in the archipelago.[74] At least 40% of the territory was left without electricity, with total blackouts reported in North Caicos, Middle Caicos, South Caicos, Grand Turk and Salt Cay. 30% of Providenciales experienced power outages.[75] Moderate damage and no deaths were reported.[74]",
      "Bermuda": "Passing west of the island, Fiona's large size produced sustained tropical storm-force winds over Bermuda for several hours; L.F. Wade International Airport reported a gust of 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h).[76] Over 80% of the island lost power.[77]",
      "Eastern Canada": "Fiona made landfall near Whitehead, Nova Scotia, on the morning of September\u00a024 as a recently transitioned extratropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds.[88][89][90] Environment Canada assessed Fiona's maximum sustained winds at the time of landfall to be around 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h); these winds would be comparable to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[91] It was the strongest storm in Canadian history as gauged by barometric pressure; a pressure of 932.7\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.54\u00a0inHg) was unofficially measured on Hart Island, setting the all-time low pressure record for any landfalling cyclone on Canadian shores.[91] The pressure was also potentially lower than any other air pressure measurement along the coast of eastern Northern America outside of the United States Gulf Coast states. Other weather stations also documented pressures below the previous record of 940.2\u00a0mbar (27.76\u00a0inHg). A peak wind gust of 111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h) was recorded in Arisaig, Nova Scotia.[92] Peak gusts in other Canadian provinces included 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) at Wreckhouse, Newfoundland and Labrador, 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) at East Point, Prince Edward Island, 78\u00a0mph (126\u00a0km/h) on the Magdalen Islands of Quebec, and 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) on Miscou Island in New Brunswick.[91][93] Fiona also generated large waves and destructive storm surge, with the highest waves occurring east of the storm's center. A buoy on the Banquereau Bank registered wave heights as high as 98 feet (30\u00a0m) along with average wave heights of around 40\u201350 feet (12\u201315\u00a0m). The onshore push of storm surge led to record water level heights being set at Escuminac, New Brunswick, and Channel-Port aux Basques.[91] Rainfall totals from Fiona were less than anticipated due to the entrainment of dry air into the cyclone.[93] The heaviest rains fell in eastern Nova Scotia, where totals generally ranged between 100\u2013200\u00a0mm (3.9\u20137.9\u00a0in).[91] Fiona affected the four provinces of Atlantic Canada, as well as Quebec.[94][95][96] The storm caused major flooding in Quebec's Magdalen Islands, southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, northeastern Nova Scotia, and southern Newfoundland.[97] Thousands of trees were knocked down and uprooted in Nova Scotia from Halifax eastward, as well as most of southeastern New Brunswick, most of P.E.I., and some parts in Newfoundland. Wind gusts of 179\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph) were reported in Arisaig, Nova Scotia with a record high water height (before waves) of 2.73 meters (9.0\u00a0ft) in Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland.[98] At least 100 homes were damaged or destroyed in Newfoundland, primarily in Channel-Port aux Basques, with more than 200 people displaced.[99] Fiona left more than 500,000 customers without power, including 80% of all Nova Scotia customers and 95% of Prince Edward Island customers.[100][101] A Port aux Basques woman was killed when her home was destroyed and she was swept into the ocean; another person died of carbon monoxide poisoning while operating an electrical generator in Prince Edward Island.[102][103][104] Another man in Lower Prospect, Nova Scotia was swept out to sea and presumed dead.[45] Teacup Rock, a rock formation and local tourist attraction on the coast near Thunder Cove, Prince Edward Island, was destroyed after Hurricane Fiona struck.[105] Fiona also caused severe erosion to the province's dune system, particularly within Prince Edward Island National Park.[106] On September 25, Deputy Premier of Quebec Genevi\u00e8ve Guilbault flew to the Magdalen Islands to view the storm damage.[107] Insured losses from Fiona in Canada are estimated to be at least CA$800\u00a0million (US$590\u00a0million), with the total damage expected to be significantly higher.[108] This became the costliest weather event in Atlantic Canada history,[109] and the seventh-costliest nationwide (adjusted for inflation).[110]",
      "Aftermath": "",
      "Retirement": "Due to the severe damage and number of deaths the hurricane caused across the Caribbean and in eastern Canada, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Fiona from its rotating name lists in March 2023, and it will never be used again for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Farrah, which will first appear on the 2028 season list.[118][119]",

      "Hurricane Ike": "  Hurricane Ike (/a\u026ak/) was a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through portions of the Greater Antilles and Northern America in September\u00a02008, wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture, particularly in Cuba and Texas. Ike took a similar track to the 1900 Galveston hurricane. The ninth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Ike developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September\u00a01[nb 1] and strengthened to a peak intensity as a Category\u00a04\u00a0hurricane over the open waters of the central Atlantic on September\u00a04 as it tracked westward. Several fluctuations in strength occurred before Ike made landfall on eastern Cuba on September\u00a08. The hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the Gulf of Mexico, but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall in Galveston, Texas, on September\u00a013 before becoming an extratropical storm on September\u00a014. The remnants of Ike continued to track across the United States and into Canada, causing considerable damage inland, before dissipating on the next day.[1] Ike was blamed for at least 195 deaths. Of these deaths, 74 were in Haiti, which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms (Fay, Gustav, and Hanna) that had made landfall the same year. Seven people were killed in Cuba.[2] In the United States, 113 people were reported killed, directly or indirectly, and 16 were still missing as of August 2011.[1] Due to its immense size, Ike caused devastation from the Louisiana coastline all the way to the Kenedy County region near Corpus Christi, Texas.[3] In addition, Ike caused flooding and significant damage along the Mississippi coastline and the Florida Panhandle.[4] Damages from Ike in U.S. coastal and inland areas are estimated at $30\u00a0billion (2008\u00a0USD), with additional damage of $7.3\u00a0billion in Cuba, $200 million in the Bahamas, and $500\u00a0million in the Turks and Caicos, amounting to a total of at least $38\u00a0billion in damage. At the time, the hurricane was the second-costliest in United States history.[5] The search-and-rescue operation after Ike was the largest search-and-rescue operation in Texas history.[6]",
      "Meteorological history": "The origins of Hurricane Ike can be traced back to a well-defined tropical wave first identified by the National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) just within the western coast of Africa on August\u00a028.[7][8] Despite the development of a low-pressure area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the Cape Verde Islands,[9] the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity. The broad low-pressure continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01. By this time the cyclone had tracked 780 miles (1,260 kilometers) west of Cape Verde. Although post-analysis indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at 12:00\u00a0UTC that day,[10] operationally the NHC began issuing advisories on Ike three hours later, by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well-established outflow.[11] Over the next few hours, Ike developed additional rainbands,[12] but failed to develop a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the storm's south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface temperatures.[13] These factors were also responsible for Ike's slow developmental trend that began after formation.[10] Ike's gradual strengthening began to quicken early on September\u00a03, with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm. At roughly 15:00\u00a0UTC that day, microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical storm.[10] Tracking northwestward, the NHC upgraded Ike to hurricane status at 18:00\u00a0UTC based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite imagery.[10][14] During this time, Ike was centered 690\u00a0mi (1,110\u00a0km) east-northeast of the Leeward Islands and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its northeast.[10] Ike's placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north,[14] reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane.[15] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, Ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour (233 kilometers per hour) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 millibars (27.6 inches of mercury), making the storm a Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. After peaking in strength, a ridge of high pressure to the storm's west strengthened, causing Ike to track towards the southwest\u2014a path unusual for the time of year. However, this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear,[10] causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on September\u00a04 and weaken,[16] briefly dropping below major hurricane status on September\u00a06 while 150 miles (240\u00a0km) east of Grand Turk Island.[17] Although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification, Ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days. After passing near the Turks and Caicos Islands, Ike made its first landfall on Inagua in the Bahamas at 13:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07 with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[18] After passing over Inagua,[18] the development of a double eyewall\u2014a feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle\u2014slightly weakened Ike late on September\u00a07.[19] However, the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach Category\u00a04 intensity for a final time before making landfall near Cabo Lucrecia on the coast of Holgu\u00edn Province in Cuba by 00:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[18] Although Ike remained well-defined for most of its crossing of eastern Cuba,[20] the hurricane's core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the Caribbean Sea after spending a few hours over land.[21] Over the next day, Ike tracked westward, paralleling the southern coast of Cuba without much intensification; at times the center of the hurricane was within 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) of the island. At around 14:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09, Ike made a second Cuban landfall, this time on Punta La Capitana in Pinar del Rio, with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Roughly six hours later, the hurricane emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a slightly weakened system.[18] Despite tracking back over water, Ike's prolonged interaction with Cuba had greatly disrupted the system's core, and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing, the storm's wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued.[18] Due to the storm's comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands,[22] an eyewall replacement cycle took place, preventing Ike from rapidly intensifying. At around the same time, a high-pressure area strengthened to the hurricane's north, steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated. Moving over the warm waters of the Loop Current,[18] Ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00:00\u00a0UTC with an estimate of 944\u00a0mbar (27.9\u00a0inHg); though winds would continue to strengthen afterward, the storm's pressure would rise.[23] By late on September\u00a012, Ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high-pressure area and began to curve northward. The formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds,[18] and at 0700\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, Ike made landfall on the northeast end of Galveston Island in Texas, with a minimum barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg) and sustained winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), making Ike a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[23] After tracking inland, Ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward, weakening to tropical storm status east of Palestine, Texas late on September\u00a013 and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on September\u00a014 over the Ozarks.[18] A more steady weakening phase ensued, and after tracking across southern Ontario and Quebec, the remnants of Ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the St. Lawrence River, on September\u00a015.[24]",
      "Preparations": "",
      "Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas": "Due to the damage brought by Ike in the Turks and Caicos Islands, the insular government declared the islands of Grand Turk and South Caicos as disaster areas. Damage on the islands was surveyed immediately following the hurricane's passage by a CDERA assessment team from Jamaica. Following the occurrence of extensive power outages, the Caribbean Electric Utilities Services Cooperation offered to support the restoration of power services. The British HMS Iron Duke (F234) was sent to the islands to assist in recovery efforts, and personnel from the British Red Cross were also dispatched.[116]",
      "Florida": "On September 5, Florida Governor Charlie Crist declared a state of emergency in advance of Ike's arrival, (which was expected to be as early as September 8). Authorities in Key West issued a mandatory evacuation for all visitors for September 6. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) positioned supplies, and emergency response crews in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. Florida Keys officials began evacuations on the low-lying chain of islands in phases, starting at the end in Key West by 8\u00a0am Sunday and continuing throughout the day\u2014at noon for the Middle Keys, and at 4\u00a0pm for the Upper Keys, including Key Largo. Visitors were told to leave on Saturday.[27] Overall 15,000 tourists evacuated, but the storm stayed to the south, only causing minor beach erosion.[1]",
      "Texas": "On the morning of September 13, 2008, the eye of Hurricane Ike approached the upper Texas coast, making landfall at 2:10\u00a0am CDT over the east end of Galveston Island, with a high storm surge, and travelled north up Galveston Bay, along the east side of Houston\n[78]\n(see storm-path image).\nPeople in low-lying areas who had not heeded evacuation orders, in single-family one- or two-story homes, were warned by the weather service that they faced \"certain death\" from the overnight storm surge.[41] Nearly 16,000 families in the Galveston-Houston area stayed in temporary shelters under federal housing programs, while 1700 were referred for assistance but could not be reached or were refused aid. [citation needed] In regional Texas towns, electrical power began failing on September 12 before 8\u00a0pm CDT,[41]\nleaving millions without power (estimates range from 2.8\u00a0million[79] to 4.5\u00a0million[80] customers). Grocery store shelves in the Houston area were empty for weeks in the aftermath of the storm.[81] In Galveston, by 4\u00a0pm CDT (2100 UTC) on September 12, the rising storm surge began overtopping the 17\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) Galveston Seawall, which faces the Gulf of Mexico;[41] waves had been crashing along the seawall earlier, from 9\u00a0am CDT.[82]\nAlthough Seawall Boulevard is elevated above the shoreline, many areas of town slope down behind the seawall to the lower elevation of Galveston Island. Even though there were advance evacuation plans, Mary Jo Naschke, spokesperson for the city of Galveston, estimated that (as of Friday morning) a quarter of the city's residents paid no attention to calls for them to evacuate, despite predictions that most of Galveston Island would suffer heavy flooding from storm tide.[82]  By 6\u00a0pm Friday night estimates varied as to how many of the 58,000 residents remained, but the figures of remaining residents were in the thousands.[83]\nWidespread flooding included downtown Galveston:[78] six feet (1.8\u00a0m) deep inside the Galveston County Courthouse, and the University of Texas Medical Branch, the primary hospital in Galveston county, was dealt significant damage due to flooding. The wide-scale flooding caused failures to all the facilities systems and allowed mold to invade all the buildings.[84]  Tourist attractions on the island suffered various degrees of damage. The Lone Star Flight Museum suffered massive damage, as the storm surge washed through the airport and hangars with about 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) of water; however, Moody Gardens was built with storms in mind and was able to withstand the worst of the storm.[85] In Houston, windows also broke in downtown buildings, including the 75-story JP Morgan Chase Tower,[78] and Reliant Stadium lost part of its roof.[1] As a result of the high wind and eyewall that passed directly through the city, power outages were a major problem. Some residents were without electricity for over a month. Because the storm system moved rapidly and did not linger over Houston, flooding was not a major problem for most of the city, as it normally is in a storm event, as a result of the relatively flat topography.[78] On Bolivar Peninsula, Texas, dozens of people were rescued as flood waters exceeded 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) above sea level in advance of the hurricane. Many residents, some trapped by high water on the road at Rollover Pass and others elsewhere along Bolivar Peninsula were not rescued. The peninsula bore the brunt of Ike's right-front quadrant, historically the worst part of a hurricane, and experienced catastrophic damage with the worst being between Rollover Pass and Gilchrist, Texas \u2013 west of High Island.[86] Estimates of lost homes in the peninsula were around 80%.[87] The Southeast Texas communities of Bridge City on Sabine Lake and large areas of nearby Orange (80 miles or 130 kilometres from the center of landfall) were inundated by the storm surge which traveled as much as 16 miles (26\u00a0km) inland from the coast. Bridge City mayor Kirk Roccaforte estimated that only about 14 homes (later updated to around two dozen) in the city were unaffected by the surge.[88] Ike also caused widespread wind damage throughout southeast Texas, but was not bad due to Hurricane Rita striking the region in 2005 and Hurricane Humberto in 2007. NASA's Johnson Space Center  suffered minor roof damage to Mission Control and minor cosmetic damage to some of its other buildings. NASA's operations at Ellington Field also sustained roof and awning damage,[89] and one hangar was severely damaged.",
      "Impact": "",
      "Haiti": "The outer bands of Ike caused additional flooding in Haiti, which was already devastated by Hanna and also hit hard by Fay and Gustav. The last bridge still standing into the city of Gona\u00efves was washed away, slowing relief in the community considerably and creating a deep humanitarian and food crisis in the hard-hit region.[1][48] 74 deaths were reported in Haiti from Ike, most of which were in the coastal community of Cabaret which was swept away by floodwaters and mudslides.[1][49] Haitian Prime Minister Mich\u00e8le Pierre-Louis called for help at the end of the week, saying that four storms in three weeks have left over 550 dead and as many as one million homeless.[50]  She also said that parts of Gona\u00efves were so severely damaged that the city may have to be rebuilt elsewhere.[50] Two additional deaths were reported in the Dominican Republic.[1]",
      "Cuba": "About 2.6 million Cubans, a fourth of the population, were evacuated ahead of Ike.[59] In Baracoa, 200\u00a0homes were reported to be destroyed and waves were running 23\u00a0ft (7\u00a0m) high and peaked at 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) in different areas of Cuba. The Category\u00a04 hurricane made landfall on September 8 on the north coast of eastern Cuba in the province of Holgu\u00edn near Puerto de Sama, with sustained winds of about 130\u00a0mph (209\u00a0km/h),[1] causing widespread flooding and damage to the eastern provinces.[1] It passed across the central provinces of Holgu\u00edn, Las Tunas, and Camag\u00fcey, emerging over the sea to the south of Cuba during the day. Ike dropped to Category One intensity by the time it crossed the island.[60] It then followed the southern coast of Cuba and crossed the western end of the island in Pinar del R\u00edo Province, close to the path taken by Hurricane Gustav ten days previously. The western areas of Cuba, already devastated by just 10\u00a0days before Ike hit, suffered additional major flooding from the rain and storm surge.[2] The sugar cane crop was devastated, with over 3,400 square kilometres (1,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) destroyed. The banana, yucca, coffee, and corn crops also suffered significant damage.[1] Alongside Gustav, they were described as the \"worst ever\" storms by Cuban officials.[61] In total, seven people were killed in Cuba from Ike due to drowning or collapsing structures.[2][1] Over 300,000 houses were damaged, with an estimated 43,000 a total loss.[1] The combined damage estimate from Ike and Gustav, and succeeding Paloma is about $9.7\u00a0billion (USD), with $7.3 billion of that from Ike, making Ike the most destructive hurricane in Cuban history at the time. It was later surpassed by Hurricane Irma almost exactly nine years later.[62]",
      "United States": "Due to the intensity of the storm, Texas closed many of its chemical plants and oil refineries. Because much of the United States oil refining capacity is located in Texas, the closings caused a temporary increase in the prices of gasoline, home heating oil, and natural gas.[65] Increases were particularly high in North Carolina, especially in the mountains, where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average.[66] The closing of refineries so soon after Hurricane Gustav, and the time required to restart production, also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the Carolinas and Tennessee, partly as a result of panic buying.[67]  113 direct and indirect deaths have been reported in the US, including 85 in Texas (18 direct), eight in Louisiana, one in Arkansas, two in Tennessee, one in Kentucky, seven in Indiana, four in Missouri, two in Illinois, two in Michigan, seven in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania.[1] As of August 2011, 16 people remain unaccounted for, 11 of them in the Galveston area.[1] On September 15, 2008, the United States Congress held a moment of silence for those who died in the hurricane.",
      "MV Antalina": "On September 11, the MV Antalina, a 584-foot (178\u00a0m) cargo ship, was among the ships that left Port Arthur to avoid the hurricane. The ship had a crew of 22 and carried a cargo of petroleum coke. On September 12, the ship's engine failed, and the ship was adrift 90 nautical miles (170\u00a0km) from the shore. The crew unsuccessfully attempted to repair the engine and requested to be evacuated by the Coast Guard, but the rescue mission was aborted because weather conditions were not within the safety parameters. The crew was forced to ride out the storm but kept in contact with the Coast Guard.[68][69] The ship successfully rode out the storm and all 22 crew members were uninjured. On September 13, a tugboat was dispatched to return the vessel to port.[70]",
      "Louisiana": "Ike's storm surge affected Louisiana well ahead of the hurricane's landfall in Texas. Areas in coastal south-central and southwestern Louisiana, some of which were flooded by Gustav, were re-flooded as a result of Ike.[71] Some areas that had not yet recovered from Gustav power outages received additional outages.[72] The hardest-hit areas were in and around Cameron Parish, with nearly every square inch of the coastline in that area was flooded heavily, reaching as far north as Lake Charles, nearly 30 miles inland.[1] Hundreds of people had to be rescued,[73] including 363\u00a0people who were rescued by Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Search and Rescue teams in conjunction with the Louisiana National Guard and the U.S. Coast Guard.[74] One person was killed in a flooded bayou in Terrebonne Parish,[75] and a wind-related death was reported near Houma.[76] Two other deaths took place in a car crash in the evacuation phase in Iberville Parish,[77] and two other storm-related deaths in Jefferson Davis Parish that were ruled as deaths by natural causes.[76]",
      "Farther Inland": "On September 14, after Ike became extratropical and was enhanced by an upper-level shortwave trough, a major wind event took place across the lower and middle Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes, and significant rainfall and flooding took place to the west. The St. Louis Metropolitan Area experienced hurricane conditions, with Ike's remnants inflicting severe damage to homes. Several areas in Illinois and Indiana, already flooded by the frontal boundto the north, saw significant additional rainfall.[90] Due to flooding in Chicago, Todd Stroger declared a state of emergency for Cook County due to flooding of the Des Plaines River. Hurricane-force wind gusts were reported to the east of the centre across parts of Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania with significant wind damage including structural damage to buildings and trees. The Louisville area declared a state of emergency due to major damage and power outages, and the Louisville International Airport was closed temporarily. A LG&E spokesperson said that this was the worst power outage in 30\u00a0years.[91] Later in the day, a statewide state of emergency was declared in Kentucky by Governor Steve Beshear.[92] Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport was also temporarily shut down, and the control tower was evacuated. In Cincinnati, numerous reports of roof damage and uprooted trees were called in to law enforcement, and on September 15, most of the schools in Hamilton County, Butler County, and Warren County had classes canceled because of power outages, some of which lasted seven days. Wind gusts of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) were recorded in both Cincinnati and Columbus, which is equivalent to sustained wind levels found in a Category\u00a01 hurricane.[93]  Additionally, a state of emergency was declared in Ohio.[94] Damages in Ohio was originally estimated at $553 million with 131,000 insurance claims filed in the first few days following the storm.[95] The overall total damage in Ohio exceeded $1.1 billion, tying the 1974 Xenia tornado as the costliest storm in Ohio's history.[1]  Also in Salem, Indiana, and Scottsburg, Indiana, wind gusts up to 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) were recorded. In Indiana, high winds caused more than 200,000 customers to be without power throughout the state. Wind gusts of 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) were recorded at Indianapolis International Airport. Coming into Indianapolis, on September 14, Ike also caused disruptions to the first-ever motorcycle Grand Prix held in Indianapolis, stopping both the 125cc and MotoGP races after two-thirds of the race distance, and causing the cancellation of the 250cc race. In Arkansas, about 200,000 customers lost power as a result of the winds, the worst power loss in that state since an ice storm in 2000.[96] In the Louisville area, over 300,000 customers were without power\u00a0\u2014 the worst power outage in the utility's history.[91] The Cincinnati metropolitan area was hard hit as well, with over 927,000 customers losing power in that region. A Duke Energy spokesperson said \"We have never seen anything like this. Never. We're talking about 90 percent of our customers without power.\" There were so many power outages and so few workers available Duke Energy was thinking of sending workers from their base in Charlotte, North Carolina.[97] Many homes and business were without power for 3\u20137 days.  Cincinnati Public Schools cancelled classes for students for at least three days for all schools. In the Dayton, Ohio area 300,000 of 515,000 Dayton Power & Light Co. customers lost power at some point following severe wind storms on the afternoon of September 14, according to a company spokesperson.[98] Also hard hit were central Ohio (with over 350,000 customers losing power) and northeastern Ohio (with over 310,000 customers losing power),[99] as well as Illinois (49,000),[100] Missouri (85,000),[101] and western Pennsylvania (with over 180,000 customers losing power).[102] In western Kentucky, outside crews had to be brought in from as far away as Mississippi to restore power.[103] In Indiana, about 350,000 customers lost power statewide, mainly in the southern part of the state.[104] In New York State, over 100,000 customers were reported without power.[105] In total, 28 deaths have been blamed on Ike in the inland states.[1]",
      "Canada": "In Ontario, Ike's remnants brought a record amount of rain on Sunday, September 14, in the Windsor region. It was closely following a slow-moving frontal system that had drenched the city the day before, dumping 75.2 millimeters (2.96 inches) of rain and breaking the old record of 39.1\u00a0mm (1.54\u00a0in) in 1979, according to Environment Canada. Most damage in the Windsor area with Ike was confined to downed power lines and toppled tree branches with the wind gusts reaching 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), with spotty street flooding that made driving completely treacherous in some areas.[106] Highways were washed out in the Bruce Peninsula, and trees were uprooted in London, Ontario. The storm continued to cause wind and rain damage as it continued east along the St. Lawrence River leaving around 25,000 customers without electricity, especially in Belleville, Brockville, Bancroft, Peterborough, Bowmanville, Huntsville, and Timmins.[107] In Quebec, regions to the north of the Saint Lawrence River received 50 to 70\u00a0mm (2.0 to 2.8\u00a0in) of rainfall (Hautes-Laurentides, Haute-Mauricie, R\u00e9serve faunique des Laurentides, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Charlevoix and C\u00f4te-Nord). Maximum rainfall was recorded between Lac-St-Jean and the R\u00e9serve faunique des Laurentides with a station recording more than 90\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in) of rain[108] Along the river, the amount were more in the 10 and 30\u00a0mm (0.4 and 1.2\u00a0in) range, except in Quebec City area which received almost 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in), most of it between 7:00\u00a0pm and 8:00\u00a0pm.[108] This rain caused small inundations, storm drain overflows, and closed one major highway.[109] In Montreal, high humidity levels pushed by the system caused electrical malfunction one of the lines of the subway, stranding over 25,000 commuters.[110] High winds up to 78\u00a0km/h (48\u00a0mph) caused, at their worst, over 25,000 households to lose electricity in Montreal, Laval, Estrie and Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie[111] and when it reached the Magdalen Islands, it had enough strength to cause a sailboat, the Oc\u00e9an, to sink. Its six passengers were rescued by a helicopter of the Canadian Coast Guard.[108][111] The \"Ike Spike\" in gasoline prices was quite severe in Canada, with gas prices rising anywhere from 15 to 20 cents per liter.[112]",
      "Iceland": "Ike's remnants combined with an unusual depression that affected southwestern Iceland on September 17, three days after Ike became extratropical.[113] The storm produced 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) waves along southwest coasts of the island. Rainfall peaked near 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) close to Reykjav\u00edk. Wind gusts were measured up to 89\u00a0mph (143\u00a0km/h).[114] Strong winds on the backside of the system produced a large dust storm in northern areas of the island.[115]",
      "Aftermath": "",
      "Criticism of aid": "After Hurricane Ike, many residents applied to FEMA for loans and FEMA trailers. Many residents were forced to wait several weeks until their trailers arrived. Some waited for up to two months, living in hotels, in homes of relatives several miles away, or in their homes, with no power or running water. Many residents were angry at the response that FEMA gave to the problem. Texas state leaders also accused FEMA of foot dragging and insensitivity.[117] $3.1 billion in federal aid was eventually allocated to Texas by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It was supposed to be used to repair single-family homes of lower and middle-class income families, but as of 2011 only 10% of those funds were released, while the rest were held up because of \"state bureaucracy\".[118]",
      "Public and mental health issues": "Hurricane Ike also brought many health issues to the victims. Damages from the homes and the environment helped create these issues amongst the public. Following the disaster, communities were challenged to provide the correct medical treatment in emergency rooms and other medical facilities. It developed stress restricting victims their basic health services. Orange County had an 88.5 percent capacity loss of intermediate care facilities reducing its overall capacity. By late October five hospitals that usually served the areas that were impacted by the hurricane stayed closed while only one hospital continued to operate but with a limit of patients.[119] The need for mental health services increased after the disaster especially for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Most individuals will not progress to constant behavioral or mental health problems, but the World Health Organization estimates between five and ten percent of victims will have more long-term issues.[119] Telephone interviews and mental health diagnoses were ordered randomly to households concerning the effects of Hurricane Ike. Post-disaster mental health occurrences were 5.9 percent for post-traumatic stress disorder, 4.5 percent for major depressive episode, and 9.9 percent for general anxiety disorder.[120] A Galveston Bay Recovery Study (GBRS) was a survey distributed through a random stratified cluster sampling of victims in the Galveston Bay area for research on traumatic stress and disaster exposure. When surveyed victims were asked how they felt and what they experienced after the hurricane there was an immediate emotional response to fear of the loss of property, employment, displacement, and damages.[121] Children were targeted for physical abuse by parents and guardians because of loss of property and employment.[119] Results of post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, dysfunctions, and disabilities were reported when asked how stressful their lives have been since Hurricane Ike.[121] There was an increase of impairments, interference with social activities and health behaviors such as eating poorly, smoking more, and restlessness.[121] Development of these mental health problems was due to the lack of sufficient clean clothing, electricity, food, money, transportation, or water for at least one week. Victims and workers face numerous residential and occupational hazards during the process of repairing their homes or community. An exposure to hazardous materials through the process created health threats of diseases, air contamination, smoke inhalation, and lead poisoning. As disaster victims return to their damaged homes children were exposed to the debris and other hazards, developing a risk of injury.[119] After the hurricane because of power outages individuals and family misused portable generators causing carbon monoxide poisoning. Eighty-two percent to 87 percent of carbon monoxide were caused by the improper use of generators. The Texas Department of State Health Services issued that gasoline generators should not be used indoors.[122] Fifty-four people were reported by the Texas poison centers to have storm-related carbon monoxide exposure. The Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society and The Center for Disease Control reported 15 people had to undergo hyperbaric oxygen treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning.[122][123] Symptoms from exposure were headaches, nausea, and vomiting with the majority of the treated cases under the age of eighteen.[123][124]",
      "Sports": "Hurricane Ike forced the Houston Astros and the Chicago Cubs to play out their 3-game set in Milwaukee at Miller Park.[125]  Ike also forced the postponement of the second-week NFL game between the Houston Texans and the Baltimore Ravens. The game was later made up in Houston after repairs were made to Reliant Stadium on November 9, 2008. It also forced the NCAA football game on September 13 between the Houston Cougars and the Air Force Falcons to be moved from Robertson Stadium in Houston to Gerald Ford Stadium in Dallas.[126] Ike also forced the postponement of a Texas Longhorns game in Austin,[127] Texas due to increased evacuee traffic in the city's shelters. The Sam Houston Bearkats football game with Prairie View A&M was also canceled. Tickets for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) WrestleMania XXV were originally scheduled to go on sale September 20, 2008, but it was postponed due to the effect of Ike on the state of Texas until November 8, 2008.[128][129]",
      "Relief efforts": "There were a number of relief efforts set up to help those caught up in Ike, including one set up by Portlight and Weather Underground. Most of them raised at least $10,000 to help out.[130] The Portlight/Weather Underground effort created some initial controversy springing from the unexpected overwhelming response to requests for assistance. Portlight delivered over $500,000 worth of equipment to people with disabilities and outlying communities that were impacted by Hurricane Ike. They also delivered pizza to the residents of the hard-hit Bolivar peninsula and helped provide a Christmas party for residents of Bridge City, Texas.[131][132] Direct Relief, an emergency response organization, provided over $1.1 million in hurricane emergency aid as of September 20, 2008. The organization sent shipments that contained medicines, and hygienic supplies.[133][134]",
      "Oil and gas spills": "Hurricane Ike's winds, surge, and giant waves tossed storage tanks and punctured pipelines. However, operators in the Gulf of Mexico (ranging from major integrated producers like BP and Shell to small privately owned independents) shut in operations in advance of Ike's approach as a precautionary measure. As a result of these shut-ins, US oil production dropped from 5 million barrels per day (790,000 cubic meters per day) to 4\u00a0Mbbl/d (640,000\u00a0m3/d) in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane. By late November, production was restored to pre-Ike levels. Despite the hurricane, only 500,000 U.S. gallons (1,900 cubic meters) of crude oil split into the Gulf of Mexico and the marshes, bayous and bays of Louisiana and Texas over a coastline distance of 185 miles (298 kilometres). Much of the spillage occurred in the High Island area of Galveston County, Texas, where storm surge rose over a low-lying oilfield and flooded the marshy area around several producing wells, beam pumps and storage tanks. During the days both before and after the storm, companies, and residents reported around 448 releases of gas, oil and other substances into the environment in Louisiana and Texas. The hardest hit places were industrial centres near Houston and Port Arthur, Texas, as well as oil production facilities off Louisiana's coast.[135] The Coast Guard, with the Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies, has responded to more than 3,000 pollution reports associated with the storm and its surge along the upper Texas coast. Most callers complain about abandoned propane tanks, paint cans and other hazardous materials containers turning up in marshes, backyards, and other places.[136]",
      "Collision of oil tanker with drilling rig": "On March 6, 2009, a 159,000-ton Norwegian tanker, SKS Satilla, collided with jackup drilling rig Ensco 74, operated by Ensco (now Valaris Limited), which had been missing after Ike struck.[137] The tanker's double hull prevented an oil spill at the site, 65 miles south of Galveston, which is 115 miles west of the original position of the rig.[138] Four drilling rigs, including Ensco 74, were damaged by Ike, but Ensco 74 was the only missing rig. At least 52 oil platforms were damaged by Ike.[139]",
      "Retirement": "Because of the tremendous damage and number of deaths caused by storm, the name Ike was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in April 2009, and will never be used again for an Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Isaias for the 2014 season.[140][141]",
      "Future mitigation": "A commission was established by Rick Perry, the Texas Governor, following the hurricane to investigate preparing for and mitigating future disasters. A proposal has been put forth to build an \"Ike Dike\", a massive levee system which would protect the Galveston Bay, and the important industrial facilities which line the coast and the ship channel, from a future, potentially more destructive storm. The proposal has gained widespread support from a variety of business interests. As of 2009[update], it is currently only at the conceptual stage.[142]",

      "1933 Trinidad hurricane": " The 1933 Trinidad hurricane was the third-farthest-east tropical storm to form in the Main Development Region (MDR) so early in the calendar year on record and was one of three North Atlantic tropical cyclones on record to produce hurricane-force winds in Venezuela. The second tropical storm and first hurricane of the extremely active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, the system formed on June 24 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It moved westward and attained hurricane status before striking Trinidad on June 27. The storm caused heavy damage on the island, estimated at $3\u00a0million.[nb 1] The strong winds downed trees and destroyed hundreds of houses, leaving about 1,000\u00a0people homeless. Later, the hurricane crossed the northeastern portion of Venezuela, where power outages and damaged houses were reported. After entering the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane maintained a northwest trajectory. It passed south of Jamaica on July 1, where heavy rainfall flooded roads and railways. The hurricane crossed western Cuba on July 3. High winds on the island destroyed hundreds of houses, and the storm's rainfall damaged the tobacco crop. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane turned to the west and attained peak winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) on July 5. It struck northeastern Mexico on July 8 and quickly dissipated. Upon its final landfall, the storm caused heavy damage in Mexico, and in southern Texas the storm ended a prolonged drought.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave[nb 2] was first observed near 40\u00b0\u00a0W on June 23. The next day, a ship in the region observed a closed circulation, suggesting that the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression about 1,300\u00a0mi (2,100\u00a0km) east of Trinidad. The storm moved westward and gradually intensified, at the time becoming a tropical storm farther east in the MDR at an earlier date than any other system before in the calendar year;[2] this distinction was later met by Tropical Storm Bret in 2023.[3] By June 27, it attained hurricane status about 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) east of Trinidad, based on a ship report of a barometric pressure of 991\u00a0mbar (29.27\u00a0inHg); it was the first of 11\u00a0hurricanes during the season. At around 2100\u00a0UTC on June 27, the hurricane made landfall on extreme southern Trinidad with winds of about 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h).[nb 3] After crossing the island, the hurricane struck the Paria Peninsula of northern Venezuela at the same intensity at 0200\u00a0UTC on June 28.[4] The 1933 Monthly Weather Review summary of the season noted that the hurricane was the \"earliest known in [the] general area also the only one in a record of nearly 50\u00a0years to pass south of the Island of Trinidad and over the northeast corner of Venezuela.\"[5] About two hours after striking Venezuela, the hurricane entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea. For the next few days it maintained its intensity while tracking to the northwest. A ship on June 30 reported a pressure of 982\u00a0mb (29.0\u00a0inHg), suggesting winds of about 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The next day, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica and turned more to the west before resuming a northwest motion. At around 0600\u00a0UTC on July 3, the hurricane made landfall on western Cuba with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). It weakened while crossing the island, although it maintained hurricane status upon entering the Gulf of Mexico.[4] On July 4, a strong high pressure area over the eastern United States turned the hurricane to the west.[5] After restrengthening, the storm attained peak winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) on July 5, based on a ship report of a pressure of 965\u00a0mbar (28.5\u00a0inHg). It maintained that intensity for about 18\u00a0hours, and during that time the hurricane turned to the southwest. At 0100\u00a0UTC on July 8, the hurricane made its final landfall near La Pesca,[4] about halfway between Tampico, Tamaulipas and Brownsville, Texas.[5] The intensity at landfall was estimated at 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h). After moving ashore, the hurricane rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern Mexico, and the storm dissipated at around 1200\u00a0UTC on July 8.[4][failed verification]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Throughout its path, the hurricane killed at least 35\u00a0people altogether in Trinidad, Venezuela, Jamaica, and Cuba.[6] The hurricane first affected Trinidad, causing about $3\u00a0million in damage in the southern portion of the island.[5] The storm destroyed 300\u00a0houses in one village, and thousands were left homeless.[7] Trees across the island fell down and blocked many roads, including one that struck a car and seriously injured one man. Heavy damage was also reported to the cocoa industry.[8] High winds destroyed about 60\u00a0oil derricks, and an 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) oil supply line was disrupted due to fallen trees.[7] This represented a significant loss to the island's oil industry, one of two such events in the 1930s.[9] High winds downed power lines across the island, which were repaired by three days after the storm struck.[10] The storm also dropped heavy rainfall and destroyed the roofs of many houses.[11] Little damage occurred in the capital city of Port of Spain.[8] There were 13\u00a0deaths in Trinidad,[5] some of whom drowned after their boats sank.[10] After the storm, medical assistance and relief supplies were sent via boat to Cedros, which was one of the most significantly affected areas.[12] After affecting Trinidad, the hurricane struck northeastern Venezuela, where damage was heaviest in Car\u00fapano, R\u00edo Caribe, and Isla Margarita. High winds cut telephone and telegraph lines for several days. The storm destroyed several houses and fishing boats, resulting in several million bol\u00edvares in damage.[nb 4] Officials reported that there were \"a number of lives lost\" due to the hurricane.[5] Striking with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h),[4] the storm was one of only three Atlantic tropical cyclones on record at the time to affect the country with hurricane-force winds as of 2015, after hurricanes in 1877 and 1892.[13] After moving across the Caribbean, the hurricane affected Jamaica. High winds downed about 200,000\u00a0banana trees, while flooding in the western portion of the island affected roads and railways.[14] Later, the hurricane crossed western Cuba,[5] killing 22\u00a0people and causing $4\u00a0million in damage.[15] The hurricane destroyed about 100\u00a0houses in Pinar del R\u00edo Province from the combination of strong winds and flooding from heavy rainfall. One person died after her house collapsed in the province.[16] The rainfall caused four rivers to exceed their banks, and the storm-related flooding left serious damage to the tobacco industry.[14] The storm also damaged crops in the region. High winds downed telephone and telegraph lines in western Cuba. Little damage was reported in the capital city of Havana, despite the report of a peak wind gust of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). After the storm, Cuban President Gerardo Machado utilized the military to assist in relief operations and prevent looting.[16] The threat of the storm prompted the United States Weather Bureau to issue southeast storm warnings for Key West, Florida. Light rainfall from the storm was reported in Miami.[16] Before the storm made its final landfall, the Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, Texas on July 5. That same day, a hurricane warning was also issued for Brownsville. The hurricane ultimately struck a sparsely-populated area of northeastern Mexico, causing several deaths and heavy damage in the country.[5] High winds downed trees and power lines, and damaged the roofs of several houses. Along the beach near Tampico, high tides damaged coastal structures and flooded some cars.[17] The effects extended into Texas, and Brazos Island, Port Isabel, and Port Aransas were flooded due to the storm surge.[18] High tides damaged ten piers in Port Isabel, and there was damage to buildings along the coast. The storm damaged the cotton and fruit crops in south Texas from high winds and rainfall.[17] Rains from the storm ended an extended drought in the Brownsville area.[19]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Tropical Storm Etau (2009)": "Tropical Storm Etau was the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004. Forming on August\u00a08, 2009 from an area of low pressure, the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking in a curved path around the edge of a subtropical ridge, Etau continued to intensify as it neared Japan. By August\u00a010, the cyclone reached its peak intensity as a weak tropical storm with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992\u00a0hPa (mbar). Shortly after, Etau began to weaken. Increasing wind shear led to the center becoming devoid of convection and the system eventually weakened to a tropical depression on August\u00a013. The remnants of Etau persisted for nearly three days before dissipating early on August\u00a016. Although Etau did not make landfall, the outer bands of the storm produced torrential rainfall in Japan, peaking at 326.5\u00a0mm (12.85\u00a0in). These rains triggered deadly flooding and mudslides, especially in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. Twenty-eight people were killed by the storm and \u00a57.1\u00a0billion (US$87.5\u00a0million) in damage occurred throughout the affected region.[1][2] According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, a total of 5,602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed. Following the storm, 600 Japanese soldiers were deployed from Tokyo to assist in cleanup efforts.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Tropical Storm Etau originated on August\u00a05 out of an area of low pressure associated with disorganized convective activity located about 550\u00a0km (280\u00a0mi) east-northeast of Guam.[3] The following day, the system relocated several dozen kilometers to the north. Convective turning began to appear on satellite imagery and a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell to the north provided a northward component to the system's movement.[4] Early on August\u00a07, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the developing system as deep convection consolidated around the low-pressure system.[5] Around 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression.[6] Several hours later on August\u00a08, the JTWC also declared the system a tropical depression, classifying it at 10W.[7] Later that day, convection associated with the depression became disorganized, preventing intensification of the system. The depression generally tracked towards the northwest during the day in response a subtropical ridge to the north.[8] By August\u00a09, the center of circulation became more defined as convection wrapped around it.[9] Around 1200\u00a0UTC, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Etau.[10] The JTWC, however, did not upgrade the system to a tropical storm for several more hours.[11] On August\u00a010, the JTWC briefly downgraded the storm to a tropical depression.[12] By this time, the system had re-curved to the east around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Etau also became slightly disorganized as it began to interact with the baroclinic zone near Japan.[13] Early on August\u00a011, the JMA reported that the storm winds had peaked at 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 992\u00a0hPa (mbar).[14] Later that day, the storm once more became slightly disorganized due to increased wind shear; however, the JTWC reported that the storm intensified based on satellite intensity estimates and weather radar imagery from Japan.[15] Later on August 11, the center of Etau became partially devoid of convection, with only a narrow band of shower and thunderstorm activity persisting to the southeast of the center.[16] Increasing wind shear prevented convection from redeveloping and the storm continued to weaken.[17] Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well to the east of Japan.[18] Roughly 24\u00a0hours later, the JMA also downgraded the system to a tropical depression.[19] The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August\u00a014 as it slowly tracked northward.[20]",
      "Preparations, impact and aftermath[edit]": "In anticipation of wind gusts up to 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) and heavy rains, Japanese officials evacuated roughly 47,000 residents from western regions along the coast as gale warnings were declared by the JMA. Officials also feared that flooding from Tropical Storm Etau would mirror that of Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan where at least 14 were killed in the country's worst flood in 50 years.[21][22] Six flights in the country were canceled after a plane was struck by lightning. Fifteen railway services were also canceled due to heavy rains.[23] According to officials in Japan, nearly 140,000 people were evacuated to shelters in relation to flooding and landslides produced by Etau.[1] As Tropical Storm Etau brushed Japan on August\u00a010, torrential rains fell within its outer bands. In a 24\u2011hour span, a record 326.5\u00a0mm (12.85\u00a0in) of rain fell, triggering extensive flooding and landslides.[24] Initial reports stated that 13 people were killed and 10 others were missing due to the storm.[25] Most of the fatalities took place in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture where hundreds of homes were flooded and numerous others were damaged or destroyed by landslides.[26] In some areas, flood waters reached a depth of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft).[24] One man drowned after driving his car into a flooded street and being overcome by the water.[27] Another person was killed after her home was destroyed by a landslide in Okayama prefecture.[28] In Tokushima, two people were listed as missing and two others sustained serious injuries.[23] Later news reports stated that up to 18 people were missing following further landslides. The affected region was especially susceptible to landslides due to recent seismic activity, with a magnitude 6.4 earthquake taking place on August\u00a010.[29] By August\u00a011, one of the missing persons was confirmed to have been killed during the storm. About 800 people were placed in public shelters and 53,000 homes were left without running water. By August\u00a012, a total of 18 people were confirmed to have been killed and nine others were still missing.[30] Three bridges in Tokushima were also washed away.[31] Days later, the Japanese Fire and Disaster Management Agency finalized the death toll at 26 with one other missing,[1][2] making Etau the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact Hy\u014dgo Prefecture, Japan since Typhoon Tokage in 2004.[32] Throughout several prefectures, 5,602 homes were flooded and 183 were destroyed. Landslides triggered by the storm damaged another 2,109 structures, most of which were in Okayama and Hy\u014dgo prefectures.[1] Following severe damages, in the town of Sayo it requested assistance from the national government. As a result, more than 200 troops were deployed to the town.[23][24]  A post-disaster office was also set up by the prime minister's office crisis management center.[24] An additional 400 troops were deployed to the city by August\u00a011 to assist in rescue efforts.[31]",

      "1945 Outer Banks hurricane": "The 1945 Outer Banks hurricane was a moderate hurricane that struck Florida and affected the East Coast of the United States in late June, 1945. The first tropical storm and the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, it developed on June 20 in the western Caribbean Sea off Honduras. For the next two days, it moved generally northward into the Gulf of Mexico. Reaching hurricane intensity on June 23, it then turned northeast toward the Florida peninsula. It made landfall in the Big Bend on June 24, then weakened to a tropical storm over land. Minor damage was reported in Florida, but the storm produced heavy, though beneficial, rains that eased one of the state's worst recorded droughts. Upon entering the Atlantic Ocean, it re-intensified into a hurricane and paralleled the East Coast. On June 26, it struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a minimal hurricane, producing minor damage but heavy rainfall. Continuing northeast, the cyclone delivered gale-force winds to New York and southern New England, causing traffic accidents and minor wind damage. Heavy rains drenched the area, and high waves offshore caused ships to need rescue. One man died in a traffic accident; some people were rescued on Long Island Sound. Peak winds on land were 66 miles per hour (106\u00a0km/h) at Nantucket, forcing ships to remain in port. The U.S. Coast Guard sought to escort ships at sea into safe harbor. Overall, the impact of the storm was minor, though temperatures fell almost 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) the day after the storm.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On June 19, a tropical disturbance was detected between Swan Island and the Honduran coast. However, surface data in the vicinity did not indicate a closed circulation until 12 UTC on June 20.[1] At 14 UTC that day, an Air Force reconnaissance plane located near 24\u00b0N 84\u00b0W reported gale-force winds of 35 knots (18\u00a0m/s) (40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h)).[1] At the time, this was taken to indicate that a tropical storm had formed about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) northwest of Swan Island.[2] Reanalysis by the Hurricane Research Division in 2013, however, determined that a tropical storm formed farther northwest, near 19\u00b0N 86\u00b0W.[3] Squally weather, and winds of moderate tropical storm force, was reported in connection with the tropical storm as it moved generally northward, toward the Yucat\u00e1n Channel.[2] Little strengthening occurred over the next two days, until after 12 UTC on June 22.[3] At that time, a period of rapid deepening commenced: within 24 hours, the cyclone increased its winds from 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) to 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). At the same time, its track made a sharp bend toward the northeast, threatening the Florida peninsula. While no central pressure was recorded, Hurricane Hunter aircraft flew into the storm on June 23 and reported winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) at 2015 UTC.[1] As with most early reconnaissance data, such readings are suspect; however, based upon the reconnaissance measurement, the storm was originally listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a Category 3 hurricane. Later, reanalysis lowered this estimate to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), equal to Category 2 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, due primarily to the absence of corroboration.[1] After peaking late on June 23, the storm quickly lost intensity.[2] The hurricane continued northeast and made landfall at 08 UTC on June 24, north of the Tampa Bay Area.[4] Although observations were sparse near the eye, the system was estimated to have had winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h), though only minor impacts were reported as few people lived in the landfall area.[1] After making landfall, the center tracked inland between Brooksville and Dunnellon, near the Hernando\u2013Citrus county line.[5] About an hour before 18 UTC, the cyclone returned to water off the Atlantic coast of Florida, passing between St. Augustine and Daytona Beach. Due to interaction with land, maximum sustained winds by then had decreased to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[3] After moving offshore, however, the cyclone quickly regained force. Within seven hours, it re-intensified into a minimal hurricane and paralleled the Southeastern United States, following the warm Gulf Stream. Early on June 26, the northeast-moving hurricane approached the North Carolina coast, and made a second landfall at 01 UTC near Beaufort, North Carolina. Passing very near to Cape Hatteras,[2] the eye of the storm moved offshore at Oregon Inlet, near Wanchese. The storm maintained hurricane intensity as it moved over and northeast of the Outer Banks.[5] At 06 UTC on June 27, the cyclone finally lost tropical characteristics, but still retained winds of hurricane force for another 12 hours.[3] Continuing to the northeast, the extratropical low passed south of Nova Scotia and hit Miquelon, Miquelon-Langlade, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). The system survived another four days, only to lose its identity near Iceland at 12 UTC on July 4.",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "As early as June 19, the U.S. Weather Bureau began sending reconnaissance missions to monitor the developing storm in the Caribbean. The regular reports sent by the airplanes provided valuable data about the intensity of the small cyclone.[6]  At 16 UTC (10:00\u00a0a.m. local time) on June 23, the U.S. Weather Bureau in New Orleans advised residents from Mobile, Alabama, to Cedar Key, Florida, to prepare for gale-force winds. Areas from Tampa to Grand Isle, Louisiana, were placed under a storm warning. The center of the storm was expected to strike land early on June 24 between Mobile and Panama City, Florida.[7]  As the storm intensified into a hurricane, forecasters shifted their predicted landfall point eastward; early on June 24 the Weather Bureau expected the storm to strike between Tampa and Cross City, Florida. Hurricane warnings were issued for the coastline between Tampa and Carrabelle, Florida; meanwhile, storm warnings were issued from Punta Gorda to Titusville. The city of Tallahassee prepared to receive evacuees, and evacuations were ordered for coastal communities in the Big Bend. The Florida Highway Patrol warned local residents to leave the area, and soldiers were transported out of Carrabelle.[8] As the hurricane moved closer to the Big Bend, storm warnings were extended up the Eastern Seaboard to Savannah, Georgia. Between 300 and 400 military aircraft were flown out of Florida to Birmingham, Alabama.[6] Once the storm left Florida, additional evacuations commenced between Georgetown, South Carolina, and Cape Hatteras,[9] including the North Carolina communities of Wilmington, Morehead City, and nearby resort towns.[10] Large-scale evacuations from the Wilmington area alone involved 5,000 people and were credited with reducing loss of life.[5] Meanwhile, storm warnings were extended northward to Norfolk, Virginia;[9] however, only minor impacts occurred in Carolinas[10] and Virginia.[11]  Nevertheless, the cyclone continued to parallel the East Coast, so storm warnings were eventually extended to Atlantic City, New Jersey; small watercraft in the Northeastern United States were advised to stay in port.[10] Winds in the Tampa Bay Area reached tropical storm force, 39\u201346\u00a0mph (63\u201374\u00a0km/h), at 05 UTC on June 24. At that time, the \"center\" of the storm was estimated to be 25\u00a0mi (40\u00a0km) across.[6] Near the point of landfall, the hurricane defoliated citrus trees and downed power lines, and flash floods washed out roadways.[12] Throughout its path, the hurricane generated prolific rains. Peak rainfall along the path totaled 13.6\u00a0in (350\u00a0mm) at Lake Alfred;[13] West Palm Beach recorded 11.4 inches (290\u00a0mm) of rain within a 24-hour period.[14] Rainfall in Orange County exceeded 6\u00a0in (152\u00a0mm), which proved beneficial to dry orange groves;[12] the heavy rains ended one of the worst droughts in Florida's history.[2]  Overall, damage in the Miami area was described as being slight, totaling $75,000 (1945 USD).[5] The hurricane also produced two tornadoes in Florida, one near LaBelle and another near Melbourne.[5] Along the Georgia coast, the hurricane produced only fringe impacts, including strong winds and heavy rain. Wind gusts to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) were reported from Tybee Island,[9] and portions of coastal North Carolina received up to 8.24\u00a0in (209\u00a0mm) of rain.[15] In New York and New England, the outer bands of the hurricane produced gale-force winds and high surf;  peak winds were reported at up to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on Long Island Sound, and large waves caused some boats to capsize and people to need rescue.[16] Offshore, even higher velocities were reported: a weather station on Nantucket, Massachusetts, measured a peak wind of 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h), and in the Atlantic Ocean winds reaching 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) battered Coast Guard vessels. The Coast Guard nevertheless sought to escort troubled ships into port. Heavy rainfall fell across coastal New England, peaking at 4.59\u00a0in (120\u00a0mm) on Nantucket. The heavy rains and gale-force winds hindered normal traffic; a vehicle struck and killed a man at Warwick, Rhode Island. At least 10,000 telephone lines were taken out of service, 7,000 of them in the Cape Cod region. Besides causing power outages, the stormy conditions damaged trees, buildings, and crops; in the Boston area, high winds knocked down trees and chimneys.[16] A strong temperature gradient existed between the cyclone and the Northeast U.S.: in New York City, the daily high on June 26 was almost 20\u00b0 F lower than on the preceding day.[17]",

      "Typhoon Talim (2017)": "Typhoon Talim, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lannie, was an intense and destructive tropical cyclone that affected parts of East Asia, especially Japan, during September 2017. The eighteenth named storm and the sixth typhoon of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, Talim's origins can be traced back to an area of low-pressure that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center first monitored on September 6. The disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency only two days later, and it became a tropical storm on September 9, earning the name Talim. Talim grew stronger over the next few days, eventually becoming a typhoon the next day. Within a favorable environment, the typhoon rapidly intensified after passing through the Ryukyu Islands. However, as it moved eastward, Talim started to weaken due to wind shear, and on September 16, it was downgraded to a tropical storm. The storm passed over Japan, near Kyushu the next day, before becoming extratropical on September 18. The extratropical remnants were last noted by the JMA four days later, before dissipating fully on September 22. In preparations for the typhoon, more than a half a million individuals evacuated in the Japanese islands, and tropical cyclone alerts were raised in the country itself, Taiwan and the eastern portion of China. The NDRRMC in the Philippines also issued bulletins on the system, depicting a possibility of flash floods and landslides in Luzon; however, the typhoon passed safely to the east of the country. 5 deaths were attributed from Talim, all in Japan and caused over $750 million worth of damages over the country.[1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On September 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a low pressure area for potential tropical cyclogenesis, under a favorable environment.[2] Two days later, on September 8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) confirmed the formation of a tropical depression to the southeast of the Mariana Islands.[3][2][4] A ridge steered the depression to the northwest to more favorable conditions, including low wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures and good outflow.[3] On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit, recognizing it as a tropical depression in their first bulletin.[5] The depression continued intensifying, becoming a tropical storm, early the next day, according to the JMA, and gave the name Talim on the system.[6][7][8] The JTWC followed upgrading the system on the afternoon hours of the same day.[6] The next day, it strengthened further to a severe tropical storm in the Philippine Sea.[9] In the early morning hours of September 10, the JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon, with a small eye emerging on the system.[10] Its eye became apparent on satellite images later that day,[11] before Talim entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, with the PAGASA issuing on their first bulletin, classifying the system as Typhoon Lannie.[12][13] It passed over the Ryukyu Islands on September 13 as it continued to move to the northwest.[14] Also at that time, Lannie exited the PAR, with the PAGASA issuing their final advisory on the system.[15][16] Talim reached its peak strength the next day, with sustained winds of about 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) for one minute mean and a minimum pressure of 935 mbar (27.61 inHg).[17] At this time, the typhoon's wind field expanded as far as Shanghai and it featured a large eye.[11]  On September 15, Talim began to weaken due to increasing upper-level wind shear, with the typhoon becoming slowly disorganized.[18][19] It further degraded to a tropical storm as it slowly approached the Japanese Islands, before making landfall near Kyushu on September 17.[20][21] It crossed the country, before transitioning to an extratropical storm as it entered the Sea of Japan, near Hokkaido on the next day,[22] following with the JTWC and JMA issuing their final warning.[3] It soon hit Sakhalin as a gale-force extratropical storm later that day.[22] The extratropical remnants persisted for four more days before dissipating on September 22, just offshore Magadan Oblast.[3]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "As Talim entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, the PAGASA issued their subsequent bulletins, pinpointing the possibility of the typhoon inducing the southwest monsoon. This may increase risks of flash floods and landslides; however, Talim passed safely to the northeast of the country.[12][15]",
      "East China and Taiwan[edit]": "Starting on September 13, rough surfs started to impact Taiwan.[44] As the typhoon slowly approached, heavy rain warnings were issued on the northeastern part of the country.[45] Forecasts depicted the possibility of Talim making landfall near Taipei; however, Talim passed to the east of the country. Despite that, rainshowers impacted the northeastern part of the island.[46] Also at that time, lightning was detected on the typhoon at its peak intensity.[47] Storm surges began to impact the eastern coast of Zhejiang on September 14.[23] As Talim neared, squally rainfall and gusty winds were experienced at the area.[48] However, some residents watch the big waves at the shore in awe.[23][49][50] Fortunately, no damages and deaths were reported at these areas.[citation needed]",
      "Ryukyu Islands and Japan[edit]": "The US Navy began issuing Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness alerts for all US bases in Okinawa on September 12.[21] As Talim passes through, high waves are expected across the whole Ryukyu Islands.[35][36] More than 640,000 individuals were ordered to evacuate across southern Japan ahead of the typhoon.[37][36][38] Over 644 domestic flights were cancelled and other international flights were moved to other days, making the tourists stranded.[39] Some games were also cancelled and/or moved to other dates due to Talim.[40][41] Warnings were issued at all households regarding the approaching typhoon.[42]",
      "Other[edit]": "Local residents and tourists of Primorsky Territory and the Kuril Islands were warned of high waves, heavy rains and gusty winds as Ex-Talim approaches the area.[43]",
      "Impact[edit]": "5 deaths were reported and over 73 were injured, all in Japan. The total damages were estimated at $750 million (2017 USD).",
      "Ryukyu Islands[edit]": "On the night of September 13, heavy rains and gusty winds started to affect the Ryukyu Islands.[51] As Talim ripped Okinawa, starting on September 13, strong winds uprooted trees and over 20,000 households reported power outages in Miyako.[52] A record 479.04\u00a0mm (18.860\u00a0in) of rain was observed on September 20 on Miyako-jima Airport for 24 hours.[52][53] This is the heaviest rain the place suffered, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).[54][55][51]",
      "Japan[edit]": "As the typhoon made landfall on Kyushu on the morning of September 17, over 1,400 households in Miyazaki and Kumamoto were affected due to strong winds that downed electrical lines.[56][57][58] In the nearby Oita Prefecture, many rivers overflowed, affecting residents from the central to southern parts of the area.[59][60] The subsequent flooding in urban areas of the prefecture have prompted its governor to issue a disaster relief request.[61] An iron bridge was also washed away at the area.[62] The typhoon also flooded the Tsukumi and Tokuura Rivers in Tsukumi City.[63][60] There were also damages in Miyazaki Prefecture, including the a village in nearby Kagoshima.[64] On Tokyo, a scaffolding in a construction site collapsed, leading to a power outage of 2,700 households near the area.[65] On Saiki City and Tsukumi City in Oita Prefecture, some residents were trapped in their houses due to flash floods, which were immediately rescued by the authorities.[65] Five homes were entirely destroyed, 615 were partially destroyed, and 804 were partially damages, according to reports.[66] The Saeki, Tsukumi, and Usuki railway stations of Nipp\u014d Main Line, all in Oita Prefecture, were covered in mud due to the floodings.[62] In addition, a large-scale landslide occurred on the Tokuura signal field while sediment inflow was seen near the place.[67][62] However, no one was killed.[62] In addition, there was a coastal embarkment from the stations of Kaigantera until the end of the Takuta Station of the Shikoku Railway Company sustained damages.[68] The Yakuri and Kotodenshido stations of the Takamatsu-Kotohira Electric Railroad has its parts collapsed.[69] There were also reports of runoffs in the stations of Kyoto Tango Railway.[62] 5 deaths were attributed to Talim. An 86-year-old woman was found dead on September 17, due to her house pounded by a landslide in Kagawa Prefecture, while on K\u014dchi Prefecture, a 60-year man drowned in his car, due to a swollen river,[60] and two bodies were recovered from a riverbank.[70] In Oita Prefecture, a 70-year man was recorded missing, before founding him in an unknown place.[71][70] The last fatality of the storm was reported at Hokkaido, when another man, possibly in his 80s, was found dead in a beach.[72] 73 individuals were injured, in the other hand.[73]",

      "Typhoon Neoguri (2014)": "Typhoon Neoguri (pronounced [n\u028c.\u0261u.\u027ei]), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Florita, was a large and powerful tropical cyclone which struck Japan in 2014. The eighth named storm and the second typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Neoguri developed into a tropical storm on July 3 and then a typhoon on July 4. It rapidly deepened on July 5, reaching peak intensity late on July 6. Neoguri began to decay on July 7 and passed through Okinawa on July 8 and then making landfall over Kyushu as a severe tropical storm late on July 9. After Neoguri passed through the southern coast of Honsh\u016b on July 10, it became extratropical on July 11.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Late on June 30, a tropical disturbance formed about 120\u00a0nmi (220\u00a0km; 140\u00a0mi) east of Chuuk as a broad area of trough with flaring convection, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a low-pressure area formed at the same area late on the next day.[1][2][3] Late on July 2, JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression, as well as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at the same time, because of formative convective banding features under favourable environmental conditions with low vertical wind shear and good outflow.[4][5] Early on July 3, JMA began to issue tropical cyclone advisories for the system. Moreover, JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression with flaring and chaotic deep convection.[6][7] Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and designated it as 08W for an increase in organisation of the low-level circulation centre.[8] The JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Neoguri early on July 4, when a microwave imagery revealed that an eyewall was developing.[9][10] At 09:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded Neoguri to a severe tropical storm, and then to a typhoon only three hours later, when the system continued tracking northwestwards along the southern periphery of a deep subtropical ridge.[11][12] Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded Neoguri to a typhoon, when the system had further consolidated with an almost continuous eyewall.[13] On July 5, Neoguri rapidly deepened and consolidated as curved banding wrapped tighter into a ragged 25\u00a0nmi (45\u00a0km; 30\u00a0mi) eye, owing to the robust all-around outflow.[14] At noon, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave it the local name Florita for entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[15] On July 6, the eye of Neoguri became highly symmetric and attained a large size with a diameter of 35\u00a0nmi (65\u00a0km; 40\u00a0mi), when the system was still tracking west-northwestwards along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge to the north.[16] A microwave imagery revealed a small intense convective core and improved convective bands over the southern semi-circle, as well as the radial outflow supported the ongoing intensification.[17] Late on the same day, JTWC upgraded Neoguri to a super typhoon for its contracted eyewall, although the secondary outer eyewall had begun to form.[18] Simultaneously, JMA analysed that Neoguri had reached peak intensity, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 95 knots (175\u00a0km/h; 110\u00a0mph) and atmospheric pressure at 930\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg).[citation needed] Early on July 7, Neoguri began to track north-northwestwards along the southwest extension of a deep-layered subtropical ridge, when the JTWC reported that Neoguri had reached peak intensity as a Category 4 super typhoon with one-minute maximum sustained winds at 135 knots (250\u00a0km/h; 155\u00a0mph).[19] However, this was increased to 140 knots (260\u00a0km/h; 160\u00a0mph) in the best track, an upgrade to Category 5 super typhoon status. Under the influence of a very favourable environment, the system had an expansive areal coverage as tightly curved deep convective bands, mostly feeding from the southern flank, wrapped even tighter into the expanding and nearly annular eye.[20] However, the deep convection of the northwestern flank was almost eroded at noon, yet the round 40\u00a0nmi (75\u00a0km; 45\u00a0mi) eye maintained very well, prompting JTWC downgrading Neoguri to a typhoon late on the same day.[21][22] Although a digging mid-latitude trough was amplifying the upper-level poleward outflow and helping to maintain the intensity, it increased subsidence along the northwestern quadrant of Neoguri, which significantly hindered the development and caused a weakening trend.[23] From the evening to early July 8, overall convection of Neoguri significantly increased, when the typhoon began to turn northwards.[24] Later, Neoguri passed between Miyako-jima and Okinawa Island, right before starting to weaken gradually.[25] In the afternoon, convection of Neoguri began to diminish, as well as a noticeable dry slot formed along the eastern semi-circle.[26] The eye became obscured late on the same day, when the interaction with mid-latitude westerly trough was increasing.[27] Early on July 9, increasing vertical wind shear along the northwestern quadrant of Neoguri made deep convection erode very significantly.[28] Soon, JMA downgraded the system to a severe tropical storm when sharply turning eastwards, and cold stratocumulus clouds were streaming into a defined but elongating low-level circulation centre.[29][30] JTWC downgraded Neoguri to a tropical storm at noon, when the system was tracking along the periphery of the subtropical ridge modified by an approaching mid-latitude trough.[31] Right before 07:00 JST on July 10 (22:00 UTC on July 9), Neoguri made landfall near Akune, Kagoshima, and the system began to accelerate east-northeastwards.[25] Convection later continued to be greatly sheared southeastwards from the low-level circulation centre which was too broad, elongated, and unravelled to pinpoint, although the poleward outflow enhanced by the strong mid-latitude westerlies continued providing ventilation to the remnant wayward convection.[32] After Neoguri made landfall over the southern part of Wakayama Prefecture around 18:30 JST (09:30 UTC on July 10), JTWC issued the final warning to the fully exposed storm which was becoming extratropical with the forming frontal characteristics at noon, as well as JMA downgraded it to a tropical storm.[25][33][34] Neoguri then passed through Izu Peninsula around 02:30 JST on July 11 (17:30 UTC on July 10) and made landfall over Futtsu, Chiba right before 05:00 JST (20:00 UTC on July 10).[25] Early on July 11, Neoguri became an extratropical cyclone east of the Kant\u014d region and continued moving northeastwards.[35] After passing through Iturup and turning northwards late on the same day, the storm became below gale intensity at noon on July 12.[36][37] Neoguri completely dissipated in the Sea of Okhotsk one day later.[38]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "On July\u00a06, the Japan Meteorological Agency warned residents in the Ryukyu Islands that Typhoon Neoguri could be among the strongest storms to strike the country; it forecast the storm move through the Ryukyu Islands with a pressure of 910\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg). The JMA compared it to Typhoon Nancy in 1961, locally called \u7b2c2\u5ba4\u6238\u53f0\u98a8 (2nd Muroto Typhoon), which had a pressure of 925\u00a0hPa (27.3\u00a0inHg).[39]  After the agency started to monitor Neoguri under the local name of \"Florita\", the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration stated that it did not expect the typhoon to directly impact any part of the Philippines; however, PAGASA did expect the typhoon to enhance the Southwest Monsoon, bringing rains to some regions of the country.[40] The Japanese refiner company Nansei Sekiyu KK halted operations in Okinawa for the duration of the storm.[41] On July\u00a09, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways cancelled 40\u00a0flights collectively, affecting more than 2,000\u00a0travelers. Across Kyushu, officials urged nearly 90,000\u00a0residents to evacuate; most evacuations were in the city of Amakusa. Offshore drilling operations at JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corporation's Negishi refinery were suspended on July\u00a08 and 9.[41] In Okinawa Prefecture, 580,000 people in 18 municipalities were advised to evacuate. Fourteen of these municipalities recommended evacuation for the entire area encompassed by the municipality. Local government encouraged people within these municipalities to take shelter should they feel they were in danger, and advised for them to do so in strong buildings.[42]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Throughout Japan, 3 deaths and 67 injures caused by Typhoon Neoguri were confirmed, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of the Government of Japan. In K\u014driyama, Fukushima, an 83-year-old man fell into a swollen river and died. In Nagiso, Nagano, a landslide sent mud and rock tumbling down a mountainside, killing a 12-year-old boy. A 77-year-old man in Seiyo, Ehime was found dead in a canal.[43] In the prefectures of Okinawa, Nagano, and Kagoshima, it was reported that there were approximately 10,300 power failures. Three buildings in Nagano Prefecture and Okinawa Prefecture were destroyed completely and, in the same prefectures, eight buildings were partially destroyed. Altogether, 19 buildings took damage in Okinawa Prefecture.[44] Agricultural damage throughout Okinawa Prefecture amounted to \u00a53.08\u00a0billion (US$30.3\u00a0million).[45] Out ahead of the storm, a man drowned off the coast of Shikoku after his vessel capsized amid large swells.[41] Heavy rains affected a large swath of northern Honshu, with 237.5\u00a0mm (9.35\u00a0in) falling in Nagai, Yamagata and 154\u00a0mm (6.1\u00a0in) in Kitakata, Fukushima. This resulted in widespread and prolonged flooding, especially in Yamagata Prefecture where 56\u00a0homes were inundated and evacuation orders were put in place for Shirataka. Rail service from Akayu Station was suspended due to rail line damage; repairs were expected to take until July\u00a022.[46] Total damage in Japan topped at \u00a564\u00a0billion (US$632\u00a0million).[47] The typhoon's passage pulled a warm air mass over Japan, resulting in a widespread heat wave with temperatures across eastern Honshu and Hokkaido rose to their highest levels in 2014. Temperatures peaked at 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F) in Tatebayashi while Tokyo recorded 34.2\u00a0\u00b0C (93.6\u00a0\u00b0F); measurements reached 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F) in central Hokkaido.[48] Across eight prefectures, the high temperatures resulted in 1\u00a0fatality and 152\u00a0hospitalizations for heat stroke.[49] Neoguri also affected the Jeju Island. Parks and schools were closed,[50] while damage on the island were at \u20a9223\u00a0million (US$220,000).[51]",

      "Typhoon Skip": " Typhoon Skip, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Yoning, was the final of three tropical cyclones in 1988 to directly impact the Philippines in a two-week time frame. Several areas of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough around November\u00a01. One area situated to the south of Guam gradually became better organized, and by late November\u00a03, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression, and a tropical storm later that day. Steady deepening ensued as Skip veered west and the cyclone was upgraded into a typhoon on November\u00a05. The next day, Skip attained its maximum intensity of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Shortly after its peak, weakening ensued as the storm tracked across the Philippines. This trend continued once the cyclone entered the South China Sea, initially as a severe tropical storm late on November\u00a07. Slowing down in forward motion, Skip briefly turned west-northwest, then west and finally turned west-southwest before dissipating on November\u00a012. Typhoon Skip brought widespread impact to much of the already battered country. On Cebu island, almost 20,000\u00a0people were trapped in floodwaters. Along the slope of the Mayon Volcano, 2,600\u00a0people had to be evacuated due to a landslide. On the remote island of Palawan, 74\u00a0people were killed. Elsewhere, most towns in the Capiz province on Panay Island were flooded. Two people were killed and more than 700\u00a0people were evacuated from the Aklan province. In the Iloilo province, on the eastern portion of Panay Island, almost 40\u00a0villages were under water and nearby roads were impassable. Seventeen homes were demolished, and two people were confirmed to have been killed because of a landslide in Pasacao in the province of Camarines Sur. Throughout the city, ten people perished. Throughout the province, up to 27\u00a0people died and at least 20\u00a0others were hurt. In the suburbs of Manila, thirteen people drowned, all in three suburbs, but city proper itself avoided the worst impact from Skip. Overall, 237\u00a0people were killed as a result of the typhoon while 35\u00a0other people were injured. Throughout the country, damaged totaled $131.8\u00a0million (1988\u00a0USD).",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The first of two tropical cyclones to form in the basin during November\u00a01988, Typhoon Skip originated from the winter-time monsoon trough dominated by easterly trade winds, a common signal of a La Nina event. Several areas of low pressure developed along the axis of the monsoonal trough. On November\u00a01, an area of disturbed weather was noted near the Philippines; however, this would spawn Tropical Storm Tess instead. The next day, a second area of convection was noticed on weather satellite around 670\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) southwest of Guam.[1] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a03, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system.[2][nb 1] Several hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit. Satellite pictures at the time showed a well-defined center of circulation at the lower levels of the atmosphere and distinct curved banding features. Based on satellite images, intensity estimates of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 07:00\u00a0UTC. Four hours later, the TCFA was re-issued. That evening, following an increase in satellite intensity estimates,[1] both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm,[4][nb 2] the latter of which named it Skip.[1] Skip, while taking the course of a typical \"straight runner\",[1] the storm made its closest approach to Yap, passing around 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) to the south.[6] Tropical Storm Skip steadily intensified over a period of several days. Early November\u00a04, the JMA upgraded Skip into a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated that Skip attained typhoon intensity,[4] and the following morning, the JMA followed suit.[2] At noon on November\u00a05, the JTWC reported that Skip attained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), equivalent to a low-end Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS).[4] The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started to follow the storm and assigned it with the local name Yoning.[7] Continuing westward,[1] the JTWC suggested that the typhoon attained winds equal to a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the SSHWS at 00:00\u00a0UTC on November\u00a06.[4] At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the JTWC increased the intensity of Skip to 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), just shy of super typhoon intensity.[1] Six hours later, the JMA reported that Skip reached its peak intensity, with winds of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[2] Early on November\u00a07, Skip made landfall over Samar in the eastern Philippines.[6] During the evening of November\u00a07, Skip emerged into the South China Sea[1] as a typhoon and severe tropical storm, according to both the JTWC and JMA respectively.[4] Following a decrease in forward speed, Skip moved west-northwest to the south of a subtropical ridge for the next four days.[1] By early November\u00a010, the JTWC assessed the intensity at 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) while the JMA reported winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). Rapid weakening then began; however,[4] and the JTWC downgraded Skip to a tropical storm later that day.[1] After Skip turned towards the southwest,[6] the JTWC stopped tracking the system early on November\u00a011.[1] After turning west on November\u00a011, and then finally moved to the northwest, Skip dissipated while the center was still offshore, about 220\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Danang on November\u00a012.[2] The remnants of Typhoon Skip continued the linger over the Gulf of Tonkin before fully dissipating.[1]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "On November\u00a06, storm warnings were posted in Samar, Leyte, and much of the Visayas chain, as well as, for the Bicol Peninsula on Luzon, which was just reeling from the effects of Typhoon Ruby and Tropical Storm Tess, in preparation for the typhoon.[8] The next day, this alert was expanded into the northeastern provinces of Mindanao Island.[9] Simultaneously, a lower level alert was issued for half of Luzon, including the capital of Manila.[10] Small crafts were ordered to stay at port.[11] Philippine Airlines canceled 75\u00a0domestic flights as the storm approached.[12][13] The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) suspended all passenger ship service to ports in the Visayas Islands on November\u00a06, stranding thousands of passengers in Manila and other major ports throughout the nation.[12] Select Military Airlift Command flights to Japan and the United States left early to avoid the core of the typhoon.[14] The city of Manila ordered all schools to close for a day.[15]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "Across the Leyte island, the storm knocked nearly 200,000\u00a0people without power[12] and caused $400,000 (1988 USD) in damages.[16] On Cebu island, in San Jose, 80%\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0city was under water at the height of the storm.[15] One person was killed in Cebu City.[17] Island-wide, almost 20,000\u00a0people were trapped in floodwaters.[14] Along the slope of the Mayon Volcano, landslides triggered by heavy rains forced 2,600\u00a0people to be evacuated from the slopes of the volcano.[12] All roads were impassible and thirty-nine people were killed in Tablas Island.[18] Elsewhere, three people drowned on Marinduque island.[19] Two fatalities occurred in Tacloban.[17] Two others were killed in Agusan.[20] Skip triggered widespread flooding on the island of Palawan, especially on the southern part of the remote island. There, seventy four people were killed[19][21] and ninety-five were initially listed missing.[17] In a small hamlet of Gilligan on the island of Palawan, the Philippine Red Cross reported that 900\u00a0people lost their lives; however, authorities insisted only eight people were killed[21] and that Tropical Storm Tess brought far worse impacts to the region.[22] Nearby, eight casualties occurred in Mindoro.[21] At least 10\u00a0small\u00a0fishing\u00a0boats went missing off Negros.[17] Moreover, 14 of the 16\u00a0towns in Capiz province\u2013located on Panay Island to the southeast of Manila\u2013were flooded,[12] resulting in hundreds of families being evacuated to schools and churches.[12] Greater than 700\u00a0people were evacuated from low-lying areas of the Aklan province,[14] where two people perished.[15] In the Iloilo province, on the eastern part of Panay Island, close to 40\u00a0villages were under water. Roads around the provincial capital, Iloilo City, were impassible and two major bridges were washed away.[17] Two major bridges were swept away by the typhoon. Throughout Panay Island, eight fatalities were reported, seven of which were drownings while another person was electrocuted by a downed power line.[23] Seventeen homes were demolished,[16] 23\u00a0people were buried,[12] and ten bodies were recovered[16] on a landslide in Pasacao in the province of Camarines Sur.[14] Throughout the city, ten people, six of whom were children, were killed.[14] Elsewhere in Camarines Sur, two children died in a tornado.[14] Province-wide, 19\u00a0to\u00a027 people perished[24] and at minimum 20 were wounded.[25] Unlike during Ruby, Manila avoided the inner core of Typhoon Skip,[14] though there were reports of waist-high water in some neighborhoods, forcing residents to use wooden planks and tires to navigate the floodwaters.[26] However, the suburb of Pasig, already inundated by Typhoon Ruby a couple weeks prior, faced additional flooding, resulting in the deaths of seven children.[15] Throughout the metro area, thirteen people drowned, all in three suburbs.[27] A freighter, the Sea Runner, sank in port on Bohol Island due to strong winds and heavy waves from Skip. All 17\u00a0crewmen escaped. However, the ship's cargo of 11,250\u00a0bags of cement was lost.[12] Nineteen crewmen fled in a life raft when the tanker Ethane ran aground off a small island 110\u00a0mi (175\u00a0km) south of Manila. A passenger ship, the Sampaguita, sunk just offshore Zamboanga City in the extreme southern portion of the country but all passengers and crew were reported safe. Two small ships, however, were rendered missing.[28] In all, the storm directly affected 3,027,601\u00a0people, or 318,968\u00a0families. Nationwide, 146\u00a0people were injured.[29] Infrastructure damage totaled $106.2\u00a0million (1988 USD), while damage to agriculture accumulated to $16.5\u00a0million and damage totaled $8.9\u00a0million in private properties. Overall, Skip was responsible for $131.8\u00a0million in damage.[30][nb 3] Additionally, 144,136\u00a0people or 28,824\u00a0families were evacuated to shelters as a result of the flooding. In all, 237\u00a0people were killed due to Typhoon Skip.[21][31] Since many roads in the devastated area were impassable, officials were forced to ferry relief goods to stranded residents by small boats and military helicopters.[32] The Canadian Red Cross donated CD$5,000, while the city of Ottawa donated CD$150,000.[33]",

      "Tropical Storm Hermine (2010)": " Tropical Storm Hermine was a near-hurricane strength tropical cyclone that brought widespread flooding from Guatemala northwards to Oklahoma in early September\u00a02010. Though it was named in the western Gulf of Mexico, Hermine developed directly from the remnant low-pressure area associated with the short-lived Tropical Depression Eleven-E in the East Pacific. Throughout its lifespan, the storm caused 52\u00a0direct deaths and roughly US$740\u00a0million in damage to crops and infrastructure, primarily in Guatemala. The precursor tropical depression formed on September\u00a03 in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and neared tropical storm intensity before making landfall near Salina Cruz, Mexico, on the next day. Though the depression quickly weakened to a remnant low, the disturbance crossed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and tracked north into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where it reorganized into a tropical cyclone once again on September\u00a05. There, the system quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and received the name Hermine before moving ashore near Matamoros, Mexico on September\u00a07 as a high-end tropical storm. Over the next few days, Hermine weakened as it moved over the U.S. Southern Plains, eventually dissipating over Kansas on September\u00a010. In the Eastern Pacific, Tropical Depression Eleven-E, along with moisture from a monsoonal flow, brought torrential rains to southern Mexico and Guatemala. At least 84 people were killed in the two countries and damage exceeded $500\u00a0million. In northern Mexico, the effects of Tropical Storm Hermine were limited. Further north, severe flooding affected large parts of Texas and Oklahoma, killing eight people and leaving at least $240\u00a0million in losses. Despite the deaths and damage, the name Hermine was not retired.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In August\u00a02010, a tropical wave in the eastern Atlantic contributed to the formation of Hurricane Danielle;[1] Danielle eventually tracked west and then northward before dissipating south of Newfoundland after ten days.[2] However, the southern portion of the disturbance became disassociated with Danielle's development and tracked west into Northern South America, reaching the East Pacific on August\u00a029. Thunderstorm activity was confined over Central America until September\u00a02, when showers developed over and around the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[1] The National Hurricane Center\u00a0(NHC) first assessed a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis at 00:00\u00a0UTC the following day.[3] Throughout September\u00a03, the disturbance quickly developed in the gulf before a wind circulation at the surface beneath the system was detected;[4] thus, the NHC designated the developing system as a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC that day when the storm was 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico.[1] Following formation, Eleven-E moved slowly towards the northwest and developed a well-pronounced inner rainband late on September\u00a03.[5] At 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day, the depression peaked with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) before making landfall an hour later east of Salina Cruz.[1] The cyclone's organized appearance on radar, which included a developing primordial eye, suggested that the depression was near tropical storm intensity at the time of landfall.[6] A ship documented tropical storm-force winds during this period, but as they were well removed from the storm, it is believed that these stronger winds were associated with a nearby monsoonal wind flow. After moving inland, the depression quickly deteriorated and became a remnant low-pressure area by 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04 over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.[1] Though the mountainous terrain of Oaxaca and Chiapas greatly disrupted Tropical Depression Eleven-E's organization and led to its demise, the former cyclone's mid- and lower-level circulations remained intact as they moved into the Bay of Campeche. New and intense convection arose as soon as the vortex moved back over open water on September\u00a04, hours after Eleven-E's declassification.[1] Over the next day, the area of thunderstorms, initially disorganized,[7] coalesced into a tropical depression once again in the southern Bay of Campeche at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05. Twelve hours after formation, the NHC upgraded the system to tropical storm status following conclusive reports from a nearby buoy. As a result, the tropical cyclone was named Hermine. Steady intensification continued as Hermine gravitated towards the Texas-Mexico border.[8] Thunderstorm activity increased during the morning of September\u00a06 as they continued to wrap around the center of the storm.[9] Later that day, an eye was detected using radar imagery based in Brownsville, Texas, though the storms surrounding it remained rather meager.[9] At 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07, Hermine made landfall near Matamoros, Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 989\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.21\u00a0inHg); this was the cyclone's peak intensity.[8] After moving ashore, Hermine slowly weakened and moved northward into Texas.[10] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, the weakening tropical cyclone degenerated to tropical depression strength near Mason, Texas.[8] However, Hermine's gusts remained much stronger than its sustained winds. Shortly after the downgrade, the NHC transferred its cyclone monitoring responsibilities to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center\u00a0(HPC).[11] By that time, the weakening storm had lost most of its tropical cyclone characteristics, with a long line of thunderstorms extending southwards and paralleling Interstate 35.[12] Hermine was determined to have weakened to a remnant low-pressure area over Oklahoma at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09, before dissipating over Kansas on the next day.[8]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Prior to Hermine's landfall, officials in Mexico issued evacuations orders for parts of northern Tamaulipas. An estimated 3,500 people heeded these warnings.[13] In Texas, the State Operations Center held a conference in relation to Tropical Storm Hermine to discuss emergency plans. Six flood rescue teams were placed on standby; Mass Care and American Red Cross were prepared to set up shelters; ten Texas Military high-profile vehicles along with UH60 and CH47 helicopters were on standby for potential flood relief efforts.[14] By the afternoon of September\u00a06, much of southern Texas was under a flash flood watch due to the threat of torrential downpours.[15] Tornado watches extended from the coastline to northern Texas along the right side of the storm.[16] As Hermine produced heavy rains from Texas to Missouri, the National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings for many areas.[17] At one point, the entire state of Oklahoma was placed under a flash flood watch and most of the southeastern counties were under warnings.[18]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Central America[edit]": "Across Guatemala, heavy rains associated with a monsoonal flow and Tropical Depression Eleven-E triggered numerous landslides across the country. Along the Inter-American Highway, 41 people were killed after consecutive landslides buried a bus and rescue workers trying to pull survivors out of the trapped vehicle.[1] The initial landslide killed 12 people in the bus. Hundreds of rescuers came to the site to try to save as many people as possible; however, a second landslide struck the same spot, burying hundreds of people. According to press reports, at least 41 people died along the highway and more than 100 others are believed to be dead. Throughout the country, officials stated that 30 landslides took place. One of these killed four more people after destroying their home in Quetzaltenango.[19] Throughout the country, damage was estimated at $500\u00a0million.[20] Heavy rains in Costa Rica associated with the system triggered a landslide that killed three people and displaced hundreds.[21]",
      "Mexico[edit]": "Heavy impact was reported in southern Mexico, and several rivers overflowed their banks in the coast Oaxaca and thus a red (high) alert was issued.[22] A total of 50,000 people were affected from the depression in Mexico.[23] At least 46 people are known to have been killed throughout Oaxaca.[24] The system produced locally heavy rains in Veracruz, with a peak measurement of 13.6\u00a0in (350\u00a0mm) in Alvarado. In northern Mexico, rainfall over 3\u00a0in (76\u00a0mm) was confined to coastal areas. Throughout northern Tamaulipas tropical-storm-force winds downed trees, power lines and damaged several structures. Sustained winds of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and gusts of 67\u00a0mph (108\u00a0km/h) were recorded in Matamoros.[8] At least 20 homes were damaged throughout the city; no loss of life or injuries took place.[13]",
      "United States[edit]": "As reports of widespread flooding came out of Texas, evacuation orders were issued for some of the hardest hit areas and seven shelters were opened in four counties. The Salvation Army set up mobile feeding units along the Interstate 35 corridor to support flood response operations.[42] In the wake of the severe flooding caused by Tropical Storm Hermine, Texas governor Rick Perry declared 40 affected counties as disaster areas and requested that 13 of these be federal disaster areas. Just two days after the storm's passage, insurance claims had reached $75\u00a0million and were expected to exceed $100\u00a0million.[43] In early October, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) denied governor Perry's requests for the 13 counties, stating that damage was not substantial enough to warrant federal aid.[44] However, it was argued that since most of the hardest hit communities were rural areas with limited resources, they would need assistance recovering.[45] On October\u00a012, governor Rick Perry filed a formal appeal to President Barack Obama to reconsider the denial of public assistance. Following further damage assessments, governor Perry also stated that at least $13\u00a0million was needed to repair losses.[46] Following this appeal, FEMA again denied federal assistance.[45] On November\u00a010, The U.S. Small Business Administration passed a disaster declaration for 18 counties in Texas, allowing residents to apply for low-interest loans.[47] On September\u00a010, Oklahoma governor Brad Henry declared a state of emergency for 13 counties and later requested federal assistance for Sequoyah County.[48] However, the request for federal aid was later denied by FEMA.[38]",
      "Texas[edit]": "In Texas, strong winds were recorded in Harlingen where sustained winds reached 59\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) and gusted to 73\u00a0mph (117\u00a0km/h). Elsewhere in Texas, large portions of the state east of where Hermine's center tracked recorded gale-force-winds.[8] Along the coast, the system also brought a storm surge, peaking at 3.4\u00a0ft (1.0\u00a0m) in Port Aransas.[8] Damage over the lower Rio Grande Valley was generally minor. Some trees and power lines were knocked down as a result of the high winds, resulting in power outages over the area. About 30,000 customers lost power at one time or another during the storm in the region. The hardest hit were in Cameron and Willacy Counties.[30] In central Texas, an estimated 100,000 residences were left without power, mainly in Bexar County, due to downed trees. According to surveys of the region, roughly 300 trees were downed by the storm. In Georgetown, where the heaviest rain fell, RV parks and nearby I-35 were flooded, prompting a few evacuations.[31] Throughout the state, hundreds high water rescues had to be made by rescue teams. Some areas recorded flood waters up to 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) deep.[17] In Johnson County, more than 60\u00a0water rescues were made after flash flooding inundated numerous homes. According to fire Chief Richard Van Winkle of the Alvarado fire department, \"This is about as bad as I've seen it\".[18] In the town, one person was killed after he drove his car into a flooded street and was swept away.[18] In Arlington, 90 people had to be evacuated from an apartment building after a nearby creek flooded, leaving some of the rooms under 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) of water. Over 50 homes were severely damaged and eventually purchased a year later by the city. The creek also swept through a nearby neighborhood with enough force to uproot trees in its path. In Bell County, severe flooding resulted in one fatality after a 19-year-old girl drowned when her car was swept off a flooded road.[32] Several tornadoes were spawned throughout Texas as a result of Hermine.[31] A brief EF0\u00a0tornado, which resulted in little damage, was confirmed near Moulton, Texas.[33] The strongest tornado struck Dallas just west of North Westmoreland Road near La Reunion Parkway, damaging several structures.[17] This tornado was later rated EF2 with estimated winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). This was the strongest tornado to strike Dallas since an F4 in 1974. Throughout northern Texas, six tornadoes were confirmed and several more likely touched down elsewhere in the state.[34] According to the Red Cross, a total of 843\u00a0homes were affected by the storm throughout Texas; 68 were destroyed, 231 sustained major damage and 283 received minor damage.[35] Another flood-related fatality took place in Johnson County.[36] In Jamaica Beach, Texas, one woman drowned in a rip current related to the oncoming Hermine and others needed to be rescued.[37]",
      "Oklahoma[edit]": "After moving through Texas, the remnants of Hermine produced widespread rainfall, locally heavy, in Oklahoma which triggered significant flooding.[17] One person was killed in the state as result of Hermine's passage.[8] Nearly all of Sequoyah County was left underwater, resulting in severe infrastructural damage. Nearly 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) were washed away by the floods. Preliminary estimates placed damage in the county were $2.5\u00a0million.[38] Scattered power outages took place in the state, mainly attributed to tornadoes, with the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company reporting roughly 5,000\u00a0outages. The National Weather Service confirmed three tornadoes in relation to Hermine, including an EF0\u00a0tornado that struck Lone Grove, a town devastated by an EF4 tornado in February 2009.[39] In Colbert, an EF1\u00a0tornado destroyed one home and injured a truck driver after knocking his vehicle on its side. During the morning of September\u00a09, a second round of rain fell across eastern portions of the state, resulting in additional flooding. Along US 69, a portion of the roadway was covered with several feet of water. Other state highways were flooded as well; however, most of the water receded that afternoon.[40]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "",
      "Guatemala[edit]": "In response to the substantial loss of life along Inter-American Highway, Guatemalan President \u00c1lvaro Colom declared a state of emergency for the country.[41] On September\u00a06, President Colom declared a national day of mourning for victims of the storm.[19]",

      "Hurricane Leslie (2018)": " Hurricane Leslie (known as\u00a0Storm Leslie[1] or Cyclone Leslie[2] while extratropical) was the strongest cyclone of tropical origin to strike the Iberian Peninsula since 1842. A large, long-lived, and very erratic tropical cyclone, Leslie was the twelfth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season.[3] The storm had a non-tropical origin, developing from an extratropical cyclone that was situated over the northern Atlantic on 22 September. The low quickly acquired subtropical characteristics and was classified as Subtropical Storm Leslie on the following day. The cyclone meandered over the northern Atlantic and gradually weakened, before merging with a frontal system on 25 September, which later intensified into a powerful hurricane-force extratropical low over the northern Atlantic. While Leslie began to weaken late on 27 September, the low began to re-acquire subtropical characteristics, and by 28 September, Leslie had completed the transition to a subtropical storm once again. Leslie became fully tropical and gradually intensified, becoming a Category\u00a01 hurricane early on 3 October, and initially peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) later that day. Leslie gradually weakened, falling to tropical storm intensity late on 4 October. The cyclone continued to slowly weaken before beginning to re-intensify on 8 October. Two days later, Leslie reached hurricane status for the second time. Leslie continued to slowly strengthen, reaching peak intensity with sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.59\u00a0inHg), early on 12 October. Leslie then began to gradually weaken later that day, while accelerating towards the northeast and passed far south of the Azores. On 13 October, Leslie passed north of Madeira, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone just off the Portuguese coast later that day. Leslie's remnants made landfall in central Portugal a few hours later. The low continued moving northeastward while rapidly weakening, passing over the Bay of Biscay, before dissipating by 16 October over Spain. The storm was responsible for 17 deaths in mainland Europe, including 2 direct deaths in Portugal and 15 indirect deaths in France. In November 2018, Aon estimated that Leslie's damage total exceeded \u20ac424\u00a0million (US$500\u00a0million).[nb 1] Hurricane Leslie prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for Madeira Island. Leslie brought wind gusts up to 190\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) to Portugal, felling thousands of trees, causing the collapse of hundreds of structures, and damaging hundreds of buildings, signs, and pieces of equipment. Over 300,000 citizens were left without power. Damage across the country was estimated to be \u20ac120\u00a0million (US$145\u00a0million). City, municipal, and the national government provided funds to repair damage to buildings as well as the local forests, and also launch cleanup efforts. Leslie brought strong winds and torrential rainfall to Spain, most notably the Catalonia region, causing a river to spill its banks, nearly four dozen landslides to occur, and damaging several structures and vehicles. The storm disrupted transportation and caused 14,000 power outages throughout the country. Leslie and a cold front, the latter of which was almost stationary, combined to cause record-breaking flooding in the Aude, France. The flooding in the department was considered to be the worst since 1891. Floodwaters damaged buildings, roads, and vehicles throughout several towns and cities, causing \u20ac220\u00a0million (US$254\u00a0million) in damage.

      "Origins, formation, and tropical transition[edit]": "The United States-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) began forecasting on 19 September 2018 that an extratropical low would form in a few days between the Azores and Bermuda.[4] This system developed along the boundary of a front early on 22 September, approximately 1,295\u00a0km (805\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Flores Island.[5] This system was associated with the southern portion of the remnants of Hurricane Florence, which had previously split into two storms on 18 September.[6][7] Amid favorable environmental conditions,[8] the system separated from the front, and its banding features became better established, signaling the formation of Subtropical Storm Leslie by 12:00 UTC on 23 September.[5] Around that time, Leslie was within an upper-level low and the former's gale-force winds were displaced from the center.[9] The subtropical cyclone was located within an area of minimal steering currents, causing the storm's movement to be erratic.[5][10] Moderate vertical wind shear and dry air hindered the development of thunderstorm activity or convection outside the southeastern portion of the system, as it tracked generally southwestward.[11] The cyclone turned towards the south and later the east on 24 September.[12][13] During that time, Leslie's cloud pattern became irregular, with several cloud swirls existing within a broadening circulation.[14] Leslie weakened into a subtropical depression around 00:00 UTC on 25 September, due to the continuing wind shear and dry air.[5] The storm began a southeastward motion later in the day,[15] followed by a turn back to the east. Leslie became an extratropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC, after its circulation expanded along a baroclinic zone. At that time, an expansive stratocumulus cloud shield was becoming established and cold, stable air was entering the region.[16] During the next couple of days, Leslie's track consisted of an incomplete counterclockwise loop. At the same time, the baroclinic processes strengthened the extratropical cyclone, leading to hurricane-force winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) by 00:00 UTC on 27 September. A weakening trend commenced during the middle of the day and persisted until 28 September. However, as Leslie tracked westward, it began to reacquire tropical characteristics and was declared a subtropical storm once more around 12:00 UTC.[5] The storm had reestablished bands of convection near its center and its wind field had shrunk considerably. While Leslie had transitioned from a cold core to a warm core system, it was still located within a sizable low-pressure system.[17] Over the next couple of days, the cyclone experienced minimal change in strength as it tracked in a southwesterly direction around the western edge of an extensive cyclonic circulation.[5] Thunderstorm activity developed near Leslie's center and anticyclonic outflow materialized to the northeast and southeast of the system. As a result, Leslie became a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC on 29 September, while it was located approximately 1,850\u00a0km (1,150\u00a0mi) west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores.[5][18]",
      "Initial peak intensity and weakening[edit]": "Located within a region of cool sea surface temperatures and strong northwesterly wind shear,[18][19] the tropical storm intensified little during the next couple of days.[5] Banding features began to increase on 1 October, as the wind shear subsided.[20] Leslie continued a west-southwestward to southwestward motion over the next day or so, while located in weak steering currents and positioned between high-pressure systems that were located to the west and northeast.[5] As Leslie began to strengthen more quickly on 2 October, convection increased both in intensity and organization. Microwave imagery displayed that Leslie had developed an eye at its low levels.[21] The storm intensified into a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on 3 October.[5] Meanwhile, Leslie became stationary, with its southerly movement ending.[22] Leslie reached its initial peak at 18:00 UTC as a Category 1 hurricane, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph).[5] At the time, the storm had a large, irregular eye, with sporadic dry air entrainment. The storm began to track northward between a shortwave trough, which was located to the northeast, and a mid-level ridge, which was located to Leslie's southeast.[23] Moving over cooler, 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures, Leslie began to weaken slowly on 4 October.[5][24] The cyclone weakened to a tropical storm around 18:00 UTC.[5] By 5 October, Leslie's inner core had dissipated, and the storm possessed only small bands of convection on the outer limits of its circulation.[25] Convection refired over the storm's center later that day, although the maximum winds were located 165\u2013185\u00a0km (103\u2013115\u00a0mi) away.[26] Leslie turned towards the east from late 5 October to 6 October, under the influence of mid-latitude westerly flow.[27][28] Although the tropical storm traversed a region of even colder, 24\u201325\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u201377\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures during the next couple of days and was located in a region of moderate wind shear,[5][29] the storm changed little in strength.[5] Leslie's convection became more organized on 6 October, as banding features became more defined and a mid-level eye formed to the southeast of the storm's low-level circulation center.[30] Leslie turned towards the east-southeast on 7 October, still under the influence of the westerly flow.[31] Leslie bottomed out as an 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) tropical storm at 00:00 UTC, as it passed over an area of cool sea surface temperatures.[5][32]",
      "Peak intensity, extratropical transition, and demise[edit]": "Leslie began to restrengthen later on 8 October, as an inner core began to develop and convection became more intense.[5][33] While the storm continued to track in a southeastward direction, traversing an environment of warmer sea surface temperatures and lower wind shear, a mid-level eye feature began to develop.[34] Turning towards the south, Leslie restrengthened into a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on 10 October.[5] Around that time, the storm's strongest convection was concentrated towards the north, and an irregular eye had emerged on satellite imagery.[35] The cyclone began to proceed east-northeastward early on 11 October, as strengthening continued.[5][36] Leslie peaked at 00:00 UTC on 12 October as a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg), while located approximately 1,065\u00a0km (662\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Flores Island.[5] The storm had a small, cloud-filled eye around that time.[37] Leslie began to slowly weaken once more later that day, as sea surface temperatures decreased to 23\u201324\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u201375\u00a0\u00b0F) and wind shear increased.[5][38] The mid-latitude westerly flow began to rapidly accelerate Leslie towards the east-northeast, with the cyclone passing 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Madeira Island around 06:00 UTC on 13 October.[5] Shortly after, Leslie began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, as colder air entered from the south and west and the system's mid-level eye decayed.[39] The cyclone's convection continued to disintegrate as a result of even colder 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) sea surface temperatures and strong wind shear.[40][41] The NHC issued its final advisory on Leslie around 21:00 UTC on 13 October, after the storm became fully extratropical.[5][41] The cyclone moved ashore near Figueira da Foz at 21:00 UTC, with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Leslie weakened as it traversed the Bay of Biscay on 14 October,[5] reaching western France by 15 October.[42][43]\nAn almost stationary, convective cold front over southern France was assisted by Leslie. The latter helped to spawn a surface low over the Mediterranean Sea which increased convection near the cold front, and it provided unstable air parcels, reduced evaporation, and added moisture to the mid-levels of the airmass over France.[44][45] Leslie's remnant was absorbed into Hurricane Michael's extratropical remnant by 16 October, following a brief Fujiwhara interaction.[43][46][47][48]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "A tropical storm watch was issued for Madeira on 11 October, at 21:00 UTC. The watch was upgraded to a warning at 03:00 UTC on 12 October.[5] Over 180 sports games were canceled as Leslie approached.[49] Multiple flights were canceled on 12 October, and all flights were canceled on 13 October.[50][51] In Funchal, all bathhouses and a park were closed. Sea voyages to Porto Santo were postponed and fishermen were ordered to move ashore by authorities.[52] At least 13 districts in Portugal were placed under a red alert from 13 to 14 October, in anticipation of adverse weather conditions from Leslie.[53][54][55] Alerts were also issued by Portugal for Madeira and the Azores.[56] A 1990s-themed party at the Lisbon International Fair was moved back a week as Leslie approached.[57] Fishing vessels were asked to return to port and surfers were ordered to move ashore.[58][59] Seaside streets were closed between Parede and Carcavelos,[60] as well as river routes in the Tagus between Trafaria, Porto Brand\u00e3o and Bel\u00e9m were closed on 13 October, as Leslie approached Portugal.[61] Nine ports in Portugal were closed to naval traffic due to the storm.[62] At least 29 flights were canceled in Lisbon and Funchal, and 12 others were canceled in Porto.[62][63] Several shows and events in Lisbon, including the Lisbon Marathon, were either canceled or postponed.[62][64] A yellow alert was declared for 25 provinces in Spain during the storm. An orange alert was issued for the provinces of Barcelona, Castell\u00f3n, Huesca, Lleida, Navarra, Tarragona, Teruel, Zaragoza, Girona, and the Balearic Islands.[65][66] In Seville, parks were closed on 13 October as a precaution, due to Leslie's approach. All parks but the Parque de Los Pr\u00edncipes were reopened the next day, which was closed for repairs.[67] The Aude, H\u00e9rault, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, Tarn, Haute-Garonne, and Aveyron departments in France were all placed under an orange alert, due to the expectation of strong winds and flooding rainfall from the approaching Leslie.[68]",
      "Impact[edit]": "In November 2018, Aon estimated that Leslie's damage total exceeded \u20ac424\u00a0million (US$500\u00a0million).[69]",
      "Portugal[edit]": "A marketplace was closed in Figueira da Foz due to roof damage, causing losses of \u20ac700 thousand (US$853 thousand) to local fishermen.[153] Tree removal work began immediately after the storm;[154] around 150 trucks were mobilized to remove the fallen trees.[155] However, the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests estimated that the removal work would take at least 6 months.[154][156] Around 80 percent of the trees planted in pine forests along the coast of Leiria, in areas heavily affected by wildfires and Leslie, died. In order to aid the recovery of the forest, plantings would continue for multiple years. Roads were also to be improved as a part of the project, which had a financial backing of \u20ac18\u00a0million (US$21.9\u00a0million).[157] Around \u20ac220,000 (US$268,000) were donated to fund the removal and sawing of felled trees in the Bussaco National Forest. Additional funds were donated to finance the planting of over 35,000 additional trees.[109] Near the Palace Hotel, 100 trees were planted in an area damaged by Leslie in order to honor the life of Nelson Mandela.[158] Despite being considered a public interest, the 300-year-old ash tree was cut down on 14 November 2019.[121] Months after Leslie, students protested about the condition of the College of Arts building at the University of Coimbra, which was one of those damaged during the storm.[159] In Chernache, the Aerodrome Bissaya Barreto was closed from 30 May\u20137 June 2019, due to additional problems after Leslie had removed its windsock.[160] Around 10,000 personnel were mobilized to deal with fallen trees and landslides in Mira.[103] Municipal authorities worked to clear fallen trees and repair broken walls and signage.[102] Authorities activated the emergency municipal plan in Montemor-o-Velho, Figueira da Foz, Condeixa-a-Nova, Soure, Coimbra, and Mira to aid with cleanup and relief efforts.[161][162] The district emergency plan was activated for Coimbra district.[62] Fifty generators were provided by Pombal municipal officials to restore power to residences and small businesses.[113] The Portuguese government anticipated an expenditure of \u20ac36\u00a0million (US$43.8\u00a0million) would be required to aid the forest industry.[163] Fisheries near Figueira da Foz operated at below normal capacity through 2020, due to a reduction in sardine supply that occurred after Leslie moved through the area.[164] Although the Portuguese government agreed to cover 70 percent of the costs of reconstruction for the Equestrian Center of Montemor-o-Velho, it had not provided the funds two years post-storm.[105] Initially, on 27 November 2018, the Portuguese government rejected a proposal to provide relief funds for victims of the storm.[165] The government provided \u20ac1.4\u00a0million (US$1.7\u00a0million) out of a maximum of \u20ac8.3\u00a0million (US$10.1\u00a0million) in aid to 24 municipalities in 2019.[166] They provided another \u20ac3.6\u00a0million (US$4.3\u00a0million) to those municipalities in 2020.[88][167][168] The legislature allocated \u20ac20\u00a0million (US$24.3\u00a0million) in aid to the agricultural sector.[84][169][170] The Portuguese government opened up \u20ac15\u00a0million (US$17.7\u00a0million) in relief funds for farmers who sustained damage to buildings, equipment, livestock, and permanent crops.[171] At least seven companies received financial aid totalling \u20ac391,000 (US$478,000).[172] Social organizations that experienced large financial woes had not received relief funding from the Portuguese government two years after the storm.[173] The legislative body was criticised for being slow in authorising the release of funds to these organizations.[174] The Coimbra City Council approved a measure on 30 June to repair the Celas Integrated Sports Center and a building at the Campo Municipal da Arrega\u00e7a, both of which were severely damaged by Leslie.[175] Despite repairs having taken place at the sports center, it remained closed nearly a year after Leslie passed through the region.[176] In 2021, the Rural Development Program provided \u20ac98,000 (US$120,000) in aid to help repair damage caused in the Choupal National Forest. At least 5,000 new trees were to be planted and 700 damaged ones either cut down or trimmed.[177] To aid recovery efforts, \u20ac5\u00a0million (US$6.1\u00a0million) in funds were approved for a recovery plan for the Leiria National Forest in the Marinha Grande Municipality. The plan included the planting of at least 230 trees to restore the forest after Leslie and a 2017 fire destroyed most of it.[178] The Miranda do Corvo city council approved \u20ac74,850 (US$91,400) in funds to rebuild the Senhor da Serra Pavilion, which was entirely destroyed by the storm.[179] The council also approved \u20ac34,085 (US$41,600) in aid to repair the headquarters for the Vale do A\u00e7or Recreational, Cultural and Sports Association.[180]",
      "Coimbra District[edit]": "The storm made landfall near Figueira da Foz, which is located 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) north of Lisbon. Authorities in Lisbon requested that all residents remain indoors. Around 800 people took refuge in a concert hall in Figueira da Foz.[70] Wind gusts of 176\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) downed trees and traffic signs, with the former causing several traffic accidents.[62] In the city, six vehicles were damaged by a collapsing building, and another five were damaged by falling trees. Multiple homes in the area were deroofed.[89] Three schools and the Figueira da Foz District Hospital were damaged by the storm.[90] Near the shoreline, a car was pulverized and a restaurant was reduced to rubble.[89] A roof was ripped off a building and blown across an esplanade by strong winds.[91]  A high-voltage power pole collapsed in Leirosa, falling on a house; the roof of the house subsequently collapsed. A surf instruction center near Praia da Leirosa was lifted onto another property. Strong winds picked up a trailer and tossed it on top of another.[92] At least 80 trailers were either damaged or destroyed in the park.[93] Hundreds of residences, businesses, and fishing piers sustained damage.[83][94] Figueira da Foz was considered the worst-hit municipality, with the storm inflicting \u20ac38\u00a0million (US$46.2\u00a0million) in damage.[95] At least 3,500 trees were downed near Serra da Boa Viagem alone.[83] The core trees of the forest, which had survived two wildfires in 1993 and 2005 and a major storm in 2013, was largely destroyed. Falling trees smashed concrete picnic tables at a park.[96] The roofs of four bungalows sustained damage, and the balcony cover and glass of another was shattered. The Casa do Parque suffered roof damage; six changing rooms experienced both internal and roof damage, and a dishwashing station was destroyed.[97] Nearly 40 percent of the trees in the Choupal National Forest were either damaged or felled by Leslie.[98] In Soure, damage was estimated to be at least \u20ac1,000,000 (US$1,208,000),[99] with around \u20ac600,000 (US$725,000) in damage being to sports infrastructure alone. Schools in the town were closed due to damage and power outages.[100] Around 90 percent of the homes in 8 parishes were damaged by Leslie.[101] The storm broke tiles on several streets and knocked down trees. A pavilion was deroofed in the village of Sim\u00f5es. Municipal authorities dispensed generators to multiple towns in the Soure municipality.[79] In the Mira Municipality, regions were left without potable water, power, and outside contact for over a week. At least 5,000 homes sustained damage during the storm.[102] Equipment and greenhouses also sustained damage.[103] A hospital and firestation in Mira lost power during the storm; power was not restored until 14 October. Eight schools were closed in the municipality, due to a lack of water and power.[104] The Equestrian Center of Montemor-o-Velho was almost entirely destroyed by the storm.[105] A nursing home and a pavilion in Montemor-o-Velho were both deroofed. Another pavilion suffered damage to its supports, rendering it unusable. Pools were damaged in Condeixa-a-Nova, and three families were left homeless.[93] The power company EDP declared a state of emergency in Coimbra, as a result of damage to electrical infrastructure. A number of high voltage power poles were either felled or bent by the storm.[99] At least 4,000 transformers were damaged by the storm.[102] Several buildings owned by the University of Coimbra suffered damage to their ceilings.[79] The university stadium and a botanical garden also sustained damage, while a radio tower was toppled during the storm.[102] Over a dozen streets were blocked by fallen trees. The electric traction of trolleys was severely impaired across several streets in Coimbra, greatly restricting the availability of service.[106] Scaffolding and signage were damaged across the municipality. National Road 1 was closed in two places between Mealhada and Coimbra due to fallen trees.[107] In Senhor da Serra, solar panels used to power a school were damaged, which caused the school to close for a day. A sanctuary, a chapel, and seven greenhouses received roof damage. A sports field and over a dozen homes were also damaged.[108]",
      "Leiria District[edit]": "In the Bu\u00e7aco National Forest, Leslie left 60 people in the Palace Hotel and another 14 in houses cut off from the outside world for days.[109] A man was injured in the Marinha Grande Municipality, Leira district, when a door was blown off a structure and struck him.[89] In the municipality, a lighthouse was deroofed by the storm. A hotel had a window broken, a balcony destroyed, and suffered damage to its swimming pool and waterpark. Nearly 100 residences in the municipality sustained damage.[110] The roof of Maritime Police facility was lifted away, and the structure had multiple walls destroyed. A restaurant was destroyed at Praia do Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o.[111] Winds blew away tents at the Praia da Vieira, prompting the evacuation of 60 people.[89] Damage in the municipality was estimated to be \u20ac5\u00a0million (US$6.1\u00a0million).[95][112] Around 50 campers were evacuated in Alcoba\u00e7a. The A17 highway connecting Leiria to Aveiro was closed due to fallen trees. A gas leak also occurred at a restaurant.[93] Four parishes in Pombal municipality lacked power and water, and communication services were cut. A school was closed due to a lack of power. In the parish of Louri\u00e7al, powerlines and trees had fallen in several locations.[113]",
      "Aveiro and Porto Districts[edit]": "The European women's roller hockey championship, which was taking place in Mealhada, was stopped in its final minutes after the roof of the sports facility was damaged, windows shattered, and debris littered the track.[81][114][115] Players took refuge in locker rooms.[116] Shipyards and a pavilion were damaged in Mealhada municipality, and a cafeteria sustained damage in Alameda municipality.[117] A blackout occurred in Porto on a street in Trofa after a street light toppled over.[89] Two metro stations and several pavilions were utilized as shelters for the homeless in Lisbon during the storm.[62][64] Around 30 residences were left without power in Valongo after a high-voltage power pole toppled.[93] The Mestra Silva sank off the coast of Esmoriz during the storm, killing one and leaving another three missing; the captain of the ship was rescued and hospitalized.[118]",
      "Other districts[edit]": "Leslie brought wind gusts of 100\u2013120\u00a0km/h (62\u201375\u00a0mph) to the Madeira archipelago.[119] A vault at the Convento da Sauda\u00e7\u00e3o in \u00c9vora partially collapsed due to strong winds from Leslie.[120] A 300-year-old ash tree near the Largo da Miseric\u00f3rdia sustained damage during the storm.[121] Scaffolding attached to buildings collapsed in Lisbon.[122] One person was killed by a falling tree in Amieiro.[123] At least 70 trees fell and 73 structures were damaged in Viseu municipality.[93] Strong waves from Leslie deposited sand at the entrance to the Albufeira Lagoon as the storm moved ashore. Following the storm, water current velocities were greatly diminished for multiple weeks, causing the lagoon's entrance to close entirely by 9 November.[124]",
      "Spain[edit]": "Leslie brought torrential rainfall and flooding to the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha, the Balearic Islands, and Valencia.[125] The storm caused at least 17 injuries across Spain. Heavy rainfall caused the Si\u00f3 river to overflow in Catalonia.[126] At least 45 landslides occurred in the region. Around 247 firefighters responded to over 1,000 emergency calls in Catalonia.[127] In Castilla y Le\u00f3n, 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) winds downed trees and branches on roads in dozens of locations.[128] The R1, R2, and R11 lines of the Rodalies de Catalunya and five roads, including the C-17 highway in Barcelona, were closed as a result of fallen trees.[129][130] Girona and Barcelona experienced 14,000 power outages and 12 roads were impassable due to floodwaters; the latter forced the suspension of school transportation services for six municipalities. A gas station roof was blown off in the Malgrat del Mar neighborhood in Barcelona. Six people had to be evacuated from surrounding properties when a building collapsed in Tortosa.[126] Over 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) of rain fell in Montseny, and 209.3\u00a0mm (8.24\u00a0in) of rain fell in Viladrau.[131] Strong winds caused a wall to collapse in Santo \u00c1ngel, forcing the closure of a road. The Albuj\u00f3n highway was closed in Cartagena, due to the storm. A fair was canceled in Avenida de Los Toreros after a tree fell and roofs of two stalls were ripped off. The Toledo Cathedral sustained damage to its cornice, with a 20\u00a0kg (44\u00a0lb) piece falling off.[65][132] A tunnel flooded in Beniaj\u00e1n, trapping a vehicle.[133] Several skates turned upside down in El Prat de Llobregat, and in Palomares, the masts of two skates were snapped and another was bent. Detritus plant matter and other dregs were swept onto the Sant Salvador beach by the storm, covering most of it.[134] An Algerian Kilo-class submarine and its accompanying tugboat, Al Moussif, anchored in the Spanish-controlled Ares Estuary during the storm.[135] An electrical cable snapped in Zamora, sparking a ditch fire and leaving 390 residences without power.[132][136] A crane toppled over, striking a building in Soria.[132]",
      "France[edit]": "After the storm, victims in the Aude proceeded to shelters or lodged with their neighbors, and schools were closed.[181] Around 700 firefighters, 160 police officers, and rescue agencies took part in cleanup and rescue operations in the department.[138][182][183] Seven helicopters and one plane were mobilized for search and rescue missions in the Aude.[138] Authorities responded to at least 250 emergencies.[184] The French Insurance Federation recorded 35,000 claims of damage in regards to the floods caused by Leslie, with 27,000 of those occurring in the Aude. Collectively, \u20ac17\u00a0million (US$20\u00a0million) in advances were paid to claimants.[185]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "The Alta, a freighter ship, experienced an unrepairable mechanical issue. The United States Coast Guard and the crew considered towing the ship, but ultimately abandoned it due to the nearby Hurricane Leslie. The ship ran ashore in Ireland on 16 February 2020.[149] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France issued a yellow alert for the overseas territory of Martinique on 3 October due to high surf generated by Leslie. The highest surf experienced in Martinique was 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) in the Dominica Channel.[150] From late September through early October, Leslie brought high surf to the East Coast of the United States, inducing the highest swell observed in some locations for years. Leslie also generated the single-longest period of tropical swells observed in the Outer Banks in the last 20 years, producing surf at chest height or higher. The highest surf was observed on 26\u201328 September, when Leslie was a powerful extratropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds.[151] Leslie and a low-pressure system inhibited a trough from tracking eastward from 29 to 30 September, causing fog to persist for 32 hours in Ferryland, Newfoundland.[152]",

      "2006\u20132008 Southeastern United States drought": "The 2006\u201308 Southeastern United States drought was a crippling drought that struck the southeast of the U.S. Several reasons, including an unusually strong Bermuda high pressure and La Ni\u00f1a in the eastern Pacific Ocean (which causes dry conditions across the southern U.S.) were responsible for the drought. 2007 was particularly dry across the region, with rivers and lakes dropping to record-low levels.[1]",
      "Formation[edit]": "The drought was set in motion by the weather phenomenon La Ni\u00f1a which developed during 2005. La Ni\u00f1a caused dry weather across much of the Southeast, this was evident due to the fact that winter 2005\u201306 was dry for much of the region.[2] On top of that, the Bermuda High, also known as the Azores High, a hot and dry air mass over the Atlantic, formed unusually far west, and blocked storms from entering the region, a pattern that wouldn't break until 2008.[3] The dryness continued into 2006. However, it was mild in comparison in 2007 and did not cause too many effects.[4] Following that, 2007 was very dry across the Southeastern U.S. receiving record-low rainfall during the year. Mississippi and Georgia each had their driest spring on record, where spring typically is very wet across the region.[5] The following summer was scorching hot and dry across the region with record-breaking wildfires across the region. In fact, August 2007 would end up being the warmest August and second-hottest month of any month across the region. with Knoxville, Tennessee having a daily maximum temperature above 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) on 16 days that month, and an all-time record.. High temperatures were still in the 90s \u00b0F (32+ \u00b0C) as far late as the end of October.[6] The drought peaked in October, with over 70%  of the Southeast in D4 or the worst category of drought, known as exceptional. 2007 would be the second-driest year as a whole over the region. North Carolina had its driest calendar year ever; several towns nearly ran out of water.[7] Recovery The Bermuda High retreated out into the Atlantic and heavy winter rains during 2007\u201308 helped alleviate drought, a wet 2008 improved drought across most of the region; however, parts of Western North Carolina remained in drought until 2009.[8]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "It is estimated that the drought caused an economic loss over the region at $1.3 billion and water shortages caused the first importing of water in 100 years, and crops failed across the region, causing catastrophic impacts.[9]",

      "Cyclone Steve": " Tropical Cyclone Steve was a tropical cyclone that affected northern Australia from 27 February 2000 until 11 March 2000. Cyclone Steve was noted for its longevity and traversal of northern and western Australia. It impacted on regions of northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia before clearing to the south of the continent. Steve is the first known Australian cyclone to make four distinct landfalls in the country.[1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical low formed in the Coral Sea to the east of Willis Island on 25 February 2000. The system rapidly intensified to become Tropical Cyclone Steve at around 7\u00a0am Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) (UTC+10) on 27 February 2000. The cyclone crossed the Queensland coast as a Category\u00a02 system on 27 February to the north of Cairns at around 7\u00a0pm AEST. Steve weakened slowly over land and was downgraded to a tropical low on 28 February. The low tracked westward and re-intensified to tropical cyclone strength over the Gulf of Carpentaria on the same day at around 10\u00a0pm AEST. The cyclone passed over Mornington Island in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria and crossed the Northern Territory coast north of Port McArthur on 1 March as a Category\u00a01. The cyclone weakened back to a tropical low again, but maintained a strong low to middle-level circulation as it crossed the base of the Top End of the Northern Territory. The low moved just south of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf into the Kimberley region of Western Australia and reformed once again into a tropical cyclone just west of Broome on 5 March at 1\u00a0pm Australian Western Standard Time (AWST) (UTC+8). Cyclone Steve moved in a west southwest direction parallel to the Pilbara coast and strengthened further during the day and was upgraded to a Category\u00a02 system early on 6 March. The cyclone deepened to a pressure of 975\u00a0hPa during the day. Continuing on its path to the southwest, Steve passed north of Port Hedland and Karratha on 6 March, before crossing the Pilbara coast near Mardie around midnight on 6 March (Steve's third landfall). The system was again downgraded to Category\u00a01 as it moved inland. At around midnight on 7 March, Steve again moved offshore about 175 kilometres (109\u00a0mi) north of Carnarvon and moved southwards along the coast. However, the system did not intensify further beyond Category\u00a01 and made its final (fourth) landfall at around midnight on 9 March east of Denham. Steve then continued to track to the south-east and increased in speed across southern parts of Western Australia during the 10 and 11 March and becoming extra-tropical, before moving offshore for the final time to the east of Esperance late on 11 March and over the waters of the Great Australian Bight.[2][3]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Queensland[edit]": "As Steve tracked inland on the north Queensland coast, it caused major flooding between Cairns and Mareeba. A record flood level of 12.4\u00a0m (41\u00a0ft) was reached at Mareeba on 28 February 2000. Many buildings in Cairns suffered severe water damage including the Cairns Hospital. Cairns recorded its wettest February on record with the suburb of Manunda measuring 1,462.7\u00a0mm (57.59\u00a0in) and Bartle Frere recording 3,376\u00a0mm (132.9\u00a0in).[1] Wind gusts up to 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) caused several buildings in Cairns and Kuranda to lose their roofs. Hundreds of trees were uprooted and powerlines were brought down throughout the district, disrupting supplies to more than 40,000 residents. In Cairns, a giant fig tree was uprooted with the entire root system out of the ground. Crop damage by floods and winds was severe, with the sugar cane damage alone estimated at A$20\u00a0million. Early estimates indicate that the total damage bill in north Queensland associated with Cyclone Steve may exceed A$100\u00a0million.[4]",
      "Northern Territory[edit]": "Severe winds squalls and heavy rainfall was recorded across the Top End. Several trees were uprooted in Gunbalanya (Oenpelli) which reported winds gusts in excess of 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph). Gusts near 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) in Darwin overnight on 2 March brought down trees. Widespread flooding resulted in the Katherine, Daly and Victoria River regions. Water levels in the Katherine River came to within about 3 metres (9.8 feet) of those experienced in the 1998 floods but subsided without inundating the town.[1] Rainfall across the Top End, Victoria River region over a four-day period between 29 February to 4 March was between 200 and 400 millimetres (7.9 and 15.7 inches). Similar totals were recorded over four days in the Kimberley region. Numerous Northern Territory roads and highways were cut with many communities isolated.[4]",
      "Western Australia[edit]": "Near gale-force winds were experienced at Port Hedland for a period of about 17\u00a0hours beginning at midnight AWST on 5 March. The peak hourly average wind speed recorded was 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) and the maximum gust recorded was 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) (between 8 and 9\u00a0am AWST 6 March). Winds averaged near 70\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) at Karratha in the early evening 6 March and the maximum gust recorded was 98\u00a0km/h (61\u00a0mph) at 6\u00a0pm AWST.[3] The very heavy rainfall associated with Steve produced widespread flooding in northern parts of the state, including the Gascoyne region. Communities in the Kimberley region which remained isolated for more than two weeks required food and supply air-drops. Low-lying areas of the Carnarvon townsite were flooded when the Gascoyne River breached its banks. The Gascoyne River at Carnarvon reached its highest level since 1960. Parts of the western Pilbara and northern Gascoyne received totals that ranged from 200 to 300\u00a0mm. Several sites reported highest on record daily rainfall amounts including Mandora (281.0\u00a0mm on 6th) and Mount Narryer (152.0\u00a0mm on 10th). Carnarvon (100.6\u00a0mm on 9th) reported its highest March daily rainfall since records commenced at the airport in 1945.[5] Rainfall ranging from 50 to 100\u00a0mm continued over inland parts extending in a south-easterly direction from the west Gascoyne to the south coast near Esperance. Flooding occurred in the Esperance area and number of roads and bridges were washed away. Salmon Gums Research Station recorded 91\u00a0mm of rain on 11 March.[2]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "The name Steve was removed from the official list of tropical cyclone names set out by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane.[6] It was replaced with the name Stan.[7]",

      "Cyclone Trina": " Tropical Cyclone Trina (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 01F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 06P) was a weak but destructive tropical cyclone in late 2001 which caused some of the worst flooding in the South Pacific island of Mangaia, Cook Islands, in nearly 50\u00a0years. Forming out of an upper-level low pressure system on November\u00a029 near the island of Rarotonga, or roughly 1,470\u00a0mi (2,365\u00a0km) southeast of Fiji, Trina remained practically stationary as it meandered in the same general area for over a week. Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, the storm struggled to develop significant convection, preventing it from intensifying beyond 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). After finally succumbing to wind shear on December\u00a02, the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later. As a result of the cyclone's slow movement, heavy rains impacted the same area for more than a week, resulting in severe flooding. Throughout Mangaia, nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of the livestock perished. Following an assessment of the damage, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses. Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was retired in May 2002 and replaced with Tino.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Tropical Cyclone Trina was identified by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), on November\u00a018, 2001 as an upper-level low west of Rarotonga, an island situated roughly 2,355\u00a0km (1,465\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Fiji. Little development took place over the following ten days as the low gradually made its way to the surface.  Situated in a region of relatively low wind shear, the system acquired subtropical characteristics before deep convection formed around its center.[1] Late on November\u00a029, the FMS upgraded the low to a tropical depression and assigned it the identifier 01F.[2] However, the system later entered an area unfavorable to tropical cyclogenesis, consisting of increasing shear and marginally warm sea surface temperatures, estimated between 26 and 27\u00a0\u00b0C (79 and 81\u00a0\u00b0F). Drifting westward, convection managed to increase despite unfavorable conditions, as the low passed roughly 45\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) southwest of Rarotonga on November\u00a030.[1] Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, stating a \"good\" chance of the system becoming a tropical cyclone within 48\u00a0hours. Although the center remained partially devoid of convective activity,[3] the system was declared Tropical Depression 06P by the agency within hours of the alert.[4] Later on November\u00a030, the depression further intensified into a tropical cyclone and was given the name Trina by the FMS. At this time, gale-force winds were only present in one quadrant of the storm. In previous years, gale-force winds had to be present all around the center for the system to receive a name. Upon receiving its name, Trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.38\u00a0inHg).[1][5] Remaining nearly stationary, Trina succumbed to strong wind shear during the evening of November\u00a030.[1] The JTWC only classified Trina as a tropical storm for 12\u00a0hours before downgrading the system and issuing their final advisory early on December\u00a01.[3][4] However, according to the FMS, the system retained gale-force winds through December\u00a02, by which time it was situated about 70\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) northwest of Mangaia. Now significantly displaced from any convective activity, the remnants of Trina persisted in the same general area for several more days before completely dissipating.[1]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "Following Tropical Depression 01F's upgrade to Tropical Cyclone Trina on November\u00a030, the Cook Islands were placed under a cyclone alert.[6] Gale warnings were also put in place for the islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia for several days.[7] Air New Zealand flights and many social events were canceled to ensure public safety.[8] Due to the low intensity of the storm, the main threat was not wind damage, although gusts up to 100\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) were reported in Rarotonga.[6] Owing to the slow movement of the storm, heavy rains associated with Trina fell on Mangaia for nearly eight days, resulting in widespread flooding.[9] Parts of the island were inundated with up to 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) of water, destroying nearly 95% of the taro crop and drowning numerous livestock. Several of the islands' main roads were washed out and a few reports of landslides were made.[7] The flooding on Mangaia was regarded as the worst in almost 50\u00a0years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due to the amount of soil being washed out to sea.[10] Despite initial reports that the local water supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents.[9] Offshore, a sailboat was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and was on the verge of sinking. The sailor managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore.[11] The flooding on Mangaia persisted for nearly a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, the full extent of damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National Disaster Management Council, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from the United Nations was eventually requested on December\u00a012, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply.[12] A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the United Nations to assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm.[13] By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands.[14] In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal and cleanup was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents.[15] Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was later retired.[16]",

      "Cyclone Ockhi": " Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Ockhi[nb 1] was a strong tropical cyclone that devastated parts of Sri Lanka and India in 2017, and was the most intense tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea since Cyclone Megh in 2015. The ninth depression, and the third and strongest named storm of the 2017 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Ockhi originated from an area of low pressure that formed over the southwest Bay of Bengal on November 28.[2] The storm organized into a Depression off southeast coast of Sri Lanka on November 29, causing damage to property and life in Sri Lanka while passing by.[2] Due to high atmospheric moisture and warmer oceanic surface temperature between Sri Lanka and Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) in mainland India, Ockhi intensified into a cyclonic storm on November 30.[2] While near Kanyakumari in mainland India, Ockhi changed course and intensified while heading towards Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.[3] Ockhi impacted Lakshadweep on December 2, uprooting coconut trees and causing extensive damage to houses, power lines and other infrastructure on the islands.[4] Ockhi weakened into a well-marked low near the south coast of Gujarat, India, on December 6, before crossing the coastline and dissipating shortly afterward.[5] In its entirety, Ockhi left a trail of massive destruction in Sri Lanka, Lakshadweep, South India, and The Maldives, as it strengthened from a depression to a mature cyclone. Though it rapidly weakened during its final stages over the Arabian Sea, it caused heavy rainfall along the western coast of India, particularly in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Ockhi caused at least 245 fatalities, including 218 in India[6] and 27 in Sri Lanka,[7] and the storm left at least 550 people missing, mainly fishermen.[8]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On November 28, an area of low pressure from the remnant energy of Tropical Storm Kirogi developed about 425\u00a0km (265\u00a0mi) to the south-southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka.[9][2][10] The disturbance was located within an area of warm sea surface temperatures and moderate to strong vertical wind shear, with atmospheric convection scattered around the disturbance's ill-defined low-level circulation center.[10] On November 29, the storm organized into a depression just off the southeastern coast of Sri Lanka, and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) gave the system the identifier BOB 07.[11] Due to the storm's rapidly consolidating low level circulation center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, shortly before classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 03B on November 29.[12] The IMD followed suit, upgrading the storm to a Deep Depression, and soon afterwards to Cyclonic Storm Ockhi.[13] The storm tracked along Sri Lanka's southwestern and western coastline, towards the west-northwest, around the southern verge of a subtropical ridge located over India.[14] Owing to highly favorable conditions, the storm displayed a thick convective ring, surrounding a well-defined eye feature on the same day.[15] The storm tracked westwards and intensified further into a Severe Cyclone Storm early on December 1.[16] Soon afterwards, Ockhi intensified further into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm.[17] As Ockhi moved further into the Arabian Sea, it traveled through an area of sea surface temperatures of 31\u00a0\u00b0C (89\u00a0\u00b0F) and decreasing wind shear; a 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) eye became visible on satellite imagery, prompting the JTWC to upgrade it to a Category 3-equivalent cyclone early on December 2.[18] On December 4, analysis showed that Ockhi was maintaining a source aloft, but there was restricted outflow on the western edge[further explanation needed], due to a deepening trough advancing rapidly from the west.[19] Increasing vertical wind shear along with a deep layered subtropical ridge to the east steered it north-northeast, and a dry air intrusion from the west gradually weakened the system.[20] On the following day, the power of the storm quickly lessened as it encountered increasingly unfavorable conditions, including high wind shear.[21] Dry and cold air from the northern parts of India rapidly weakened the storm, and it was last noted as a well-marked low-pressure area south of the Gulf of Cambay on December 6.[22] Afterward, the remnant of Ockhi crossed over land and dissipated several hours later.[5] During its lifetime as a tropical cyclone, Ockhi traveled a distance of 2,538\u00a0km.[2]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Sri Lanka[edit]": "On December 3, the government allocated Rs 170 million from the national insurance trust fund for relief efforts targeting affected citizens, distributed among each divisional secretariat affected.[61] Rs 10,000 was pledged as an initial allowance for each family affected to a significant degree by Ockhi.[61][62] A parliamentary debate held on the same day saw the government pledge to upgrade the country's meteorological department with an automated network of rain gauges, and announce state compensation for damaged housing and businesses, as well as for domestic appliances damaged by the cyclone or resultant effects, and compensation for lives lost.[62] As of December 4, 2017, the cyclone had caused 26[30] confirmed deaths, with a further 77 injured; the Disaster Management Center reported 123,217 people of 35,354 families in 16 districts as having been affected, with 5,650 individuals of 1,424 displaced families having been provided shelter at 65 emergency welfare centers.[61] 823 houses were reported completely destroyed, with a further 32,347 sustaining damage to varying degrees.[61]",
      "Maldives[edit]": "Several seafaring vessels were capsized on November 30:[26] In all, 14 separate incidents were reported in the Maldivian seas as a result of Ockhi's effects.[26] As of December 3, houses across 62 islands in the Maldives had been damaged by the fringe effects of Ockhi; 36 islands had experienced rain-induced floods while a further 4 had been inundated by storm tides.[26][46] The Maldives National Defence Force was assigned to rescue and flood draining efforts predominantly on islands where the local citizenry could not manage on their own; the police too provided aid.[26][46]",
      "India[edit]": "Kerala and Tamil Nadu sent special rescue teams on December 2 to track missing fishermen who were at sea during the onset of the cyclone, due to protests in coastal areas over the unsatisfactory response from government agencies. Edappadi K. Palaniswami encouraged Rajnath Singh to involve the Navy and Coast Guard in search operations.[63] The Chief Minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, claimed that 400 stranded fishermen were rescued. The government sought a relief package, worth \u20b97,340 crore (US$1.14 billion).[37] Close to 12 boats, housing 138 fishermen in total, arrived at Kalpeni, while four other boats arrived at Androth, Kithan and Chatlet, all of which were in Lakshadweep. Lakshadweep experienced massive coastal erosion, power disruption, extensive damage to property and water shortages. People were provided with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief by the Indian Navy in Lakshadweep. The navy transported relief material to Minicoy, Kavaratti, and Kalpeni on Sunday.[64] 4 tonnes of material, including rice, dal, salt and potatoes, water, blankets, raincoats, disposable clothes, mosquito nets and dhurries, were given to the local government. It was reported that dry provisions and ready to eat meals were also being transported to Bitra Island by helicopter from Dweeprakshak base in the island of Kavaratti. The government claimed the relief material would last for a week for 2,000 people.[65] Tamil Nadu's government stated on December 6 that as many as 4,501 houses in Cyclone Ockhi-hit Kanyakumari had suffered partial and full damage and relief to the tune of \u20b941 lakh had been provided. A government release quoted 1,687 houses had been damaged completely while 2,814 houses had suffered partial damage.[66] The government asked for a relief of \u20b99,302 crore (US$1.44 billion).[34] According to government officials, about 33,000 people from Kerala and another 2,800 from Tamil Nadu were affected by the cyclone as of November 30, 2017. The Centre Government reported that 39 people had died and 167 were missing, after the cyclone hit parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Authorities conducted rescue operations that attempted to locate the missing people in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Lakshadweep. An estimated number of 74 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and 93 from Kerala were missing. The Chief Minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, declared a compensation of \u20b920 lakh to the families of those who died and \u20b95 lakh to those who were permanently disabled due to the cyclone. He also announced that fishermen and their children will be paid \u20b960 and \u20b9 45 as an allowance for a week along with free food and rations for the residents of the coastal villages for a period of a month.[67]",

      "Aftermath[edit]": "",
      "Government controversy[edit]": "Chief Minister of Kerala complained to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he had a negligent attitude towards states ruled by the Left.[68] The complaint was that in the matter of Ockhi and the natural calamity that followed, the centre had a different attitude.[68] The Centre inquired with Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister about the situation but did not inquire about Kerala.[68] Fishermen and their families protested and did not allow Vijayan's car to pass through during his visit of Vizhinjam, a fishing village near Thiruvananthapuram.[69] The protesters claimed that the Government of Kerala was late in issuing warning to the fishermen on November 29, when the cyclone was in depression state near Sri Lanka. The Kerala Disaster Management Authority blamed the India Meteorological Department, claiming that they had only issued a fishing advisory, and not a warning.[69] Sekhar Kuriakose, the member secretary of the Kerala Disaster Management Authority, claimed in a press statement on December 1 that it was not possible for the MET department to issue a cyclone warning on November 29, as the cyclone was still a deep depression on November 30 until noon.",

      "Contents": "",
      "Hurricane Bob (1979)": " Hurricane Bob was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone to be officially designated using a masculine name after the discontinuation of Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet names.[1] Bob brought moderate damage to portions of the United States Gulf Coast and areas farther inland in July\u00a01979. The storm was the first hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico to form in the month of July since 1959, and was the fifth tropical cyclone to form during the annual hurricane season. Though the origin of Bob can be traced back to a tropical wave near the western coast of Africa in late June, Bob formed from a tropical depression in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on July\u00a09. Tracking in a general northward direction, favorable conditions allowed for quick strengthening. Less than a day after formation, the system reached tropical storm intensity, followed by hurricane intensity on July\u00a011. Shortly after strengthening into a hurricane, Bob reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.12\u00a0inHg).[nb 1] At the same intensity, Bob made landfall west of Grand Isle, Louisiana, and rapidly weakened after moving inland. However, the resulting tropical depression persisted for several days as it paralleled the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. On July\u00a016, the system emerged into the western Atlantic, where it was subsequently absorbed by a nearby low-pressure area. Widespread offshore and coastal evacuations took place along the United States Gulf Coast in preparation for Hurricane Bob. Effects from the hurricane on the United States were mostly marginal and typical of a minimal hurricane. The cyclone produced a moderate storm surge, damaging some coastal installments and causing coastal inundation. Strong winds were also associated with Bob's landfall, though no stations observed winds of hurricane force. The winds downed trees and blew out windows, in addition to causing widespread power outages. Heavy rainfall was also reported in some locations, peaking at 7.16\u00a0in (182\u00a0mm) in Louisiana. Further inland, the torrential rains led to flooding in Indiana, resulting in more considerable damage as opposed to the coast. Bob also spawned eight tornadoes, with two causing significant damage. Overall, Bob was responsible for one death and $20\u00a0million in damage.[nb 2]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origin of Hurricane Bob can be traced to a tropical wave that was first located near Cape Verde towards the end of June. The disturbance tracked westward with minimal signs of development, and reached the northwestern Caribbean Sea on July\u00a06. The following day, the tropical system tracked across the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula the following day, and upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, the cluster of storms began to develop a weak circulation center. This enabled for more rapid tropical cyclogenesis,[2] and at 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a09, the disturbance was analyzed to have organized into a tropical depression[3]\u00a0\u2013 the third of such in the Atlantic that year. The depression strengthened rather quickly, and on the morning of July\u00a010 a United States Air Force reconnaissance flight indicated that the tropical cyclone had strengthened to tropical storm intensity while situated 740\u00a0mi (1,190\u00a0km) south of Louisiana.[2] Due to the storm's intensity, the system was consequentially named Bob, making it the first Atlantic tropical cyclone to receive a masculine name since 1952.[1][4] At the time the flight measured a minimum barometric pressure of 998\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.47\u00a0inHg).[3] Upon reaching tropical storm intensity, Bob began to curve further northward as opposed to its prior, northeasterly track, due to the presence of a strengthening, upper-level trough to the storm's west. The trough greatly enhanced atmospheric conditions around Bob, allowing for the tropical cyclone to intensify rapidly.[2] At 0000\u00a0UTC on July\u00a011,[3] Bob was estimated to have strengthened to hurricane intensity based on additional reconnaissance flight data.[2] This made Bob the first July hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Debra in 1959.[5] Though the hurricane's maximum sustained winds would hold steady at 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) for approximately the ensuing twelve hours, the storm's barometric pressure would fluctuate before reaching a minimum of 981\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.98\u00a0inHg) at 1200\u00a0UTC that day; this would be Bob's lowest documented barometric pressure. At around the same time, the hurricane made landfall west of Grand Isle, Louisiana.[2] After moving inland, Bob quickly weakened due to land interaction, and was a mere tropical depression by July\u00a012.[3] However, the resulting depression would maintain its intensity for the next several days. On July\u00a013, the low-pressure area drifted into southern Ohio and afterwards curved eastward. On July\u00a016, Bob's remnants moved into the western Atlantic, where they were subsequently absorbed by another low-pressure area.[2]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "As Bob moved towards the U.S. Gulf Coast, the National Weather Service issued gale warnings for coastal regions extending from Vermilion Bay, Louisiana to Biloxi, Mississippi at 1600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a010. These warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings upon Bob's strengthening to such an intensity. During the storm's existence, forecasts and predictions from the National Hurricane Center were of greater accuracy than on average.[5] In addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches, the agency also advised small craft from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida to remain in port.[6] In preparation for the storm, 8,000\u00a0offshore oil workers were evacuated.[6] Despite typical evacuation procedure, Chevron Corporation immediately evacuated their offshore oil staff rather than executing a three phase evacuation plan.[7] On land, 2,500\u00a0residents and tourists on Grand Isle were also evacuated.[6] In total, as many as 80,000\u00a0people evacuated from coastal areas leading up to Bob's eventual landfall. In New Orleans, 4,000\u00a0people checked into the city's 19\u00a0evacuation centers. The Mississippi River was temporarily closed to shipping by the United States Coast Guard for eight hours before reopening after the storm.[8]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Effects in the United States as a result of Bob were typical of a minimal hurricane, and were not of considerable nature. At the coast, Bob caused moderate storm surge, resulting in coastal waters rising to as high as 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) above normal. The rough seas sunk several boats and caused significant damage to piers.[2] A levee on Grand Isle was breached by the surge, resulting in some coastal inundation. Minor beach erosion occurred on the coast of Mississippi. In Mobile County, Alabama, the wave action damaged cars near the shore and disrupted seafood operations in the Bayou La Batre area.[9] Strong winds were reported in association with the storm, but no station documented sustained winds within hurricane force. The highest wind observation was taken on an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana, which clocked sustained winds at 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h). However, the strongest wind gust in association with the hurricane was measured in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, at 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h).[5] In New Orleans, these strong winds damaged trees and power lines, and also broke several windows in the city's central business district.[10] In addition, widespread power outages impacted 53,000\u00a0electricity customers in the city's area. Similar incidents took place in Houma, Louisiana.[8] In Lafitte, Louisiana, two men were blown off of the roof of a marina, and one of them was killed; this would be the only death associated with the hurricane.[2] Further east, in Florida, trees and power lines were downed in Niceville.[9] Hurricane Bob also produced a widespread area of rain that was heavy in localized areas.[11] Rainfall associated with the hurricane peaked at 7.16\u00a0in (182\u00a0mm) in Louisiana, where the storm made landfall. Statewide rainfall totals peaked at 6.64 and 4.81\u00a0in (169 and 122\u00a0mm) in Pascagoula, Mississippi and Robertsdale, Alabama, respectively.[12] Further inland, the remnants of Bob dropped heavy rainfall in the Midwestern United States, peaking at 5.72\u00a0in (145\u00a0mm) at a station in Indiana University Bloomington.[13] In addition to the strong winds and heavy rain, Bob produced eight tornadoes across the southern United States. One of these tornadoes caused $27,500\u00a0in damage after striking areas of Biloxi, Mississippi.[2] Another tornado impacted areas near Red Level, Alabama destroying or damaging several buildings and uprooting trees.[9] Overall, Hurricane Bob caused approximately $20\u00a0million in damage. However, $15\u00a0million in damage resulted from flooding in Indiana, with the rest of the storm's monetary impacts arising from coastal regions.[5]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Cyclone Idai": " Intense Tropical Cyclone Idai (/\u026a\u02c8da\u026a, \u02c8i\u02d0da\u026a/) was one of the worst tropical cyclones on record to affect Africa and the Southern Hemisphere.[4] The long-lived storm caused catastrophic damage, and a humanitarian crisis in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, leaving more than 1,500\u00a0people dead and many more missing. Idai is the deadliest tropical cyclone recorded in the South-West Indian Ocean basin. In the Southern Hemisphere, which includes the Australian, South Pacific, and South Atlantic basins, Idai ranks as the second-deadliest tropical cyclone on record. The only system with a higher death toll is the 1973 Flores cyclone that killed 1,650 off the coast of Indonesia.[5][6] The tenth named storm, seventh tropical cyclone, and seventh intense tropical cyclone of the 2018\u201319 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Idai originated from a tropical depression that formed off the east coast of Mozambique on 4 March 2019. The storm, Tropical Depression 11, made landfall in Mozambique later in the day and remained a tropical depression through its five-day trek over land. On 9 March, the depression re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel and strengthened into Moderate Tropical Storm Idai on the next day. Idai then began a stint of rapid intensification, reaching an initial peak intensity as an intense tropical cyclone, with sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on 11 March. Idai then began to weaken, due to ongoing structural changes within its inner core, falling to tropical cyclone intensity. Idai's intensity remained stagnant for about a day or so before it began to re-intensify. On 14 March, Idai reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg). Idai then began to weaken as it approached the coast of Mozambique, due to less favourable conditions, weakening below intense tropical cyclone status later that day. On 15 March, Idai made landfall near Beira, Mozambique, subsequently weakening into a remnant low on 16 March. Idai's remnants slowly continued inland for another day, before reversing course and turning eastward on 17 March. On 19 March, Idai's remnants re-emerged into the Mozambique Channel and eventually dissipated on 21 March.[7][8] Idai brought strong winds and caused severe flooding in Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, which killed at least 1,593\u00a0people[9] \u2013 and affected more than 3\u00a0million others.[10] Catastrophic damage occurred in and around Beira in central Mozambique. The President of Mozambique stated that more than 1,000\u00a0people may have died in the storm.[11] A major humanitarian crisis unfolded in the wake of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe. In the former nation, rescuers were forced to let some people die in order to save others.[12] A cholera outbreak ensued in the storm's wake, with more than 4,000\u00a0confirmed cases and seven fatalities by 10\u00a0April. Total damages from Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Malawi were estimated to be around $3.3\u00a0billion (2019 USD),[13][10] with US$1\u00a0billion alone in infrastructure damages, making Idai the costliest tropical cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean basin.[14][15][16][17]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Cyclone Idai originated from an elongated circulation that the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France office in R\u00e9union (MFR) began monitoring on 1 March. At that time, it was in the Mozambique Channel and was moving west-southwest, towards Africa's east coast.[18] The MFR continued to track the system over the next couple of days as it developed strong deep convection.[19] On 4 March, the MFR stated that Tropical Depression\u00a011 had formed off the east coast of Mozambique.[20] The depression slowly moved westward, making landfall in Mozambique later in the day.[21] The system retained its status as a tropical depression through its existence over land. Shortly after landfall, the system turned to the north. Over the next several days, Tropical Depression 11 performed a counterclockwise loop near the border of Malawi and Mozambique,[22] before turning eastward and re-emerging into the Mozambique Channel, early on 9 March.[23] On 8 March, at 22:00 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), noting a consolidating low-level circulation center and that the system was in a favourable environment with low wind shear and sea surface temperatures exceeding 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[24] On 9 March, after Tropical Depression 11 had re-entered the Mozambique Channel, the JTWC issued its first warning on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 18S.[25] At 00:00 UTC on 10 March, the MFR upgraded the system to a moderate tropical storm and designated it as Idai, after an increase in organised convection and the development of banding features.[26] Idai then began a period of rapid intensification, with the MFR upgrading it to tropical cyclone status by 18:00 UTC. At the same time, the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[27] Additionally, the strengthening of a subtropical ridge to the southwest and the weakening of the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the north resulted in a decrease in the forward motion of the storm.[28] Around 12:00 UTC on 11 March, Idai reached its initial peak intensity as an intense tropical cyclone, the seventh storm of that intensity that season, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph). At that time, the MFR reported that the internal structure of the cyclone had improved, with an eye visible in infrared imagery.[29] Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), the equivalent of a Category 4 major hurricane, although operationally, the JTWC classified Idai as a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone.[30] Soon afterward, Idai began a weakening trend as it entered an eyewall replacement cycle and experienced dry air entanglement.[31] It was also noted that Idai was tracking towards the southwest, under the increasing influence of the subtropical ridge to the north.[32] On 12 March at 06:00 UTC, Idai bottomed out at tropical cyclone status with 10-minute winds of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). At that time, the MFR noted that Idai had a poorly defined eye, as the eyewall replacement cycle was still underway.[33] Over the next day, Idai's intensity changed very little due to ongoing structural changes within its inner core. At the same time, Idai began to travel in a westerly direction.[34] By 18:00 UTC on 13 March, Idai had developed a large eye and taken on the characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone.[35] Six hours later, Idai reached peak intensity, with 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 940\u00a0hPa (27.76\u00a0inHg).[36] At that time, the JTWC also reported that Idai had reached peak intensity, with 1-minute sustained winds of 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph).[37] Soon afterward, Idai began to weaken, due to lower sea surface temperatures and vertical wind shear as it neared the coast of Mozambique.[38] At 00:00 UTC on 15 March, the MFR reported that Idai had made landfall near Beira, Mozambique, with 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph).[39] Shortly afterward, the JTWC issued its final warning on Idai, stating that the cyclone had diminishing eyewall convection and warming cloud tops.[40] Idai quickly weakened after landfall; at 06:00 UTC that day, the MFR declared that Idai had degenerated into an overland depression, with gale-force winds as it continued to move inland.[41] Six hours later, the MFR issued its last warning on Idai. At that time, it was forecast that Idai's circulation would persist for several more days, and would drop heavy rainfall throughout the region during that time.[42] The MFR continued to monitor Idai for the next few days, with Idai degenerating into a remnant low late on 16 March. On 17 March, the MFR noted that only a wide clockwise circulation remained over eastern Zimbabwe, though rain from Idai's remnant was still affecting the entire region.[43] On the same day, Idai's remnants turned eastward once again, eventually re-emerging into the Mozambique Channel a second time on 19 March.[44] Idai's remnants encountered unfavourable conditions and rapidly weakened thereafter, dissipating late on 21 March over the Mozambique Channel.[7][8]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Idai caused severe flooding throughout Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe resulting in at least 1,593\u00a0deaths.[9][50][49][46][45][3] More than 3\u00a0million people experienced the direct effects of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands in need of assistance.[51] Infrastructural damage from Idai across these countries totaled at least US$1\u00a0billion.[17]",
      "Mozambique[edit]": "Throughout Mozambique, Idai killed at least 602 people, injured 1,641 others, and inflicted an estimated US$773\u00a0million in damage.[52]",
      "First landfall[edit]": "Flooding from the precursor depression began in Mozambique on 6\u00a0March, primarily affecting north-central provinces. The Niassa, Tete and Zambezia provinces were affected, the latter being hardest-hit.[53] Flooding from the tropical depression killed 66\u00a0people and injured 111 more. It was reported that 5,756\u00a0homes were destroyed, while another 15,467\u00a0homes were affected. Additionally, eight hospitals and 938\u00a0classrooms were destroyed. The floods also ruined 168,000 hectares (420,000 acres) of crops.[1]",
      "Second landfall[edit]": "During its second landfall, Cyclone Idai wrought catastrophic damage across a large swath of central and western Mozambique. Destructive winds devastated coastal communities and flash floods destroyed inland communities in what the World Meteorological Organization termed \"one of the worst weather-related disasters in the southern hemisphere\".[54] At least 532\u00a0people were killed from the combined effects of flooding and wind.[50][2] In Beira, airborne debris caused numerous injuries;[55] in some instances, sheet metal from roofs decapitated people.[56] More than 1,500\u00a0people were treated for storm-related injuries, primarily from airborne debris, in hospitals across Beira.[11] As of 7\u00a0April, assessments indicate the destruction of 111,163\u00a0homes, damage to another 112,735\u00a0houses, and flooding to a further 15,784\u00a0structures.[57][58] An estimated 1.85\u00a0million people were affected by the cyclone.[59] Alongside damage to infrastructure, approximately 711,000\u00a0ha (1,760,000 acres) of crops were damaged or destroyed nationwide. Much of this land near the landfall area was near-harvest, compounding the risk of food shortages and placing the country at high-risk of famine.[59][60] Making landfall in Mozambique near Beira, Idai produced a storm surge of 4.4\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft) in the city. Coupled with torrential rains, including earlier rainfall, disastrous flooding ensued in the region.[61] Officials called the extensive flooded areas \"an inland ocean\"[62] visible even from outer space.[63] More than 500,000\u00a0people in the city, the majority of the population, lost power.[64] Rainfall in the city exceeded 200\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in), while the heaviest totals of more than 600\u00a0mm (24\u00a0in) fell near Chimoio.[61] As of 19 March, 100,000 people were reported as requiring rescue in the Beira area.[65] The IFRC reported that 90% of the area in Beira was totally destroyed.[66] Communications in the city were crippled and all roads out were rendered impassable. All 17 of the city's hospitals and health centers suffered damage.[47] The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies described damage in the region as \"massive and horrifying\" and the President of Mozambique stated that over 1,000\u00a0people may have died. Bodies were found floating in floodwaters in Beira days after the storm hit.[11] A tsunami-like wave of water devastated Nhamatanda, sweeping many people to their deaths and destroying the town. People scrambled to rooftops in order to survive.[12] Days after landfall, the Buzi and Pungwe rivers in central Mozambique overflowed their banks.[67] Unprecedented flooding ensued along the banks of the Buzi River.[60] President Filipe Nyusi stated \"whole villages [disappeared]\" along the Buzi and Pungwe banks. On 17 March, rivers in the western provinces of Mozambique were hit with floodwaters from rising rivers.[68] The city of B\u00fazi continued to flood as of 20 March, placing its 200,000\u00a0residents at high-risk.[69] On 19 March, a 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) section of the Buzi remained flooded.[65] Thousands of people remained trapped on rooftops four days after Idai made landfall.[70] Floodwaters estimated to be 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) submerged entire communities.[71]",
      "Malawi[edit]": "Following its first landfall, Idai brought torrential rains to southeastern Malawi as a tropical depression. These areas saw above-average rainfall in January, enhancing the risk for floods.[72] Widespread flooding began on 9\u00a0March, washing out bridges, roads, and destroying numerous homes.[73] Fourteen districts experienced direct effects from the storm,[72] with Nsanje and Phalombe being hardest-hit.[53] Rising waters overwhelmed flood mitigating infrastructure, causing dams to collapse. Approximately 1,400\u00a0homes were destroyed in Blantyre.[72] After Idai made its second landfall in Mozambique on 15 March, the storm caused even more damage in the region. Two hydroelectric power plants along the Shire River suffered damage and were taken offline, rendering a loss of 270\u00a0MW of Malawi's 320\u00a0MW hydroelectric power capacity.[74] The disaster directly affected 922,900\u00a0people nationwide[75]\u2013an estimated 460,000 being children\u2013125,382 of whom were displaced or rendered homeless.[74] A total of 60\u00a0people were killed[46] and 577\u00a0others were reported injured as a result of flooding.[76][77] A further three people are reported missing.[47]",
      "Madagascar[edit]": "While over the Mozambique Channel, the system brought heavy rains to northwestern Madagascar, with localised accumulations of approximately 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in). Flooding and mudslides in Besalampy killed one person, left two missing, and affected 1,100\u00a0others, as well as damaging 137\u00a0homes.[45][61] Widespread damage occurred to homes, hospitals and schools. Numerous electricity and telephone wires were damaged or destroyed.[78]",
      "Zimbabwe[edit]": "Heavy rains fell across much of eastern Zimbabwe as the cyclone meandered along the nation's border with Mozambique. The heaviest rains fell in the Chimanimani District and Chipinge District, with accumulations reaching 200\u2013400\u00a0mm (8\u201320\u00a0in).[61] Widespread flash flooding ensued, claiming at least 634\u00a0lives,[3] with at least 257 people missing as of 7 April.[49][12] Of these deaths, at least 169 were in Chimanimani.[79] An unknown number of bodies were swept into neighboring areas of Mozambique, and at least 82 were confirmed to have been buried as far as 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) into that nation.[80] At least 232\u00a0people were injured in Chimanimani.[79] An estimated 270,000\u00a0people were affected by the storm.[49] The Chimanimani and Chipinge districts saw extensive damage with widespread flash flooding. To date much of the victims have not fully recovered from the effects of this cyclone. The Nyahonde River burst its banks and inundated numerous communities. Destruction of numerous bridges and roads in eastern Chimanimani isolated many residents.[81] In the town of Chipinge, 600 houses have been destroyed and 20,000 damaged.[65] On 19 March, water overflowed the Marowanyati Dam in Murambinda, along the Mwerahari River.[82]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "",
      "Local aid and response[edit]": "\"Sometimes we can only save two out of five, sometimes we drop food and go to someone else who's in bigger danger... We just save what we can save and the others will perish.\" Ian Scher, head of Rescue South Africa[12] Following the first round of flooding in Mozambique, the government requested MT1.1 billion (US$17.6 million) to provide aid for flood victims.[83] The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis overwhelmed rescuers. In many instances, victims had to be abandoned in fatal conditions in order to save others in more dire need.[12] The National Disasters Management Institute, normally considered capable of handling disasters in Mozambique, could not cope with the scale of the disaster. The agency deployed boats and helicopters to save residents. Inadequate assistance left thousands of victims stranded in trees and on rooftops five days after the cyclone hit. Beira remained largely inaccessible through 20 March with infrastructure devastated and floodwaters yet to recede.[69] The Mozambique Minister of Land and Environment, Celso Correia, stated on 21 March that an estimated 15,000 people still required rescue.[84] A total of 128,941\u00a0people were displaced to 143\u00a0evacuation centers nationwide,[58] often in extremely poor conditions.[85] Three-fourths of the displaced persons reside in Sofala Province where the cyclone made its second landfall.[58] It was reported on 23 March that many local emergency centers in Mozambique had only recently been supplied with food, and some areas remained cut off.[86] Malawi President Peter Mutharika declared a state of emergency for affected districts on 8 March prompting mobilisation of the Malawian Defence Force.[73][72][74] The government estimated $16.4 million was needed to ease the effects of damage due to flooding.[87] Initial estimates placed the number of people in urgent need of aid at 120,000, primarily in the Chikwawa, Nsanje, Zomba, Mulanje, Phalombe, and Mangochi districts. With the support of the Danish Red Cross, the Malawi Red Cross Society provided K18\u00a0million (US$25,000) worth of supplies to displaced persons on 11 March.[88] On 11 March, the Malawi Revenue Authority provided K21\u00a0million (US$29,000) worth of supplies\u2013in the form of 7.5\u00a0tonnes of maize flour, 500 bales of sugar, and 20\u00a0tonnes of salt\u2013and gave a monetary donation of K2\u00a0million (US$3,000).[89] Local officials established 187\u00a0evacuation camps while churches and schools were utilised as makeshift shelters. However, these lacked adequate capacity and many people were forced to sleep in the open. Through 18 March, large portions of Chikwawa and Nsanje districts remained inaccessible by land; helicopters and boats were utilised to deliver supplies to these areas.[74] Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a state of emergency soon after the storm and deployed the National Army and Air Force. A command center was established in Harare by 17 March to co-ordinate rescue and relief efforts. Persistent heavy rain, continued flooding, and mudslides hampered relief efforts, leaving many residents stranded without assistance. Harare Councilor Jacon Mafume called the event a \"serious humanitarian crisis\" and called upon the state for \"intervention on a massive scale to avoid biblical disaster\".[81] The Government of Zimbabwe allocated RTGS$50\u00a0million for emergency response and reconstruction. Medical supplies were sent to Mutare; however, damaged infrastructure hampered distribution. Residents established collection centers in Bulawayo and Harare.[82] Some affected areas remain difficult to reach as of 22 March, including Chimanimani.[90] Mnangagwa declared that Zimbabwe would begin two days of mourning for victims of the cyclone on 23 March.[91] On 4 April 2019, Zimbabwe Cricket announced that all the profits from the third One Day International (ODI) match between Zimbabwe and the United Arab Emirates would go to the relief efforts.[92]",
      "Search for remains[edit]": "Efforts to recover bodies of flood victims proved difficult across Mozambique. Scavenger animals\u2014such as crocodiles, hippos, dogs, snakes, and large pigs\u2014posed the risk of bodies being consumed. In areas with violent flooding, only pieces of corpses were recovered. In one instance Stephen Fonseca, the forensic coordinator for Africa with the Red Cross, found a piece of a spine and a few bones of a child. Fonseca found bodies mangled in treetops where the victims attempted to escape rising waters. Small villages quickly buried the dead, likely without reporting to the government, including those washed in from Zimbabwe. Cadaver dogs were utilized to locate remains across flooded farmlands. The exact death toll is not expected to ever be known between the decomposition of bodies, consumption by animals, and unreported burials. Identification of recovered remains is near impossible due to a lack of forensic records.[93]",
      "Sexual exploitation allegations[edit]": "On 26 April, the United Nations announced that it would be investigating sexual exploitation allegations in the wake of Idai.[94] According to Human Rights Watch, several females were forced to have sexual intercourse with local Mozambican leaders in order to receive food aid.[95][96]",
      "United Nations[edit]": "In Malawi, UNICEF provided various sanitary supplies to residents in Chikwawa, Mangochi, Nsanje, and Phalombe. These included hygiene kits, filtered water bottles, soap, packets of oral rehydration solution, antibiotics for children, and insecticide-treated bednets. Additional supplies were sent to regional hospitals. The agency assessed a long-term need of $8.3\u00a0million to assist women and children.[75] In the immediate aftermath of Idai, UNICEF estimated that about $10\u00a0million was required for the most urgent needs of children in Mozambique.[97] The United Nations and their partners appealed for $40.8\u00a0million as an emergency relief to help those people who were affected by Idai in Mozambique.[98] The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) scrambled to airdrop high-energy biscuits and easy-to-cook food to isolated villages. On 20 March the WFP airlifted 20\u00a0tons of food from Dubai to the region. An Mi-8 transport helicopter contracted through the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service was brought in the same day, with two more expected to be flown in.[99] By 22 March, a total of US$20 million had been made available from the UN's emergency fund,[85] and the UN Secretary General appealed for increased international support, citing food insecurity across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, as well as the need for reconstruction.[100] On 23\u00a0March, the WFP declared the disaster in Mozambique a \"level-three emergency\", the highest level of crisis.[101] This puts it in the same category as the civil wars in Yemen, Syria, and South Sudan.[102]",
      "International aid[edit]": "The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) called the disaster one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history for Mozambique. An estimated 400,000\u00a0people were displaced by the storm and resulting floods. The agency appealed for 10\u00a0million Swiss francs in emergency funds to aid 75,000\u00a0people in dire need of assistance.[103] The French Red Cross transported household items from their warehouse on R\u00e9union within days of the cyclone. With support and funding from the French Government, the agency provided equipment to the Mozambique Red Cross to support relief operations.[59] Three delegates each from the Emirates Red Crescent would be sent to Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.[104] The Portuguese Red Cross deployed a medical and disaster management \"surge team\" ahead of major operations by the IFRC. On 21 March, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would be donating S$121,000 (US$90,000) to aid in relief operations in Mozambique and put a team on standby to assist with disaster response.[105] On 24\u00a0March, the IFRC revised their appeal for Mozambique in light of far greater damage than initially anticipated. The agency requested 31\u00a0million Swiss francs to support 200,000\u00a0victims for 2\u00a0years. Additional personnel, monetary, and disaster risk reduction support was provided by the Turkish Red Crescent, Spanish Red Cross, German Red Cross, and Belgian Red Cross.[59] The South African National Defence Force provided aerial and ground assistance to relief efforts in Malawi and Mozambique starting on 16 March.[106] On 18 March, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom sent \u00a36\u00a0million (US$8\u00a0million) to Mozambique and Malawi as a humanitarian relief.[107] The following day, 7,500\u00a0shelter kits and 100\u00a0family tents arrived in Mozambique to provide temporary housing to displaced persons. A further \u00a312\u00a0million (US$16\u00a0million) worth of food, water, and shelter kits, was provided on 20 March. The country also assisted the WFP in providing food to 140,000\u00a0people through the end of March.[108] On 19 March, the European Union released an emergency aid of \u20ac3.5\u00a0million (US$4\u00a0million) to Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe,[109] The United Arab Emirates sent \u062f.\u0625\u200e18.3\u00a0million (US$5\u00a0million) worth of food, water, and shelter supplies.[104] Norway provided kr6\u00a0million (US$700,000) to World Food Programme.[110] On 22 March, Portugal contributed an aid of \u20ac29,000 (US$33,000) to Manica and Zamb\u00e9zia Province of Mozambique.[111] Ireland will give \u20ac1.05\u00a0million (US$1.2\u00a0million) to the victims of Idai.[112] Canada also distributed C$3.5\u00a0million (US$2.6\u00a0million) to the humanitarian organizations dealing with damage caused by Idai.[113] IsraAid sent personnel to Mozambique to assist in the recovery. Personnel were readied to offer medical supplies, relief supplies, and psychological care to people affected by the storm. Personnel were also prepared to help restore access to safe water.[114] M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res arrived in Beira on 18 March to assess medical needs and treat victims. With clinics and hospitals across the region severely damaged or destroyed or lacking power and water, efforts to treat injuries were hampered.[115] In conjunction with the Red Cross, The Salvation Army worked to provide two meals a day to 500\u00a0families in the city for three weeks beginning on 20 March.[116] CARE Australia started an emergency appeal for funds on 20 March and deployed personnel in the affected nations.[117][118] Two C-130 aircraft from the Portuguese Air Force carrying soldiers, medical personnel, and a disaster relief team left for Mozambique on 21 March.[91] The Indian Navy diverted three ships to the Port of Beira to provide humanitarian assistance.[119] Indian aid forces reported that relief efforts were made more difficult by strong tides, which gave them only \"two-to-three-hour\" intervals to act.[120] By 24\u00a0March, the Government of Morocco deployed four aircraft from the Royal Armed Forces collectively carrying 39\u00a0tons of relief goods.[121]",
      "Disease outbreaks[edit]": "Multiple aid agencies have highlighted the urgent need to supply clean water to people in the area, warning of the risk of disease.[122] Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae[123]), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March.[85] An outbreak of cholera subsequently ensued with 517\u00a0confirmed cases in the Beira area between 24 and 31\u00a0March.[124] The number of confirmed cases exceeded 1,500 by 3\u00a0April.[125] By 10\u00a0April, 4,072\u00a0confirmed cases were recorded with eight fatalities.[126][127] The crowded and poor neighborhoods of the city were at greatest risk for continued spread of cholera. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res reported at least 200\u00a0presumed cases per day. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak.[124] An increase in the incidence of malaria was noted, attributed to malarial mosquitoes breeding in the stagnant water.[85][90] Other potential risks identified include typhoid, another water-borne disease, and diarrheal diseases.[90] At least four people contracted typhoid in Domb\u00e9, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province.[101] Mozambique health officials reported at least 2,700\u00a0cases of diarrhoea by 26\u00a0March.[128] The Red Cross described the risk of major outbreaks in the region as a \"ticking bomb\".[128] The Canadian Red Cross established a field hospital with 53\u00a0tonnes of medical supplies and three land cruisers to distribute aid.[128] The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1\u00a0April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953\u00a0cholera vaccines and 900,000\u00a0bed nets to Mozambique. The agency's vaccination campaign began in earnest on 3\u00a0April.[125] Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55\u00a0health centers destroyed in the region.[124] Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable.[128]",

      "February flood of 1825": "The February flood of 1825, also known in Germany as the Great Hallig Flood (Gro\u00dfe Halligflut), was a devastating flood that occurred from 3 to 5 February 1825 on the North Sea coast in which about 800 people were drowned. Particularly affected was the North Sea coast of Jutland, Slesvig and Germany. The sand spit Agger Tange was broken through, and the Limfjord got its western opening to the sea. Henceforth, North Jutland has been an island. In North Frisia, the unprotected islets, known as Halligen, were hit. Many dykes had already been damaged in November the year before by a severe storm surge. The island of Pellworm was completely flooded. In East Frisia, the town of Emden was particularly hard hit. However, because the levees in the East Frisian area had been raised significantly in many places in the preceding years, the number of casualties, about 200, was smaller than it might have otherwise been. In the Netherlands, the February flood was the worst natural disaster of the 19th century. Most of the dead and the worst damage occurred in Groningen, Friesland and Overijssel. The reaction at national level was quite similar to that during the Flood of 1953,[1] but the former event was surprisingly quickly forgotten once the damage had been repaired and had no political or engineering consequences. The disaster of 1953 finally allowed a law on Delta Works to be passed for a significant improvement of coastal protection. The flood has been recorded in the Diary of Jan Kruys, by the first Mayor of the town of Vriezenveen, Overijssel (1767-1830): \"The 4th and 5th of this month have been disastrous for numerous residents of this province, as well as many others abroad. People and cattle have drowned, especially in the towns around the South Sea, like Elburg, Kampen, Mastenbroek etc. The government has taken measures to support the victims.\" The Groningen epidemic of 1826, probably caused by a rare outbreak of malaria tropica, was partly the result of the extensive floods and has also been described by Jan Kruys in his diary.[2]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Cyclone Gombe": " Tropical Cyclone Gombe was a strong tropical cyclone that affected Mozambique. It became the first storm to make a major landfall in Nampula Province in Mozambique since Cyclone Jokwe in 2008. The eighth tropical storm, fourth tropical cyclone and fourth intense tropical cyclone of the 2021\u201322 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gombe originated from a tropical disturbance located off the coast of Madagascar. This area of convection was designated by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as Invest 97S on 6 March. The next day, it began to slowly move westward and executed a loop as it became more organized, which prompted M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France Reunion (MFR) to note the system as Zone of Disturbed Weather 09. The system became a depression on 9 March, and became a moderate tropical storm the same day. Soon after being named, Gombe made landfall in Madagascar, and entered in the Mozambique Channel the next day. The storm continued its westward motion while slowly intensifying, and was upgraded to a Tropical Cyclone by the MFR on 10 March. Closing in on Nampula Province, the storm underwent rapid intensification, and was upgraded to the fourth Intense Tropical Cyclone of the year and reached its peak intensity on 11 march, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960 hectopascals (28\u00a0inHg). The storm proceeded to make landfall, and quickly lost its convection over land. On 12 March, Gombe degenerated into a remnant low overland. However, the system subsequently turned southeastward and reemerged over water, before briefly regenerating into a tropical depression on 17 March. Gombe dissipated later that day. Cyclone Gombe killed 72 people across three countries: 63 in Mozambique, 7 in Malawi, and 2 in Madagascar. Tens of thousands of homes were heavily damaged by the storm in Mozambique, and left hundreds of thousands of families without power across Nampula. Gombe affected thousands of hectares of crops, dropped 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) of rain in 24 hours. The Island of Mozambique also experienced some damage from the storm.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Cyclone Gombe originated from a zone of disturbed weather that the M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France on R\u00e9union (MFR) noted on 6 March, located about 280\u00a0nmi (320\u00a0mi; 520\u00a0km) from Mauritius, moving northeast slowly.[1] The system organized its circulation and became active convectively, which prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to designate the system as Invest 97S hours later, and at 11:40 UTC, issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), noting warm sea surface temperatures of 28\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F) along with low wind shear.[2] As it executed a counterclockwise loop, the MFR upgraded the storm to a tropical depression at noon on 7 March, and upgraded it to a moderate tropical storm; the Mauritius Meteorological Services named it Gombe. [nb 1]The JTWC followed suit, and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S at 18:00 UTC that day.[4][5] On 8 March, Gombe made landfall in the Sava Region of Madagascar, and the MFR downgraded the system to an overland depression at 06:00 UTC while it crossed the country,[6] and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical depression as well.[7] 24 hours later, the system reached the Mozambique Channel, moving westward at 7 knots (13\u00a0km/h; 8.1\u00a0mph), and the MFR upgraded it back to a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on 9 March, with 10-minute sustained winds of 45 knots (83\u00a0km/h; 52\u00a0mph).[8] Gombe, driven by a subtropical ridge south of the Channel, continued to move westward, and the MFR observed an improved cloud pattern, upgrading it to a Tropical Cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 10 March, estimating maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph).[9] Gombe then began a period rapid intensification, and the MFR upgraded the storm to Intense Tropical Cyclone, with peak 10-minute sustained winds of 90 knots (170\u00a0km/h; 100\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960 hPa (28.34 inHg) midnight on 11 March.[10] At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 100 knots (190\u00a0km/h; 120\u00a0mph), which made it a Category 3 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale - the storm strengthened approximately 35 knots (65\u00a0km/h; 40\u00a0mph) within 18 hours.[11] The storm made landfall in Nampula Province of Mozambique, the first major cyclone to do so since Cyclone Jokwe of 2008, and subsequently weakened significantly.[12] The MFR downgraded the storm to an Overland Depression for the second time on 06:00 UTC the same day, with the JTWC tagging the system as a high-end Category 1-equivalent.[13][14] The storm continued to move inland into Mozambique, and the MFR issued their last advisory on Gombe a day later, and the JTWC issued their final advisory at 18:00 UTC on 12 March.[15][16]\nIn the advisory released on 17 March by the MFR, what was left of Gombe reorganized itself into a tropical depression as its entered Mozambique channel. However, later that same day, the MFR issued their final advisory on Gombe.[17]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Mozambique[edit]": "39 centers for 23,994[24] displaced people were opened by the National Institute for Disaster Risk Reduction and Management, and about 360 tons of essential items were distributed right after the storm passed.[29] These centers were built with Adobe, which cannot withstand heavy rains.[37] Health care workers reported increased cases of malaria and waterborne diseases amongst those affected.[32] The storm also greatly affected those impacted by the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the northern section of the country, and immediate resources could only support an estimated 100,000 people.[24]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "In Malawi, heavy rain and infrastructure damage was reported. At least 7 people[34] have died in the country; with one in the Mangochi District being a 28-year-old man who was washed away by a flooding river.[35] The cyclone reportedly caused \"heavy damage\" in 10 districts, mostly in the southern portions of the country. A police station, an immigration office, and other buildings were submerged in floodwaters in Mulanje District, with cut-off roads in other areas hampering communication and rescue efforts.[34] In Madagascar, at least two people died and one person reported missing.[36]",

      "Hurricane Alice (December 1954)": " Hurricane Alice is the only known Atlantic hurricane to span two calendar years and one of only two named Atlantic tropical cyclones, along with Tropical Storm Zeta of 2005, to do so. The twelfth tropical cyclone and the eighth hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season, Alice developed on December 30, 1954, from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. After passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, Alice reached peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500\u00a0in 1955\u00a0USD (greater than $6,500,000\u00a0in 2022\u00a0USD). There was an earlier hurricane named Alice in the season. Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2. It received the name Alice in early 1955, though re-analysis of the data supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A cold front moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong anticyclone developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward from the cold front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 30 while located 770 miles (1,240\u00a0km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles, though operationally, the system was believed to have become a tropical depression on December 31.[1] With a narrow ridge of high pressure to its north, the depression moved west-southwestward. Atmospheric conditions were unusually favorable for the time of the year due to the ridge of high pressure preventing cold air from reaching the central Atlantic Ocean. This allowed the depression to intensify into a tropical storm later on December 30, based on direct observations. There were few direct observations for the following days, but it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on December 31 while located about 475 miles (764\u00a0km) east-northeast of Barbuda. On January 1, 1955, a ship within 10 miles (16\u00a0km) of the center reported hurricane-force winds and a pressure of 987\u00a0mbar (29.15\u00a0inHg). Based on this report and several other ship reports, the system was recognized as a tropical low by the San Juan Weather Bureau Office. The hurricane continued to the southwest, and entered the Caribbean Sea on January 2 after passing between Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy. A portion of the eyewall moved over Saint Martin and Saba. Based on near-hurricane-force winds from the affected islands, an information bulletin named the system as Hurricane Alice while in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Throughout its track, Alice was a small tropical cyclone with a diameter of only around 60 miles (97\u00a0km).[1] Reconnaissance aircraft flew into Hurricane Alice on January 3 and confirmed the existence of the tropical cyclone by reporting winds between 60 and 65\u00a0mph (97 and 105\u00a0km/h) and a warm core center. It is estimated Alice continued to intensify as it tracked southwestward in the Caribbean Sea, and attained peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) while located about 95 miles (153\u00a0km) west-northwest of Montserrat. While near its peak the hurricane developed a ring of convection around its eye, and Alice maintained peak winds for about 24\u00a0hours until cold air from the north weakened it. Extratropical cyclogenesis occurred north of Bermuda on January 3, which weakened the high pressure system to the north of Alice and turned the flow in the Caribbean Sea to that of cold northwesterly winds. Alice turned to the southeast on January 4 and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Convection gradually became disorganized, and after weakening to a tropical depression on January 5, Alice dissipated on January 6 while located about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) west-northwest of Grenada.[1]",
      "Impact, naming and records[edit]": "Subsequent to the confirmation of the existence of Hurricane Alice, the U.S. Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico warned the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles to prepare for strong winds and rough seas.[1] Hurricane Alice produced moderate to strong winds across the islands, peaking at 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) in Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) in Saba.[2] The hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across several islands, including a peak of 11.27 inches (286\u00a0mm) in 48\u00a0hours recorded at Saba. Due to its small size, only a few islands received significant effects from the hurricane. Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Saba, Anguilla, Sint Eustatius, and Saint Kitts reported damage from the hurricane, totaling $623,500 (1955\u00a0USD, $4.7\u00a0million 2006\u00a0USD). Damage was heaviest on Saba and Anguilla, occurring primarily to shipping facilities and crops.[1] 626\u00a0houses were destroyed or severely damaged on Anguilla, as well.[3] The damage was caused mostly by heavy rainfall and rough seas, not the direct action of the wind. The passage of Hurricane Alice greatly troubled the economies of the small affected islands.[1] Additionally, the outer rainbands of the storm alleviated dry conditions on Puerto Rico which had persisted since the previous October. No deaths were reported.[2] This storm formed on December 30; however, in the days before satellites, meteorologists had to rely on reports from ships and islands in the Atlantic to locate and track storms. This information was often sketchy; two cyclones, including a Category 2 hurricane, operationally went undetected in 1954. It was officially recognized as a significant tropical cyclone on January 2, 1955. At the time, the National Weather Service used the same naming list each year, so the name given to this storm was \"Alice\" and it was designated as a part of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season. However, it was found during post-storm analysis that the storm had actually formed on December 30, and was instead a part of the 1954 season. Therefore, the season had two storms named \"Alice\" \u2014 the first storm of the season, and the last. Had Alice been discovered before the end of the calendar year, it would have been named Irene, the next name on the 1954 list. Some reports named this storm Alice2 to avoid confusion with the earlier Alice from June 1954.[1][4][5] Alice formed later in the calendar year than any Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, forming six hours later in the season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Alice was one of only eight Atlantic tropical cyclones to form in the month of December. Alice was the first of two Atlantic tropical cyclones to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist in the month of January, with the most recent being an unnamed subtropical cyclone in 2023.[6]",

      "1899 San Ciriaco hurricane": "The 1899 San Cir\u00edaco hurricane, also known as the 1899 Puerto Rico Hurricane or The Great Bahamas Hurricane of 1899, was the longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record, and the third-longest-lived tropical cyclone globally on record (in terms of tropical duration) after 1994's Hurricane John in the Pacific Ocean and 2023's Cyclone Freddy in the southern Indian Ocean. It was also one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history, with an estimated  3,800 fatalities. The third tropical cyclone and first major hurricane of the season, this storm was first observed southwest of Cape Verde on August\u00a03. It slowly strengthened while heading steadily west-northwestward across the Atlantic Ocean and reached hurricane status by late on August\u00a05. During the following 48\u00a0hours, it deepened further, reaching Category\u00a04 on the modern day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) before crossing the Leeward Islands on August\u00a07. Later that day, the storm peaked with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). The storm weakened slightly before making landfall in Guayama, Puerto Rico with winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a08. Several hours later, it emerged into the southwestern Atlantic as a Category\u00a03 hurricane. The system paralleled the north coast of Dominican Republic and then crossed the Bahamas, striking several islands. Then, on August 14, it started to move north while still being located east of Florida. The storm recurved northeastward early the next morning and appeared to be moving out to sea. However, by August\u00a017, it turned back to the northwest and made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina early on the following day. No stronger hurricane has made landfall on the Outer Banks since the San Ciriaco hurricane. The storm weakened after moving inland and fell to Category\u00a01 intensity by 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018. Later that day, the storm re-emerged into the Atlantic. Now heading northeastward, it continued weakening, but maintained Category\u00a01 intensity. By late on August\u00a020, the storm curved eastward over the northwestern Atlantic. It also began losing tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022, while located about 325 miles (525\u00a0km) south of Sable Island. However, after four days, the system regenerated into a tropical storm while located about 695 miles (1,120\u00a0km) west-southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on August\u00a026. It moved slowly north-northwestward, until curving to the east on August\u00a029. Between August\u00a026 and September\u00a01, the storm did not differentiate in intensity, but began re-strengthening while turning southeastward on September\u00a02. Early on the following day, the storm again reached hurricane intensity. It curved northeastward and passed through the Azores on September\u00a03, shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. In Guadeloupe, the storm unroofed and flooded many houses. Communications were significantly disrupted in the interior portions of the island. Impact was severe in Montserrat, with nearly every building destroyed and 100\u00a0deaths reported. About 200\u00a0small houses were destroyed on Saint Kitts, with estates suffering considerable damage, while nearly all estates were destroyed on Saint Croix. Eleven deaths were reported on the island. In Puerto Rico, the system brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, which caused extensive flooding. Approximately 250,000\u00a0people were left without food and shelter. Additionally, telephone, telegraph, and electrical services were completely lost. Overall, damage totaled approximately $20\u00a0million, with over half were losses inflicted on crops, particularly coffee. At the time, it was the costliest and worst tropical cyclone in the history of Puerto Rico. It was estimated that the storm caused 3,369\u00a0fatalities on the island territory. In the Bahamas, strong winds and waves sank 50\u00a0small crafts, most of them at Andros. Severe damage was reported in Nassau, with over 100\u00a0buildings destroyed and many damaged, including the Government House. A few houses were also destroyed on Bimini. The death toll in the Bahamas was at least 125. In North Carolina, storm surge and rough sea destroyed fishing piers and bridges, as well as sank about 10\u00a0vessels. Hatteras Island was almost entirely inundated with 4 to 10 feet (1.2 to 3.0\u00a0m) of water, and many homes were damaged.  There was also much destruction at Diamond City, on the Shackleford Banks near Cape Lookout. There were at least 20\u00a0deaths in the state of North Carolina. In the Azores, the storm also caused one fatality and significant damage on some islands.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical storm of unknown origins developed about 480 miles (770\u00a0km) southwest of the southwesternmost islands of Cape Verde at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03.[1] According to an article by the United States Hydrographic Office, the British steamship Grangense encountered the system later that day, while located about 1,800 miles (2,900\u00a0km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. According to the ship's log, there was a \"sudden change in the weather\", falling barometric pressures, and increasingly rough seas. Further, the storm \"showed all the symptoms of a genuine West Indian hurricane underdeveloped.\" The captain, who followed a route from Europe to Brazil for many years, noted that he never experienced \"any weather of cyclonic character so far to the eastward before\".[2] Thereafter, the storm strengthened and reached winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a04. Intensification halted until late on the following day, at which time the storm reached hurricane status. Around 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a06, it became a Category\u00a02 hurricane. Early the next day, the system deepened to a Category\u00a03. While approaching the Lesser Antilles, it continued to strengthen, reaching Category\u00a04 status around midday on August\u00a07. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane passed through the Lesser Antilles and made landfall on Guadeloupe. At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a07, the system attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930\u00a0mbar (27\u00a0inHg),[1] observed by a weather station on Montserrat.[3] The hurricane weakened slightly while moving west-northward across the Caribbean Sea and made landfall in Guayama, Puerto Rico late on August\u00a08 with winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h).[1] August 8 was the namesday of Saint Cyriacus, hence the hurricane's nickname.[4] Several weather stations across the island reported low barometric pressures, with a reading as low as 939\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg) in Guayama. Wind shifts were also experienced across the island, primarily in the south and the west. The storm crossed Puerto Rico in approximately six hours and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean late on August\u00a08, while weakening to a Category\u00a03 hurricane, with winds decreasing to 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h). The hurricane would maintain this intensity for more than nine days. Continuing west-northward, the hurricane brushed the north coast of Dominican Republic on August\u00a09. Thereafter, the system moved slowly northwestward through the Bahamas, striking Inagua on August\u00a010 and Andros Island on August\u00a012.[1] According to telephone and telegraph reports from the Weather Bureau, the storm was predicted to make landfall in Florida.[2] However, the storm instead curved north-northwestward and struck Grand Bahama on August\u00a013.[1] The next day, officials at the Weather Bureau predicted that the hurricane would strike Charleston, South Carolina, at which time it would have weakened \"into an ordinary blow\".[2] The storm instead eventually turned northeastward and moved parallel to the coast of the Southeastern United States for a few days. By early on August\u00a017, however, the hurricane re-curved northwestward. At 01:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a018, it made landfall near Hatteras, North Carolina, with winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h). Five hours later, the storm weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane. Around midday on August\u00a018, it fell to Category\u00a01 hurricane intensity while re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean. Thereafter, the storm drifted slowly east-northeastward before accelerating to the northeast after 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019. It moved parallel to Long Island and New England, until curving just north of due east late on the following day.[1] The system began losing tropical characteristics after interacting with a weather front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on August\u00a022,[5][1] while situated about 325\u00a0miles (525\u00a0km) south of Sable Island, Nova Scotia. The extratropical system moved east-southeastward and then southeastward, while continuing to weaken. By August\u00a024, it curved eastward and then northeastward the next day.[1] Operationally, it was believed that the system remained extratropical. However, Partagas indicated that it regenerated into a tropical storm at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026,[5][1] while located about 695\u00a0miles (1,120\u00a0km) southwest of Flores Island, Azores. Initially, the rejuvenated system drifted slowly north-northwestward, before turning northward on August\u00a027. No change in intensity occurred for nearly a week. On August\u00a028, it curved northeastward and then eastward, while continuing to drift.[1] By September\u00a01, the storm began to accelerate and moved east-southeastward. It resumed intensification the next day after curving southeast, and was upgraded to a hurricane early on September\u00a03,[1] based on barometric pressure data.[5] A few hours later, the hurricane attained a secondary peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Late on September\u00a03, the storm passed through the Azores, shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. After becoming extratropical, the remnants moved rapidly northeastward and continued to weaken, before dissipating southwest of Ireland late on September\u00a04.[1] However, the Weather Bureau noted that gales prevailed offshore France until September\u00a012, when the system merged with a low pressure area.[6] With just under 28\u00a0days as a tropical cyclone, this system became the longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane on record.[7]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "On August\u00a07, after stations in the Lesser Antilles reported a change in wind from the northeast to the northwest, the United States Weather Bureau ordered hurricane signals at Roseau, Dominica, Basseterre, Saint Kitts, and San Juan, Puerto Rico; later, a hurricane signal was raised at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Advisory messages were sent to other locations throughout the Caribbean, including Santo Domingo, Kingston, Jamaica, and Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Information was also telegraphed to major seaports along the Gulf and East coasts of the United States. On August\u00a09, hurricane signals were posted at Santiago de Cuba, while all vessels bound northward and eastward from Cuba were advised to remain in port.[6]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Lesser Antilles[edit]": "While passing through the Leeward Islands, strong winds were reported on several islands.[2] In Guadeloupe, the storm unroofed and flooded many houses and buildings, including the American Consulate in Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre.[8] Communications were significantly disrupted in the interior portions of the island. Two schooners sunk and at least 23\u00a0flat boats were pushed ashore in the \u00celes des Saintes archipelago of Guadeloupe.[9] Impact was severe in Montserrat, with nearly every building destroyed. The Courthouse and a school, both of which remained standing, became crowded with homeless women and children. One-hundred deaths and fourteen-hundred injuries were reported.[2] In Saint Kitts, 5-minute sustained winds were 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h), while 1-minute sustained winds were as high as 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h). About 200\u00a0small houses were destroyed on Saint Kitts, with estates suffering considerable damage. Despite the impact, no deaths occurred, which was attributed to ample warnings. On Nevis, the hurricane left \"general destruction\" and at least 21\u00a0fatalities. Nearly all estates were demolished on Saint Croix, while almost every large building was deroofed. Eleven deaths were reported on the island.[2]",
      "Puerto Rico[edit]": "Taking place a mere 12 months after the American invasion of the Island, U.S. Army Major Albert L. Myer described it as \"more disruptive to Puerto Rican society than was the American invasion.\"[10]\nThe San Ciriaco hurricane was described as the first major storm in Puerto Rico since the 1876 San Felipe hurricane. Approximately 250,000\u00a0people were left without food and shelter. Overall, damage totaled approximately $35.8\u00a0million, with over half were losses inflicted on crops, particularly coffee. At the time, it was the costliest and worst tropical cyclone in Puerto Rico. The number of fatalities ranged from 3,100 to 3,400, with the official estimate being 3,369. The San Ciriaco hurricane is the deadliest tropical cyclone in the history of Puerto Rico.[11][12] Strong winds were reported throughout the island, reaching 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) at many locations and over 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) in Humacao, Mayag\u00fcez, and Ponce. Within the municipality of Ponce, 500\u00a0people died, mostly from drowning. Streets were flooded, waterfront businesses were destroyed, and several government buildings were damaged. Telephone, telegraph, and electrical services were completely lost. Ponce was described as an image of \"horrible desolation\" by its municipal council. Impact was worst in Utuado, with damage exceeding $2.5\u00a0million. In Humacao, 23 inches (580\u00a0mm) of rain fell in only 24\u00a0hours.[11]",
      "Greater Antilles and Bahamas[edit]": "In Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall caused the Ozama River to overflow its banks, sweeping away an iron bridge. A freshet was also reported along the Haina River in San Crist\u00f3bal Province, washing away many houses.[6] The storm brought catastrophic impact to the Bahamas and at least 334\u00a0deaths. Losses to boating vessels reached $50,000. On Inagua, three vessels were lost and a schooner was left stranded at Lantern Head, while other boats that were hauled up on the bay suffered severe damage. The public school house was demolished on Ragged Island, though dwellings escaped serious impact. Plantain and banana plantations were completely flattened at Deadman's Cay on Long Island. Three vessels were beached on Rum Cay, but only one was considerably damaged. About 10\u00a0bushels of salt were lost. Two churches and a number of private homes were damaged on San Salvador Island. A few ships and vessels were destroyed, damaged, or lost on Eleuthera, leaving a few people missing.[13] On San Salvador Island, two churches and many dwellings were destroyed. Exuma was devastated by the storm. All boats and other forms of transportation on the island were destroyed, with several crews either completely lost or missing some few members. Several bodies washed ashore and were immediately buried. A total of 46\u00a0deaths were reported at sea, with some victims as young as 8-years old. At Gray's Settlement, several houses, outbuildings, and a church were destroyed. Of the buildings that remained standing, many lost their roof. At Barritarri and Rolleville, churches were deroofed and several small buildings suffered complete destruction. Throughout the island, 97\u00a0dwellings were destroyed and 131\u00a0others were damaged, which did not include the number of kitchens, barns, and homes demolished at Alexandria and Stuart's Manor. Overall, the storm left at least 64\u00a0fatalities on Exuma alone.[13] Within the capital city of Nassau, fences and boundary walls separating businesses and properties were felled.[13] A fruit factory, a sponge warehouse, a dancing pavilion, and about 100\u00a0smaller buildings were destroyed.[6] A few public buildings were damaged, including the prison and the Government House. Damage to homes in Nassau was light in comparison to the dwellings in the suburbs, where lower-class homes suffered extensive impact or were completely destroyed. A total of 44\u00a0multi-family residences were demolished. Many adobes in Adelaide were flattened, forcing 12\u00a0families to live in a church. Three people suffered serious injuries after a home near Gambier was destroyed. The entire community of Gambier was reportedly wiped out. Local agriculture also experienced significant impact, with two orchards alone losing many trees and thousands of fruits. All sisal plantations on the island were demolished.[13] Of the 50\u00a0small crafts capsized by strong winds and waves in the Bahamas, a majority of these were located at Andros Island.[6] Several settlements along the northern portions of the island were devastated, with numerous homes flattened and all crops were destroyed, including coconuts, corn, grapefruit, oranges, peas, and potatoes. At Red Bays, two churches were destroyed and many houses were washed away. Several sponging vessels were beached, resulting in an \"astronomical\" number of casualties. Only seven homes remained standing at Nicholls Town. A church was demolished along the Staniard Creek. At Coakley Town, several houses were blown down, while a number of vessels sunk. Overall, at least 114\u00a0deaths occurred on land alone. Several schooners were lost near Andros Island, while at least 30\u00a0other schooners were driven ashore and severely damaged or demolished.[13]",
      "United States and elsewhere[edit]": "Offshore the United States between Florida and North Carolina, the Norwegian bark Drot encountered the hurricane. A large wave swept the captain and seven crew members overboard. The remaining men built a makeshift raft out of the ship's plank in order to survive. However, the raft split into two, with two men on one portion and six on the other. On the former raft, a person committed suicide by jumping into the raging sea, but the remaining man was eventually rescued by the German steamship Titania. Of the six men on the other raft, three of them intentionally jumped into the ocean and drowned. Because the remaining three men realized that they were facing starvation or death by dehydration, they drew locks to determine who would be cannibalized by the other two. The man who lost was killed and the two surviving people drank blood from his veins. One of the persons remaining then went insane and bit large chunks of flesh from the other man's face and chest. On August 31, two weeks after the ship sunk, the two survivors were finally rescued by the British steamer Woodruff.[13] The Weather Bureau office in Jupiter, Florida, recorded sustained winds of 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) and a gusts up to 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h). Winds downed all telegraph lines in the area, which disrupted telegraphic communications for about 48\u00a0hours. Brief periods of heavy rainfall were also reported.[6] At The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach, storm surge ripped off the upper portion of the ocean deck, which consisted of railings, a canopy, and a flagpole.[14] Between Titusville and Miami, losses reached $5,000. Tides along the coast of South Carolina peaked at 2.8\u00a0ft (0.85\u00a0m), resulting in no coastal flooding. Well executed warnings were attributed to no fatalities in South Carolina.[6] Strong winds were observed in coastal North Carolina, with sustained winds up to 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and gusts as high as 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h). However, the anemometer then blew away. According to the Weather Bureau, \"the entire island\" of Hatteras was submerged in 4 to 10\u00a0ft (1.2 to 3.0\u00a0m) of water due to storm surge.[15] A personal account by Weather Bureau observer S. L. Dosher noted that it was typical for 40\u00a0to 50\u00a0individuals in Hatteras to seek shelter in a home because of coastal flooding, only to be forced to venture to another dwelling due to rising water.[16] In only four houses, less than 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) of water was recorded. All fishing piers and equipment were destroyed, while every bridge was swept away. About 10\u00a0vessels, including a large steamship, were wrecked.[15] Dosher, sent a report to Washington, D.C., on August 21, four days after the storm hit the Outer Banks. In his report Dosher wrote:\n\"The howling wind, the rushing and roaring tide and the awful sea which swept over the beach and thundered like a thousand pieces of artillery made a picture which was at once appalling and terrible and the like of which Dante's Inferno could scarcely equal.\" He stated, \"At about 8 p.m. on the 17th when the wind lulled and shifted to the east and the tide began to run off with great swiftness, causing a fall of several feet in less than a half hour, a prayer of thankfulness went up from every soul on the island, and strong men, who had held up a brave heart against the terrible strain of the past 12 hours, broke down and wept like children...\"[17] Severe damage also occurred at Diamond City and Shackleford Banks, where nearly every house was swept away. A number of farm animals drowned. The tides unearthed caskets, damaging them and leaving bones scattered throughout the towns. After the storm, residents began abandoning the area and re-settled in other cities, most of them located elsewhere in the Outer Banks. On Ocracoke Island, the island was covered with 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 metres) of water. A total of 33\u00a0homes were destroyed and nearly every other suffered damage. Additionally, two churches were demolished. Several cows, horses, and sheep drowned.[16] Among the ships that wrecked was the barkentine Priscilla. Rasmus Midgett, a United States Life-Saving Service member, single-handedly rescued 10\u00a0people from the Priscilla. On October\u00a018, Midgett was awarded the Lifesaving Medal by Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage.[18] Heavy rains and strong winds as far inland as Raleigh resulted in \"great damage\" to crops. There were at least 20\u00a0fatalities in North Carolina.[15] Strong winds were also reported in Virginia. At Cape Henry, winds peaked at 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) for five minutes. In Norfolk, five-minute sustained winds reached 42 miles per hour (68\u00a0km/h). The storm was quite severe along the James River, with low-lying areas of Norfolk inundated by wind-driven tides, while livestock drowned in the flood waters at Suffolk. A \"heavy northeastern storm\" began in Petersburg the night of August\u00a017. In Southside Virginia Corn and tobacco suffered considerable damage as crops were leveled by strong winds.[19] In the Azores, \"several lives were lost\" on S\u00e3o Miguel Island. Strong winds and heavy rainfall damaged many houses, inundated several roads, and toppled a number of telegraph poles.",
      "Aftermath and records[edit]": "Some wealthy citizens and local governments in Puerto Rico provided food and shelter in the immediate aftermath of the storm, but their resources were too limited to effectively handle the disaster. Following Military Governor George Whitefield Davis's initial assessment of damage, he requested that the federal government appeal to citizens for aid. In San Juan, Major John Van Hoff established a Board of Charities, which was staffed by military doctors and clergy. Davis requested that similar committees be developed and headed by three \"people of respectability\" in each town. At the time, the island was divided into 12\u00a0military districts. Davis ordered that commanding officers assess damage in each district and report the number of citizens without food and shelter. Hundreds submitted petitions for tax relief, including 369 in Lares alone. The destruction of infrastructure made it difficult to deliver aid, especially because of an 11\u00a0mi (18\u00a0km) section of railroad destroyed between A\u00f1asco and Mayag\u00fcez. Many roads and bridges were rebuilt in the following months. However, because the railroads were privately owned, the government hesitated to begin repairs. Various municipal governments proposed 25 million to 30 million pesos in bonds to fund restoration efforts.[11] On August\u00a024, the USAT McClellan departed the United States Quartermaster's dock in Brooklyn after being filled with supplies by the Puerto Rican Relief Committee of the Merchant's Association including 12,600\u00a0vests for women, 4,800\u00a0women's wrappers, 4,200\u00a0undershirts for men, 600\u00a0pairs of trousers, and 215\u00a0children's garments. H. C. F. Koch & Co. also sent 265\u00a0articles of women and children's clothing. Additionally, the Windsor Company donated one case of calico, the Renfrew Machinery Company contributed one case of gingham, the Hines Underwear Company gave away knit underwear, and the National Biscuit Company (now known as Nabisco) sent 30\u00a0barrels of bread.[20] In the Bahamas, the House of Assembly held a special session to vote for a measure that authorized expenditure for relief throughout the country. Additionally, Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain called on several vessels to distribute and render assistance to the Out Islands. The British Government enacted the Hurricane Warning Act, which ordered that hurricane signal flags be hoisted at Fort Charlotte and Fort Fincastle in the event of a hurricane. The new regulation also required these flags to be raised when the barometric pressure fell to a certain point. Additionally, the Imperial Lighthouse Service issued a set of signal flags to all lighthouses in the Bahamas.[13] There was so much Destruction in Diamond City, North Carolina that the approximately 500 residents of the settlement and island decided to move inland.  The last of the residents had left by 1902, and even relocated houses to nearby places such as Harkers Island, Salter Path and Morehead City.[21] Hurricane San Ciriaco set many records on its path. Resulting in at least 3,369\u00a0deaths in Puerto Rico, the storm was the deadliest hurricane to hit the island and the strongest at the time, until the Hurricane San Felipe Segundo made landfall in 1928 as a Category\u00a05 hurricane. It was also among the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded. Also, with an Accumulated cyclone energy of 73.57, it has the highest ACE of any Atlantic hurricane in history and was second highest overall, until surpassed by 2023's Cyclone Freddy. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan became the second Atlantic hurricane to surpass an ACE value of 70, but did not surpass the San Ciriaco hurricane. The San Ciriaco hurricane is also the longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, lasting for 27.75\u00a0days.[7]",
      "Migration to Hawaii[edit]": "The hurricane was one of the reasons why some 5,000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Hawaii. Two historians, living in Hawaii, documented the history of Puerto Rican migration to Hawaii and stated the San Ciriaco hurricane was one of the main reasons why Puerto Ricans went to Hawaii.[22][23]\n\"Nicolas G. Vegas wrote in his Narraci\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica (Patriotic Narration):[24] De aquel pa\u00eds borincano\nTierras de tan lindas flores\nDe all\u00ed salimos, se\u00f1ores.\nA este suelo hawaiiano. . . .\n\nNadie pensaba olvidar\nAquel amable rinc\u00f3n\nY por causa del cicl\u00f3n\nNos tuvimos que embarcar\nY empezamos a navegar\nPara distantes regiones\nAfligidos corazones\nDejamos a nuestra espalda\nY de aquella tierra sana\nDe all\u00ed salimos, se\u00f1ores. From that Borinquen land\nLands with such beautiful flowers\nFrom there we left, sirs,\nFor this Hawaiian land. . . .\n\nNobody thought he would forget\nThat friendly part of the world\nAnd because of the cyclone\nWe had to set sail\nAnd we began to navigate\nFor distant regions\nAfflicted hearts\nWe left behind us\nAnd from that healthy land\nFrom there we left, sirs.\"",
      "Name[edit]": "The hurricane earned its name by striking Puerto Rico on August 8, the Roman Catholic feast day devoted to Saint Cyriacus (San Ciriaco in Spanish). This was a common practice prior to the introduction of standardized hurricane names \u2013 for example, the 1867 San Narciso hurricane, the 1928 San Felipe hurricane, and the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane were also named after the feast day on which they occurred.[25]",

      "Hurricane Cleo": "Hurricane Cleo was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the third named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season. Cleo was one of the longest-lived storms of the season. This compact yet powerful hurricane travelled through the Caribbean Sea and later hit Florida before moving offshore Georgia into the Carolinas, killing 156\u00a0people and causing roughly $187\u00a0million in damages. Major damage was seen as far north as east-central Florida, with the heaviest rains falling along the immediate coast of the Southeast United States into southeast Virginia.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on August 15, 1964, moved westward, not organizing into a tropical depression until around 890 miles (1,430\u00a0km) east of Barbados on August 20\u2013as reported by a Navy reconnaissance plane. It continued west-northwestward, quickly strengthening to a hurricane the next day with a minimum central pressure of 993\u00a0mb.[1] Early in the afternoon of August 22, Cleo crossed Guadeloupe as a 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a03 hurricane. The hurricane continued to strengthen as it moved through the Caribbean Sea and reached its peak intensity of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) on August 23 while south of the Dominican Republic. It maintained that intensity for a day, bringing heavy rain and winds to Hispaniola. As Cleo passed south of Haiti on August 24, it veered northward momentarily, enough to move on to the Southwest Peninsula of Haiti. The circulation of the hurricane was greatly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of the island, quickly weakening the hurricane.[2] Cleo weakened to a Category\u00a01 hurricane before hitting southern Cuba on August 26. It crossed the island quickly. Shortly after emerging from the north coast of Cuba, Cleo restrengthened to a hurricane, having weakened to a tropical storm while over Cuba. Cleo managed to intensify to a 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), Category\u00a02 hurricane before hitting the Miami, Florida area on August 27.[3]  It weakened to a tropical storm while over Florida on the 28th. The center moved offshore between Jacksonville and St. Augustine, Florida, before moving back onshore near Savannah, Georgia on August 29 without any increase in intensity. Its northward path along the Florida coast was unusual for the month of August.[4] Cleo continued to weaken as it moved through the Carolinas, drifting through as a tropical depression. After bringing heavy rain through the area, Cleo exited into the Atlantic Ocean near Norfolk, Virginia,[5] and quickly intensified to a tropical storm again on September 1. The following day, Cleo became a hurricane again, but it remained well offshore and did not cause any further damage. Cleo was last noted on September 5 northeast of Newfoundland.",
      "Preparation[edit]": "Early on August 21 hurricane warnings were in effect for Barbados and the Windward Islands.[6]  On August 22 hurricane warnings were in effect for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, with hurricane watches in effect for Haiti and the Dominican Republic.[7]  By August 23, hurricane watches remained in effect for Haiti and the Dominican Republic.[8] Hurricane warnings were issued for Jamaica on August 24.[9]  By August 26 a hurricane watch had been raised from Key Largo, Florida to West Palm Beach, Florida.[10]  In advance of Cleo, the second stage of the Titan II/Gemini launch vehicle was taken down and stored in a hangar on August 26 to protect it from the storm.[11]  Early on August 27, hurricane warnings extended northward to Cape Kennedy, Florida with gale warnings northward to Daytona Beach, Florida.[12]  Hurricane warnings were in effect northward to Brunswick, Georgia early on August 28 with a hurricane watch in effect between Brunswick, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina.[13]  The hurricane watch for portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts continued into August 29.[14]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Guadeloupe[edit]": "Official reports from Guadeloupe indicated 14 dead, 40 injured, 1,000 homes destroyed and extensive damage to the island's infrastructure. The hurricane devastated sugar and banana plantations.[16]  One C-124 aircraft delivered seven tons of relief supplies to the island.[17]",
      "Greater Antilles[edit]": "Moderate to heavy rains fell across Puerto Rico, peaking at 4.95 inches (126\u00a0mm) at Matrullas Dam.[18]  The outer bands of Cleo produced peak sustained winds of 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) at Point Tuna, Puerto Rico.[1] Offshore Puerto Rico on its initial penetration of Cleo on August 23, a Lockheed WC-121N Super Constellation used as a reconnaissance aircraft experienced its port wing tip fuel tank and portion of wing torn away by extreme updraft turbulence, which injured six of its crew. While trying to exit the storm, the starboard tip tank and larger portion of wing were torn away by extreme down draft turbulence. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.[19] Cleo led to the wettest known 24\u2011hour period recorded for any site within the Dominican Republic for any month, with 19.99 inches (508\u00a0mm) falling at Polo.[20]  Les Cayes, Haiti was leveled as the storm struck the town.[16]  The aircraft carrier U.S.S. Boxer arrived off the coast of Hispaniola on August 29 to provide medical aid and evacuation services to those in the worst impacted areas of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Damage in Cuba was minimal because the hurricane had weakened and moved through quickly.",
      "Florida[edit]": "The hurricane was the first to directly strike Miami since Hurricane King in the 1950 season.[1] Cleo intensified rapidly just prior to landfall, bringing sustained winds of 100\u2013105\u00a0mph (161\u2013169\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) to the Miami area, due to moving over water temperatures of 30 to 32\u00a0degrees Celsius and its compact size. Lightning was observed within the eyewall at the National Hurricane Center. The pressure fell to 967.6\u00a0mb (28.57\u00a0inches) in North Miami. Major damage was constrained to a 20\u201335 miles (32\u201356\u00a0km) wide strip from Miami to Melbourne,[3]  in the form of broken glass, interior flooding, uprooted trees, overturned aircraft, power failures, and agriculture. Cleo cut power to 620,000 homes and businesses in southeast Florida.[21]  In Miami Shores the electricity was out for five days. At least two dozen fires blazed across Miami.[16]  About a quarter of the grapefruit crop was lost within the Indian River citrus producing region. The storm surge reached 4\u20136 feet (1.2\u20131.8\u00a0m) between Miami and Pompano Beach. The highest rainfall total measured within Florida was 9.37 inches (238\u00a0mm) at Stuart.[22] The Sebastian River Baptist Church had its roof torn off during the cyclone.[23]\nMinor damage occurred north of Melbourne.[5]  Heavy rains fell along the east coast of the state, along and east of its track.[18]  Three tornadoes were reported with the storm within the state borders.[24] Cleo caused the Fort Lauderdale News, one of South Florida's biggest newspapers, to miss publishing, the only time that happened in its history. Storyland, a popular children's theme park in Pompano Beach, was destroyed and never rebuilt.[21]  A disaster declaration for Florida was made on September 8.[25] Florida Atlantic University's grand opening to students was delayed six days due to Cleo.[26]",
      "Southeast United States[edit]": "Heavy rains spread up along the Georgia coast into the Carolinas and southern Virginia in association with the weakening tropical storm. Interaction with a frontal boundary to its north led to significant rains across extreme southeast Virginia to the left of its track exceeding 14 inches (360\u00a0mm) in the Norfolk metropolitan area.[18]  This helped lead to double the average rainfall for the month of September for southeast Virginia.[27]  Seven tornadoes were reported within South Carolina, while North Carolina witnessed three tornado touchdowns.[24]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "The name Cleo was later retired by the Weather Bureau. It was replaced with Candy for the 1968 season.[28][29]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "After surviving Cleo's wrath in the Bahamas, a survivor came up with the idea of a floating hospital designed to help out areas after a catastrophe. A husband-wife pair who survived Cleo bought a retired luxury liner for such a purpose 14\u00a0years later, and it was put into service in 1982.[30] Virginia Beach, Virginia fought to build a drainage canal to help drain the Lynnhaven flood zone after Cleo's flooding rains struck the region. Over the objection of those in North Carolina, the canal was built. The result of the creation of this canal was an increase in salinity of nearly fivefold from pre-canal levels, which decimated aquatic vegetation in Currituck Sound by 1998. As a result, black bass disappeared from Currituck Sound.[31]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Tropical Storm Norman (2006)": "Tropical Storm Norman was a weak tropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico in October 2006. The fifteenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Norman developed on October 9 from a tropical wave well to the southwest of Mexico. Unfavorable conditions quickly encountered the system, and within two days of forming, Norman dissipated as its remnants turned to the east. Thunderstorms gradually increased again, as it interacted with a disturbance to its east, and on October 15 the cyclone regenerated just off the coast of Mexico. The center became disorganized and quickly dissipated, bringing a large area of moisture which dropped up to 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) of rainfall to southwestern Mexico. Rainfall from the storm flooded about 150\u00a0houses, of which 20 were destroyed. One person was injured, and initially there were reports of two people missing due to the storm; however, it was not later confirmed.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 21, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection on October 5.[1] Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable.[2] On October 7 it developed a broad low pressure area,[3] and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000\u00a0UTC on October 9, about 765\u00a0mi (1,231\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.[1] Upon first becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving north-northwestward, around the western periphery of a weak ridge; the first forecast advisory by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the depression to gradually intensify before weakening and crossing the Baja California Peninsula.[4] Located over warm water temperatures, the system developed an area of organized, deep convection near the center; with satellite intensity estimates of tropical storm force using the Dvorak technique, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman about 12\u00a0hours after it first formed.[5] Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) early on October 10.[1] At the time, it was officially forecast to strengthen further and continue northeastward. However, some hurricane prediction models anticipated quick weakening and a sharp turn to the southeast.[6] Shortly after peaking in intensity, southwesterly wind shear increased, which led to a decrease in convection coverage. At the same time, a trough extending from California southward caused Norman to stall and turn to the east.[7] The convection rapidly became separated from the center; by late on October 10, the center was located about 115 miles (185\u00a0km) from the nearest thunderstorms. By then, it had weakened to tropical depression status,[8] and early on October 11 Norman degenerated into a remnant low about 530 miles (850\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.[1] The remnants of Norman continued to the east, and later to the east-southeast as it interacted with a tropical disturbance off the coast of Mexico.[1] Initially, re-development of Norman was not expected, as the disturbance was instead given the possibility for further development.[9] On October 13, the NHC noted that the remnants of Norman were merging with the disturbance to its east;[10] during the interaction, convection redeveloped and organized around the remnant low of Norman, and early on October 15 it reformed into a tropical depression, near the coast of southwestern Mexico.[1] With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, Norman was predicted to re-attain tropical storm status before moving ashore.[11] However, the center quickly became less-organized,[12] turning northward and northwestward within the larger tropical disturbance. Late on October 15, it is estimated Tropical Depression Norman dissipated 23 miles (37\u00a0km) south and offshore of Manzanillo, Colima, although satellite imagery suggested the center may have dissipated inland.[1]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "When Norman redeveloped into a tropical cyclone, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas to Cabo Corrientes.[1] The storm brought heavy rainfall to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35 inches (161\u00a0mm) in La Villita, Michoac\u00e1n.[13] Flooding from four days of rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150\u00a0homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating the flooded houses.[14] In total, 20\u00a0homes were destroyed, and 20\u00a0villages were left without power.[15] A transport vehicle carrying 15\u00a0people was swept away by a flooded stream, resulting in one injury; the truck was later rescued by police workers.[14] About 300 hectares (740 acres) of crop fields sustained damage;[15] however, little crop damage was reported, as the storm occurred after harvesting had ended.[14] Across Mexico, the storm affected about 500,000\u00a0people, and initially there were two people missing;[15] however, a subsequent report indicated there were no casualties associated with the storm.[1]",

      "Hurricane Michael": "  Hurricane Michael was a powerful and destructive tropical cyclone that became the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States since Andrew in 1992. It was the third-most intense Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States in terms of pressure, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille in 1969. Michael was the first Category\u00a05 hurricane on record to impact the Florida Panhandle, the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the contiguous United States, in terms of wind speed, and the most intense hurricane on record to strike the United States in the month of October. The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Michael originated from a broad low-pressure area that formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 1. The disturbance became a tropical depression on October 7, after nearly a week of slow development. By the next day, Michael had intensified into a hurricane near the western tip of Cuba, as it moved northward. The hurricane rapidly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico, reaching major hurricane status on October 9. As it approached the Florida Panhandle, Michael reached Category\u00a05 status with peak winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h)[1] just before making landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida, on October 10, becoming the first to do so in the region as a Category\u00a05 hurricane, and as the strongest storm of the season. As it moved inland, the storm weakened and began to take a northeastward trajectory toward the Chesapeake Bay, downgrading to a tropical storm over Georgia, and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over southern Virginia late on October 11. Michael subsequently strengthened into a powerful extratropical cyclone and eventually impacted the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on October 16. At least 74 deaths were attributed to the storm, including 59 in the United States and 15 in Central America. Michael caused an estimated $25.1\u00a0billion (2018\u00a0USD) in damages,[2] including $100\u00a0million in economic losses in Central America,[3] damage to U.S. fighter jets with a replacement cost of approximately $6\u00a0billion at Tyndall Air Force Base,[4] and at least $6.23\u00a0billion in insurance claims in the U.S.[5][6] Losses to agriculture alone exceeded $3.87\u00a0billion.[7][8] As a tropical disturbance, the system caused extensive flooding in Central America in concert with a second disturbance over the eastern Pacific Ocean. In Cuba, the hurricane's winds left over 200,000\u00a0people without power as the storm passed to the island's west. Along the Florida panhandle, the cities of Mexico Beach and Panama City suffered the worst of Michael, incurring catastrophic damage from the extreme winds and storm surge. Numerous homes were flattened and trees felled over a wide swath of the panhandle. A maximum wind gust of 139\u00a0mph (224\u00a0km/h) was measured at Tyndall Air Force Base before the sensors failed. As Michael tracked across the Southeastern United States, strong winds caused extensive power outages across the region.",
      "Meteorological history": "A large area of disturbed weather spawned over the mid-to-western Caribbean Sea around October\u00a01\u20132, 2018, and absorbed the remnants of Tropical Storm Kirk.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) anticipated on October\u00a02 that strong upper-level winds would prevent any significant development of the system for at least a couple of days.[9] On the same day, a tropical wave\u00a0\u2013  an elongated trough of low air pressure\u00a0\u2013  tracked into the area. This possibly led to an increase in thunderstorm activity which in turn gave rise to a surface low southwest of Jamaica on October\u00a03.[1] Although the low was initially predicted to travel northward,[10] it instead tracked west-southwestward and moved ashore in northeastern Honduras on October\u00a04. The low became incorporated into a broad cyclonic gyre which was located over Central America by October\u00a05. A center which was located over the eastern Pacific moved across Central America on October 6 and integrated into the gyre. The gyre's center reformed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on the same day.[1] Due to the imminent threat that the system posed to land, the NHC began issuing advisories on it as Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen around 21:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06. Meanwhile, an upper-level trough located over the Gulf of Mexico was imparting vertical wind shear over the system. Despite this, the system's convection or thunderstorm activity, as well as its circulation, were improving in organization on both satellite imagery and in surface observations.[11] The disturbance tracked generally northward within the southerly flow between a subtropical ridge which was located over the western Atlantic Ocean and a mid-latitude trough that was traveling eastward across the United States.[12] A tropical depression spawned around 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a07, approximately 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) south of Cozumel, Mexico.[1] Around that time, Belizean radar showed that convection was forming just northeast of the depression's low-level center. The nascent depression was located in an environment of strong wind shear and warm 82\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures.[13] Around 12:00\u00a0UTC, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, receiving the name Michael. During the next six hours, the center of the storm relocated to the northeast as a result of flaring convection in that region. The system proceeded to travel slightly east of north as it rounded the western periphery of a mid-level ridge that was located over the western Atlantic.[1] After becoming a tropical depression, Michael began a period of rapid intensification.[1] Initially, the NHC had predicted Michael to reach a peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) as wind shear was expected to persist for at least two days,[11] however, Michael became significantly stronger by the time it made landfall, reaching Category\u00a05 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Two factors may have helped to facilitate the cyclone's intensification; the first was diffluence or streamline divergence\u00a0\u2013 the elongating of a fluid body normal to the flow\u00a0\u2013  originating from an upper-level trough that was counteracting the wind shear. The second factor was that Michael's outflow entered another upper-level trough that was located east of the storm.[1] A WC-130 aircraft from the United States Air Force Reserve 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron discovered that Michael had been quickly intensifying as it surveyed the tropical cyclone in the afternoon and evening of October\u00a07, measuring peak stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) winds between 45 and 60\u00a0mph (72 and 97\u00a0km/h) during its mission.[14][15] Although Michael had strengthened to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08, most of the storm's convection remained displaced to its eastern side as a result of the wind shear. Microwave imagery, however, showed that the core of Michael had improved, with one banding feature curving around most of the storm.[1][15] The tropical storm continued to organize, with convection and outflow increasing in the western half of the system.[16] Michael became a Category\u00a01 hurricane around 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08.[1] An eye was beginning to appear in satellite imagery around the same time.[17] Around 18:30\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08, Michael reached its initial peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) as it tracked just west of Cabo del San Antonio, Cuba.[1] But overnight, Michael's eyewall began to degrade due to a cold water eddy, dry air incursion, and wind shear, signaling that the rapid intensification had ceased.[1][18] Shortly after, the hurricane's banding features began to improve as the system was located over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.[17][18] By 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a09, Michael had begun to rapidly intensify once more;[1] its eye had become better defined and outflow improved as the westerly shear decreased.[19] Meanwhile, the hurricane was tracking north-northwest due to a mid-level ridge. The tropical cyclone strengthened into a Category\u00a03 major hurricane[nb 2] by 18:00\u00a0UTC as cold convection developed over the eastern and southeastern regions of the storm and wrapped around its eyewall.[1][21] Cloud temperatures decreased to \u2212103\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221275\u00a0\u00b0C) in the central dense overcast and were as low as \u2212126\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221288\u00a0\u00b0C) in the eyewall.[22] Michael resumed a northward trek early on October\u00a010 as it traveled between the ridge and a mid-latitude shortwave trough. Outflow generated by the trough may have hastened Michael's rapid intensification until landfall.[1] The outer rainbands of Michael began to move ashore around 10:00\u00a0UTC, and the cyclone's eye continued to warm as it approached the Florida Panhandle, however, radar imagery showed a secondary eyewall was beginning to form.[23][24] The hurricane's direction shifted to the northeast under the influence of the westerlies. Michael reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 919\u00a0mbar (27.14\u00a0inHg) around 17:30\u00a0UTC on October\u00a010, as it made landfall near Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida.[1] Operationally, the NHC had reported Michael's landfall intensity as 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) based on flight-level winds of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) and SFMR readings between 152 and 159\u00a0mph (245 and 256\u00a0km/h).[25] However, some data from the SFMR instrument was missing and had to be reconstructed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Aircraft Operation Center. This data yielded a peak SFMR value of 175\u00a0mph (282\u00a0km/h) for the time that the reconnaissance aircraft surveyed the southern eyewall. Additionally, doppler weather radar from Eglin Air Force Base estimated peak winds of 178\u00a0mph (286\u00a0km/h) at 17:22\u00a0UTC, around the same location as the aircraft. The radar displayed that stronger winds existed northeast of the aircraft, outside its field of observation.[1] After moving ashore, Michael quickly became less intense; by 21:30\u00a0UTC on October\u00a010, just four hours after landfall, Michael had weakened below Category\u00a03 status before moving into southwestern Georgia.[1] Around that time, the hurricane was continuing to track northeast under the influence of the westerlies.[25] Doppler radar displayed that Michael had continued to degrade,[26] with the storm weakening into a high-end Category\u00a01 hurricane by 00:00\u00a0UTC.[1] At that time, the peak winds were confined to a region of convection near Michael's low-level center.[26] Six hours later, Michael fell to tropical storm intensity,[1] with only a small zone of storm-force winds existing near its center. Most of the peak winds were displaced to the southeast, over the Atlantic Ocean.[27] The storm entered South Carolina around 15:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a011. By that time, all of the gale-force winds associated with Michael were occurring over the Atlantic Ocean and along the shoreline.[1][28] As Michael entered North Carolina late on October\u00a011, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone.[1] Cold, dry air entrained into the storm's circulation. Winds increased northwest of the storm's elongating center, over the states of North Carolina and Virginia.[1][28] Michael became fully extratropical by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012 as it traveled east-northeastward, just north of Raleigh, North Carolina. Around that time, another low-level center with a lower pressure had formed farther north, near Chesapeake Bay, as baroclinic processes began to restrengthen the former hurricane.[29] The extratropical cyclone emerged into the Atlantic around 06:00\u00a0UTC after passing near Norfolk, Virginia. Michael obtained hurricane-force winds on October\u00a013 while in the Atlantic waters south of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. It quickly traveled to the northeastern Atlantic by October\u00a014.[1] The cyclone turned sharply southeastward and later southward around the northeastern edge of the ridge, weakening slightly, as it approached the Iberian Peninsula. Michael's remnant low dissipated by 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a016, while it was located just west of northern Portugal.[1] On the same day, Michael's extratropical remnant absorbed the remnants of Hurricane Leslie, which were situated to the east of Michael, following a brief Fujiwhara interaction; Michael's remnants subsequently dissipated shortly afterward.[30][31][32][33]",
      "Preparations": "",
      "Cuba": "About 70% of the offshore Isla de la Juventud lost power.[51] On the southern coast of the island, La Coloma was inundated by storm surge, sinking ships and flooding homes.[52] High winds left more than 200,000\u00a0people without power in the province of Pinar del R\u00edo,[53] accounting for 90% of the province.[54] Officials sent 500\u00a0power workers to the area to restore electricity.[53] Widespread damage was inflicted on tobacco crops, leading to the complete loss of 18,000\u00a0seedbeds of tobacco in the province; the hurricane struck Cuba coincident with the start of the sowing season for tobacco on October\u00a010. More than 600 hectares (1,500 acres) of rice were also damaged by Michael's rainfall. At least 694\u00a0homes in Cuba were damaged by the hurricane, including 300 in Sandino.[55]",
      "United States": "According to the Edison Electric Institute, at one point 1.2\u00a0million electricity customers were without power in several east coast and southern states.[57] Estimated damage from Michael throughout the United States reached $25\u00a0billion.[2]",
      "Impact": "",
      "Central America": "The combined effects of the precursor low to Michael and a disturbance over the Pacific Ocean caused significant flooding across Central America.[47] At least 15 fatalities occurred: eight in Honduras,[48] 4 in Nicaragua, and 3 in El Salvador.[47][49] In Honduras, torrential rain caused at least seven rivers to overtop their banks; nine communities became isolated. Heavy rains from Hurricane Michael forced hundreds of people from their homes in Honduras over the weekend as the intensifying storm continued its push towards the Gulf Coast. On October 7, the Permanent Commission of Contingencies said more than 260 homes were damaged in the southern part of the country. Some 6,000 people were impacted by flooding and landslides, according to the Associated Press. During a press conference earlier that day, Honduras president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez said at least 18 people were rescued during the storm. The storm forced the closure of schools nationwide on October 8.[50] More than 1,000\u00a0homes sustained damage, of which 9 were destroyed, affecting more than 15,000\u00a0people. Nationwide, 78\u00a0shelters housed displaced persons and relief agencies procured 36\u00a0tonnes of aid.[48] Nearly 2,000\u00a0homes in Nicaragua suffered damage, and 1,115\u00a0people were evacuated. A total of 253\u00a0homes were damaged in El Salvador.[47] Damage across the region exceeded $100\u00a0million.[3] Images circulated over social media depicting families wading through thigh-high water, rivers rushing onto streets and roads to communities cut off by mudslides. Local media in Honduras recorded several deaths. Homes in Honduras that were built close to waterways or wedged precariously on hillslides were vulnerable to being washed away by rain, and as a result, a lot of them were.[citation needed]",
      "Florida": "The National Centers for Environmental Information estimated that Michael caused $18.4\u00a0billion in damage in Florida, primarily incurred by property and infrastructure.[58] The most severe impacts occurred along the Florida coast between Panama City Beach and Cape San Blas,[58] with catastrophic impacts in the areas around Mexico Beach and Tyndall Air Force Base.[1] Impacts were evident on all types of buildings, though structures built before 2002 fared substantially worse.[59]:\u200a3\u200a Mobile homes in the regions affected by Michael were older and smaller than in other parts of the state and experienced significant to catastrophic impacts in the hardest-hit areas.[60] Damage to over 2.8\u00a0million acres (1.1\u00a0million hectares) of forested land caused an estimated $1.29\u00a0billion in damage to the timber industry; 12% of damaged forest area was classified as \"catastrophic\" by the Florida Forest Service.[61] Around 28\u00a0percent of global longleaf pine ecosystems were affected by the hurricane in Florida; near the storm's center, tree mortality was as high as 87.8\u00a0percent.[62] Damage to various agricultural sectors, chiefly cotton, cattle, and peanuts, amounted to $180\u00a0million.[63]:\u200a52\u200a Only 5-10% of the cotton crop had been harvested at the time of Michael's landfall, resulting in total losses of cotton where Category 3\u20134 hurricane winds were felt. Losses to the cattle industry stemmed largely from damage to farm infrastructure; an estimated 1,507\u00a0cattle ranches and 106,438\u00a0head of cattle were within the hurricane-force wind envelope of Michael.[64] Seven deaths were directly caused by the hurricane's forces, including five drownings due to storm surge and two deaths due to fallen trees; the drownings all involved elderly individuals. There were another 43\u00a0deaths indirectly caused by Michael, including those that occurred during the storm's aftermath and those from health complications exacerbated by the hurricane, resulting in 50\u00a0deaths total in Florida attributed to Michael.[1]:\u200a10\u201311 Based on post-storm analyses conducted by the National Hurricane Center synthesizing data from several data sources, Michael made landfall as a Category\u00a05 hurricane at Mexico Beach, near Tyndall Air Force Base at 12:30\u00a0pm. CDT (17:30\u00a0UTC) on October\u00a010. Its maximum sustained winds were estimated to be 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) upon moving ashore, making it the most intense hurricane landfall on record for the Florida Panhandle.[1]:\u200a18\u200a Michael was the only tropical cyclone known to have struck the Florida Panhandle at stronger than Category\u00a03 intensity, and the first Category\u00a05 hurricane to make landfall anywhere along the U.S. coast since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.[65][1]:\u200a6\u200a Three surface weather stations collected data from Michael's eyewall as it moved onshore; however, they either malfunctioned before the arrival of the storm's strongest winds or were positioned outside the radius of maximum wind, providing incomplete measurements and resulting in maximum values lower than expected from radar and aircraft reconnaissance data. The fastest 1-minute average wind measured by a surface-based anemometer was 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h) at a weather station within Tyndall Air Force Base; the same station recorded a peak wind gust of 139\u00a0mph (224\u00a0km/h). Another station on the base grounds, affixed to a tower, registered a 129\u00a0mph (208\u00a0km/h) gust before the tower toppled.[1]:\u200a5\u20136\u200a Michael continued to produce hurricane-force wind gusts near its center as it moved across the Florida Panhandle into Georgia; its center traversed the Panhandle in four hours. A 102\u00a0mph (164\u00a0km/h) gust was documented in Marianna, Florida.[1]:\u200a7 The combination of Michael's storm surge and the astronomical tide submerged normally dry areas under 9\u201314\u00a0ft (2.7\u20134.3\u00a0m) of water along the coast between Tyndall Air Force Base and Port St. Joe, Florida. Waves atop the elevated water levels caused additional damage and inundation.[1]:\u200a8\u200a Maximum inundation depths were further enhanced by St. Joseph Peninsula, which kept the storm surge elevated by preventing surge water from receding into the open gulf.[66]:\u200a1\u20137\u200a Storm surge inundation decreased farther west and east of the hurricane's point of landfall; along the Big Bend inundation heights were 6\u20139\u00a0ft (1.8\u20132.7\u00a0m), and towards Tampa Bay they diminished to 2\u20134\u00a0ft (0.61\u20131.22\u00a0m). Between Pensacola and Panama City, maximum storm surge inundation was also 2\u20134\u00a0ft (0.61\u20131.22\u00a0m).[1]:\u200a9\u200a The highest rainfall total from Michael in Florida occurred at Lynn Haven, where 11.62\u00a0in (295\u00a0mm) of rain was measured.[1]:\u200a9\u201310\u200a Higher rainfall totals were concentrated in eastern Washington County and western Jackson County; locations in the path of Michael's eyewall received 6\u201310\u00a0in (150\u2013250\u00a0mm) of rain while those in the hurricane's outer rainbands generally recorded 1\u20133\u00a0in (25\u201376\u00a0mm) of rain.[66]:\u200a1\u201311\u200a The impacts of inland flooding were lessened by Michael's quick path through the Florida Panhandle, occurring in localized areas.[58] Power outages affected nearly 400,000\u00a0electricity customers in Florida at their greatest extent, representing about 4% of the state.[67] Five counties experienced a complete loss of electrical power.[58]",
      "Bay County": "Catastrophic and widespread damage occurred in Bay County, where Michael made landfall; 45,000\u00a0structures were damaged and 1,500 were destroyed throughout the county.[1]:\u200a11\u200a Two hospitals\u2014Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center\u2014suffered significant damage.[58] Approximately 19.5\u00a0mi (31.4\u00a0km) of the 41.2\u00a0mi (66.3\u00a0km) Bay County coastline, which includes Panama City Beach and Mexico Beach, sustained critical beach erosion.[68]:\u200a14\u200a Sensor data and high water marks surveyed by the United States Geological Survey indicated that water inundation at Mexico Beach reached a depth of 14\u00a0ft (4.3\u00a0m) above ground level,[1]:\u200a8\u200a classifying Michael's surge at Mexico Beach as a 1-in-280\u00a0year event.[68]:\u200a15\u200a Mexico Beach was the community most heavily impacted by Hurricane Michael and experienced both the hurricane's maximum winds and surge;[69][70]:\u200a15\u200a Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long described the city as \"probably ground zero.\"[71] Of the 1,692\u00a0buildings in the city, 1,584\u00a0were damaged, and 809\u00a0among those were destroyed.[1]:\u200a10\u201311\u200a Waves augmented by the elevated waters damaged the second-stories of buildings and carried boats inland.[58][72] Along the immediate coast, the combination of surge and extreme winds whittled buildings down to piles of debris and left their concrete slab foundations exposed.[70]:\u200a15\u200a Those that remained intact were crumpled and contorted or were eventually razed by unattended fires that began during the storm.[72][73] Beach houses were severed from their pilings and the city's public pier succumbed to the intense surf.[74] Some staircases remained standing without their associated houses.[73] Debris from various razed structures accumulated on US 98,[70]:\u200a15\u200a whose pavement was partially washed out by Michael.[75] The road remained closed for nearly a year before repairs completed.[76] Boats were broken in half and 33-short-ton (30\u00a0t) rail cars were toppled.[77] It was estimated that as many as 285\u00a0residents of the small town may have stayed despite mandatory evacuations.[72] Three drownings occurred in or near Mexico Beach.[1]:\u200a10\u201311 Significant structural damage was wrought to Tyndall Air Force Base.[78] Due to the base's location on the left side of Michael's eye, damage there was primarily due to the force of the winds rather than storm surge.[79] Every building was damaged and many were considered a complete loss by the base administration; the base's marina was also destroyed.[80][1]:\u200a10\u201311\u200a[70]:\u200a16\u200a Of the damaged buildings, 484\u00a0were considered destroyed or beyond repair; $648\u00a0million was later allocated in repairs for the remaining structures.[81] Vehicles were tossed through parking lots and destroyed, and an McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon used for display were flipped and damaged.[82][83] Most hangars, including those that housed Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptors, were fully unroofed and battered by the strong winds.[79] The 17\u00a0Raptors that remained at the base remained relatively unscathed and were brought to airworthy condition within a few days.[84] The base's power, water, and sewage systems were downed,[85] rendering the base uninhabitable.[86]:\u200a15\u200a The flight line and drone runway was crippled.[80][82] The damage toll inflicted to installations at the base reached $3\u00a0billion.[1]:\u200a10\u201311\u200a Large forests in the area were almost entirely flattened to the ground, while trees that remained standing on and around the base were completely stripped and denuded. Three-fourths of the longleaf pine trees on the base were sheared in half, equating to $14\u00a0million in harvestable timber losses.[87][88] Parts of the gymnasium of a nearby elementary school were also unroofed.[58] An estimated ten to twenty thousand people were displaced by the storm in Panama City, of which one thousand remained at three area shelters.[89] The Panama City area was buffeted by gusts as high as 164\u00a0mph (264\u00a0km/h), inflicting roof damage and tearing the aluminum siding off of most homes and businesses; at least 90% of all structures and 69% of homes were damaged.[90][91][70]:\u200a16\u200a Further damage was caused by trees falling upon roofs.[70]:\u200a16\u200a A gas leak at an unroofed motel endangered guests who had sought shelter inside.[92] Nine people were rescued by a helicopter after their house's roof collapsed.[93] Cars, truck trailers, recreational vehicles, and trains were tossed around by the wind.[92][94] A high school's gymnasium had its roof peeled back and some of its interior walls blown apart.[95] Broken glass and snapped utility poles littered the city streets and parking lots.[96] Downed studio transmitter link towers and power outages resulted in the loss of nearly all television and radio stations in the Panama City region.[97] One collapsed tower tore a hole into the roof of the adjoining studio building.[98] Severe roof and siding damage was prevalent in Panama City Beach, where gusts reached 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[70]:\u200a16\u200a At least 98% of structures in Callaway were damaged and 300\u00a0properties were tagged as beyond repair by city officials. Nearby, 85% of residential properties and 90% of businesses were damaged in Lynn Haven.[91] The roof of a church was torn away in neighboring Southport.[99] Storm surge inundation exceeded 5.3\u00a0ft (1.6\u00a0m) along the coast in the Panama City area. Local marinas and boats docked in port were almost entirely destroyed.[70]:\u200a16\u200a One person drowned on the eastern side of the Panama City near East Bay.[1]:\u200a10",
      "Forgotten Coast and Apalachee Bay": "In addition to the Mexico Beach area, coastal communities in Franklin and Gulf counties\u2014collectively known as the \"Forgotten Coast\" due to a lack of infrastructure development in recent decades\u2014were among those hardest-hit by Michael.[70]:\u200a15\u200a A Florida Department of Environmental Protection survey identified 2,725\u00a0structures that sustained major flood damage in Bay, Gulf, Franklin, and Wakulla counties.[66]:\u200a1\u20139\u200a Over 2,000\u00a0structures sustained damage in Gulf County, with over 1,200\u00a0suffering major damage and 985 being destroyed. In Franklin County, 80\u00a0structures were destroyed.[1]:\u200a11\u200a Michael's storm surge created two inlets along St. Joseph Peninsula, cutting off vehicle access to a 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) stretch of the T.H. Stone Memorial St. Joseph Peninsula State Park and isolating 8\u00a0cabins and 119\u00a0campsites.[58][100] The onrush of water flattened the 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) dunes that once filled the park and left the boardwalk dilapidated.[100] The main access road to Cape San Blas was shredded into asphalt sheets.[101] Stretches of US 98 were washed out along the coast.[58] A thousand homes were destroyed by coastal flooding in Port St. Joe and every building sustained damage.[77][102] Forty homes were later demolished as their structural integrity declined. Many stores along the city's main street were flooded halfway up their first floors.[102][103] Storefronts were covered in sand piled up by the hurricane and homes and condos were displaced from their foundations.[104][102] The Port St. Joe marina was severely damaged, contributing to the 400\u00a0vessels lost in Gulf and Bay counties.[104] Boats from the marina were forced inland onto a parking lot 300\u00a0yd (270\u00a0m) from the docks.[103] The failure of 15\u00a0pumping stations hamstrung the city's ability to eliminate wastewater.[104] Power lines and crumpled amalgamations of cars lay strewn across roads.[105] Power poles and campers were knocked over in the adjacent community of Highland View.[103] While Michael's storm surge flooded downtown Apalachicola, the city's buildings weathered the storm with generally minor damage.[106] However, the city was isolated due to the disheveled state of US 98,[107] with parts of the road blocked by felled oak and pine trees and other parts submerged under the advancing seawater. The anemometer at Apalachicola Regional Airport registered gusts of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) before being blown away.[108] Sections of St. George Island were deeply inundated, and the island may have been entirely underwater during the storm. Although located farther from the storm than St. George Island, homes in Carrabelle sustained more severe damage due to their older and less-elevated construction, resulting in significant flood damage.[109] The road connecting Carrabelle and St. George Island was washed out every few hundred feet.[110] Along the coast of Franklin County from Alligator Point to Bald Point, the roofs of several homes were blown away; beach erosion also occurred throughout the extent. Four homes and an inn on Dog Island were destroyed.[111] As Michael's waves repeatedly battered Dog Island, some of the 15\u00a0ships wrecked by the 1899 Carrabelle hurricane became exposed.[112] Owing to the concave geometry of Apalachicola Bay, the 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m) storm surge produced by Michael along the coast Wakulla County was particularly damaging. There, the hurricane was considered most damaging in recent memory. Entire communities were swamped by the surge. In St. Marks, the depth of inundation reached 4\u20135\u00a0ft (1.2\u20131.5\u00a0m), with the floodwaters pressing farther inland than in prior storms. Most of the county's electricity customers lost power during Michael's passage. Fallen trees rendered roads impassable.[113]",
      "Elsewhere in Florida": "Strong winds from Michael penetrated inland, causing widespread damage to infrastructure and agricultural and forestry interests. Four hundred buildings were destroyed in Jackson County and major damage was inflicted upon another six hundred.[1]:\u200a11\u200a Numerous trees and power lines were downed county-wide.[114] Some businesses in Marianna were unroofed, leading to further collapse of exterior walls.[58] The stone fa\u00e7ades of buildings in the courthouse square were reduced to rubble. The headquarters of Jackson County's road department collapsed and shopping centers and restaurants suffered heavy damage.[114] One person died in Quincy and another in Alford to felled trees.[1]:\u200a10\u200a Strong winds in the heavily forested regions in and around Tallahassee resulted in the widespread downing of trees, forcing the closure of over 125\u00a0roads in the city as well as an 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) segment of I-10 between Tallahassee and Lake Seminole. Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee\u2014Florida's oldest largest psychiatric hospital\u2014was cut off from the outside world due to power disruptions, forcing aid to be dropped by helicopter.[115] Though localized, acute flooding resulted from Michael's rain swath. Record flooding occurred along Econfina Creek, overtopping a SR 20 bridge.[58] Near Bennett, the creek rose from below action stage to flood stage in under six hours after 5\u20139\u00a0in (130\u2013230\u00a0mm) of rain fell within its watershed.[63]:\u200a51\u200a Moderate flooding along the Chipola River near Altha damaged homes downstream and inflicted significant damage to fish camps.[58] Sustained winds in coastal Okaloosa County, located west of Michael's landfall, met low-end tropical storm thresholds, punctuated by higher 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) gusts. Gusts in the tropical storm range extended west to Pensacola and farther inland along the westernmost stretches of the Florida Panhandle, downing trees and power lines.[63]:\u200a53\u200a However, the overall impacts of Michael west of Bay County were comparatively muted.[116] On the evening of October\u00a010, 308\u00a0customers were without power in Escambia County. Isolated power outages also afflicted Okaloosa County.[117] Gusts in the Pensacola area topped out at 44\u00a0mph (71\u00a0km/h) and reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in Destin. The Navarre Causeway and the Garcon Point Bridge briefly closed as winds exceeded 39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h).[118] Storm surge inundation of 2\u20132.5\u00a0ft (0.61\u20130.76\u00a0m) in the Pensacola area occurred ahead of the hurricane due to strong easterly winds, producing minor flooding. Significant beach erosion and road damage was caused by 10\u201315\u00a0ft (3.0\u20134.6\u00a0m) waves along SR 399 between Pensacola Beach and Navarre. Several piers on Choctawhatchee Bay were damaged or destroyed.[63]:\u200a53\u200a Neighborhoods along the Santa Rosa Sound were in Pensacola Beach were flooded as the rough surf flowed over barriers.[119] The outer fringes of Michael affected parts of the peninsular region of Florida well before its ultimate landfall. The combined wind flow from Michael's large circulation and an area of high pressure to the north generated squalls with 35\u201340\u00a0mph (56\u201364\u00a0km/h) gusts over central Florida on October\u00a08; at the time, Michael was located near the western end of Cuba. One boat sank in Lake Monroe due to rough waters generated by the squalls, killing one person and hospitalizing another.[63]:\u200a50\u200a Minor saltwater flooding occurred along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of South Florida due to high tides enhanced by storm surge.[63]:\u200a52 Storm surge was responsible for most of the $100,000 damage toll along the coasts of west-central and southwestern Florida. Storm surge topped out at 4.52\u00a0ft (1.38\u00a0m) at Cedar Key. Similar surge heights occurred in Citrus County, forcing several road closures and washing away a car parked on a road ramp at Fort Island Gulf Beach. Tropical storm-force winds were also felt in isolated areas in the region. A National Ocean Service station in Cedar Key recorded a 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) sustained wind, the highest reported in the region. Cedar Key experienced the worst effects from Michael along the west and southwestern coasts of the Florida peninsula. Two homes and two businesses experienced stormwater inundation, in addition to another four homes in nearby Yankeetown; each building sustained minor damage amounting to roughly $10,000 per building. Michael's outer rainbands spawned at least four waterspouts; one briefly moved ashore Sarasota County 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) northwest of Siesta Key and was classified as an EF0\u00a0tornado. Another EF0\u00a0tornado was spotted by law enforcement near Camp Blanding.[63]:\u200a53",
      "Georgia": "Michael crossed into Georgia in Donalsonville as a weakening, but still strong Category\u00a02 hurricane, where significant damage to structures and trees occurred.[120] Gusts in Donalsonville peaked at 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[121] Tropical storm force wind gusts were observed as far north as Athens and Atlanta. More than 400,000\u00a0electrical customers in Georgia were left without power. At least 127\u00a0roads throughout the state were blocked by fallen trees or debris.[120] In Albany, where wind gusts reached 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h),[122] 24,270\u00a0electrical customers lost power. Numerous trees fell on homes and roads, blocking about 100\u00a0intersections. Winds also ripped siding off of homes and shattered windows at the convention center. Three tornadoes were spawned by Michael in Georgia,[121] including a high-end EF1\u00a0tornado in Crawford County that knocked down several trees onto homes and destroyed.[123] An 11-year-old girl in Seminole County died after debris fell on her home.[120] Agriculture across the state suffered tremendous losses. As of October\u00a018, estimated damage in the agriculture industry alone reached $2.38\u20132.89\u00a0billion. Forestry experienced the greatest losses at $1\u00a0billion, with about 1\u00a0million acres of trees destroyed. Described as a \"generational loss\", pecan farms in many areas were wiped out.[7] The Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Georgia estimated that the pecan crop suffered $100\u00a0million in direct losses, with another $260\u00a0million in direct losses associated with damage to pecan trees.[124] Farmers were still recovering from damage incurred by Hurricane Irma during the preceding year. The entire crop in Seminole County was lost and 85\u00a0percent was lost in Decatur. Initially expected to be a record harvest, a large portion of the cotton crop\u2014worth an estimated $300\u2013800\u00a0million\u2014was wiped out. $480\u00a0million worth of vegetables were destroyed. In the poultry industry, more than 2\u00a0million chickens died due to the storm, and the loss were about $25\u00a0million.[7] The insurance claims throughout the state were about $700\u00a0million.[6]",
      "Elsewhere": "Four EF0\u00a0tornadoes were spawned in South Carolina, all of which caused minor tree damage.[125] Moisture streaming northward ahead of Michael led to heavy rainfall across North Carolina on October\u00a011, with most occurring in the basins of the New and Watauga river basins. Most of the rain fell in three to six hours, triggering flash floods. Rainfall totals were generally 4\u20138\u00a0in (100\u2013200\u00a0mm) with some localized maxima in excess of 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm).[63]:\u200a139\u2013140\u200a As the cyclone itself passed through North Carolina, it produced wind gusts of 40\u201360\u00a0mph (64\u201397\u00a0km/h) across the central region of the state, blowing down trees onto roads and electric lines;[63]:\u200a138\u200a 490,000\u00a0Duke Energy customers were left without power late on October\u00a011, and 342,000 remained without power in the state 24\u00a0hours later.[126] A tree fell on a car in Statesville, killing the driver.[127] Two others died in Marion when they crashed into a tree that had fallen across a road.[128] Fallen trees damaged homes and hotels in the Research Triangle.[129] The total cost of damage in central North Carolina reached $7.15\u00a0million.[63]:\u200a137\u200a Winds were stronger along the coast, with a peak gust of 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h) measured in Kitty Hawk. The northern Outer Banks experienced minor shingle damage and isolated tree damage as a result of these winds, with Manteo, Kill Devil Hills, and Kitty Hawk experiencing the heaviest impacts from both these winds and storm surge along the Outer Banks.[63]:\u200a139 In Virginia, seven tornadoes touched down: four were rated\u00a0EF0 and three were rated\u00a0EF1. The three EF1\u00a0tornadoes struck Burkeville, Mannboro, and Toana, blowing roofs off buildings and knocking down trees, some onto homes. A house in Mannboro was shifted slightly off its foundation and had most of its roof uplifted.[130] Flash Flood Emergencies were issued for both Roanoke and Danville on October 11.[131] Four people including a firefighter were washed away by floodwaters, and another firefighter was killed in a vehicle collision on Interstate 295.[132] A sixth fatality was discovered when the body of a woman was found on October 13.[133] At least 1,200\u00a0roads were closed, and hundreds of trees were downed. Up to 600,000\u00a0people were left without power at the height of the storm.[128] In Maryland, the remnants of Michael dropped 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) of rain over a period of a few hours in Wicomico County on October\u00a011. Flooding from the Rockawalkin Creek damaged a portion of MD 349, forcing the road to be closed.[134] Homes were flooded in the Canal Woods neighborhood in Salisbury.[135] Three hundred people were forced to evacuate from three apartments in the neighborhood.[136] Michael's remnants also generated strong winds across Maryland, with sustained winds topping out at 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) with gusts reaching 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h).[63]:\u200a109 Further north, wind gusts reached as high as 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) at Lewes Beach, Delaware and 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) at Atlantic City Airport in New Jersey. Heavy rainfall was also present in this region, with 3.83\u00a0in (97\u00a0mm) of rain in Georgetown, Delaware, 3.03\u00a0in (77\u00a0mm) in Millville, New Jersey, 2.58\u00a0in (66\u00a0mm) in Atlantic City and 2.29\u00a0in (58\u00a0mm) in Islip, New York.[137]",
      "Aftermath": "On October 9\u2014a day before Hurricane Michael made landfall\u2014President Donald Trump signed an emergency declaration for Florida, which authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster efforts, with Thomas McCool serving as Federal Coordinating Officer in the state. The declaration also authorized funding for 75% of the cost of emergency protective measures and the removal of storm debris in 14 Florida counties. The federal government also provided for 75% of the cost of emergency protective measures in an additional 21\u00a0counties.[140] On October 11, President Trump declared a major disaster in five counties: Bay, Franklin, Gulf, Taylor, and Wakulla. Residents in the county were able to receive grants for house repairs, temporary shelter, loans for uninsured property losses, and business loans.[141] In addition to FEMA, several private and non-profit organizations, including the DSA, PSL, and SRA, established the Hurricane Michael Relief Network which provided direct relief to residents that were affected by the disaster.[142] Due to the storm damage in Georgia, President Trump also signed an emergency declaration for Georgia, where FEMA activity was coordinated by Manny J. Torro. The declaration authorized funding for 75% of the cost of emergency protective measures and the removal of storm debris in 31\u00a0Georgia counties, and 75% of the cost of emergency protective measures in an additional 77\u00a0counties.[143] Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has since requested, with the storm's elevation to Category 5, the federal relief share be increased from 75% to 90%.[144] As of April 2019, either value awaits passage of a specific relief package being delayed in the United States House of Representatives.[145]",
      "Records": "With maximum sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 919\u00a0mbar (27.14\u00a0inHg) at landfall, Michael was the most intense landfalling mainland U.S. hurricane since Camille in 1969, which had a central pressure of 900\u00a0mbar (26.58\u00a0inHg) at landfall. Hurricane Michael was the first landfalling Category\u00a05 Atlantic hurricane in the U.S. since Andrew in 1992, which had 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h) winds.[150] Michael is tied with the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane for the sixth-strongest tropical cyclone by wind speed to impact the United States (including its overseas territories), and was the fourth strongest to impact the U.S. mainland.[151][non-primary source needed] Additionally, Michael was the second-most intense hurricane by pressure to make landfall in Florida, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, and the third strongest by wind, behind the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Andrew.[152] Michael was the second-most intense hurricane to have made landfall during the month of October in the North Atlantic basin (including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea), behind the 1924 Cuba hurricane.[153] Michael was the first recorded Category\u00a04 or 5 hurricane to strike the Florida Panhandle since reliable records began in 1851.[154][non-primary source needed]",
      "Retirement": "Due to the extreme damage and loss of life the storm caused along its track, particularly in the Florida Panhandle and southwest Georgia, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Michael from its rotating name lists in March 2019, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Milton for the 2024 season.[155][156]",

      "2006\u20132007 Southeast Asian floods": " The 2006\u20132007 Southeast Asian floods were a series of floods that mostly affected Malaysia from 18 December 2006 to 13 January 2007. The floods were caused by above average rainfall, which was attributed to Typhoon Utor (2006) which had hit the Philippines and Vietnam a few days earlier.[1] By the third week of January 2007, Johor had been affected by a larger flood. Singapore and certain parts of Indonesia were flooded due to the same typhoon. Throughout the week starting 18 December 2006,[2] a series of floods hit Johor, Malacca, Pahang and Negeri Sembilan. During this period, these southern Malaysian states, along with Singapore, experienced abnormally high rainfall which resulted in massive floods. The rainfall recorded in the city of Johor Bahru on 19 December amounted to 289mm compared to the average annual rainfall of the city which is 2400mm.[3][4] In Singapore, the 24-hour rainfall recorded on 20 December was 366\u00a0mm, the third highest recorded rainfall in 75 years.[5] The flooding began when torrential downpours since Sunday caused rivers and dams to overflow. Weather officials described the flooding as the worst in the area in a century.[6] At least six people died.[7] Later that week, beginning 22 December, North Sumatra experienced abnormally high rainfall which also caused flooding.[8]",
      "Causes[edit]": "Typhoon Utor was blamed for heavy rains of up to 350\u00a0mm within 24 hours in southern Peninsular Malaysia, specifically Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Malacca and Pahang, causing massive floods within the southern region on 18 December 2006, which were considered as the worst in the history of the southern region of Malaysia.[9] However, there were also reports a few days earlier that adverse weather was not to be blamed on the typhoon.[10] The worst-affected areas were Segamat and Kota Tinggi, where both towns were totally inaccessible via land transport routes after all main roads leading to those towns were flooded.[11] As of 4 January 2007, the floods had claimed 15 lives. Heavy rains were expected in Penang, Perak, Kelantan and other states in the northern region during this period.[12]",
      "Areas affected[edit]": "",
      "Indonesia[edit]": "The floods affected areas such as Aceh and North Sumatra, leaving many homeless. The floods lasted for a week starting on December 22. An estimated 400,000 people were displaced at the peak of the flooding with at least 118 people dead and 155 people missing as of 29 December 2006.[13]",
      "Malaysia[edit]": "",
      "Johor[edit]": "Several districts in Johor including Batu Pahat, Johor Bahru, Kluang, Kota Tinggi, Mersing, Muar, Pontian and Segamat were flooded. Between 60,000 and 70,000 people had been evacuated in the state while food shortage at relief centres had been reported. Flooded roads disrupted the delivery of aid to flood centres.[14] Most of the flood victims had been living without clean water or electricity for days.[15] According to health authorities, reports of water-borne diseases were on the rise.[15] In some areas, looting was reported after floodwaters receded.[16] The second bout of flooding, which was larger than the first one, had almost paralysed Johor after all 8 districts were submerged by the flood.[17] The areas worst affected by the second flood were Batu Pahat and Kluang. Both waves of the flood disaster were considered as the costliest flood in Malaysian history, with the total cost of damage caused by the floods standing at RM 1.5 billion.[18] In the early morning of 12 January 2007, floodwaters were slowly rising at Jalan Jaffar in Kota Tinggi, while the residents were all shifting their goods in preparation for the second flood. In the morning of 13 January 2007 around 4:00\u00a0a.m., the Sungai Semberong bridge at Batu 5, Jalan Kluang-Mersing  (Federal route 50) collapsed after being washed by strong currents.[19]",
      "Malacca[edit]": "In Malacca, 3,193 people from 691 families from Melaka Tengah, Alor Gajah and Jasin left their homes due to rising waters. A total of 35 relief centres were opened, with the floods regarded the worst for the three districts in 15 years.",
      "Pahang[edit]": "In Pahang, more than 2,000 people were evacuated in several areas in Rompin, especially in Bandar Tun Abdul Razak. After more than 10 hours of continuous rain, people in Kampung Rekoh in Bandar Tun Abdul Razak were evacuated to nearby community halls. Other affected areas were Kampung Kurnia, Yayasan Estate and Yayasan Estate II. More than 6,000 residents, including settlers in nine Felda Selancar schemes, were also stranded because of two badly damaged bridges in the area.",
      "Negeri Sembilan[edit]": "In Negeri Sembilan, the various government departments in charge of flood relief in the state were fully prepared and on standby, said Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan. Flooded areas include Gemas and Gemencheh and a total of 80 people have been evacuated so far.",
      "Singapore[edit]": "Continuous heavy rain since Monday, 18 December drenched Singapore, resulting in the third highest rainfall of 366mm recorded on Tuesday. The heaviest rain Singapore recorded was 512.4mm on 2 December 1978, followed by 469mm in December 1969. Severe floods affected areas such as Thomson, Mandai and Olive Road, severely affecting the business in Goodwood Florist as it is a low lying area. By 11pm, floodwaters have subsided in all flooded areas of Singapore except Olive Road.[20]",
      "Reactions[edit]": "",
      "Prime Minister's response[edit]": "Malaysian Prime Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi expressed his sadness over the disaster.[21] When the flooding started, he just finished a 3-day visit to Venezuela and had just left for a vacation.[22] He was back in Malaysia by 23 December 2006.[citation needed]",
      "Disaster Relief[edit]": "Several government agencies and NGOs provided assistance and aid to the victims during and after the floods. The Malaysian Red Crescent Society distributed hygiene kits to victims. The organisation also deployed several boats to the affected areas.[23] MERCY Malaysia deployed 78 volunteers and also appealed for public donations to assist the victims.[24] The Tzu Chi Foundation mobilised over 4,200 volunteers from both Malaysia and Singapore and have helped over 46,000 flood victims in 4 states.[25]",
      "International response[edit]": "Aid was given to Malaysia by various international non-governmental organisations and countries such as United Sikhs, Red Crescent, United States of America, and Taiwan. [citation needed] The Singapore Red Cross Society sent volunteers to assist in the state of Johor. The society also sent aid worth RM22,600.[26] The United States government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided $50,000 through the U.S. Embassy to the Malaysian Red Crescent to support emergency relief efforts.[27] The IFRC allocate CHF 50,000 (US$41,425) from the Federation's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) on 25 December 2006 to support the Malaysian Red Crescent's initial relief efforts.[28]",

      "Cyclone Raja": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Raja was a tropical cyclone that holds the 24-hour rainfall record of 674.9\u00a0mm (26.57\u00a0in) for the French Overseas Territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system was first noted by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) as a weak tropical disturbance northeast of Tokelau in mid-December 1986. The system developed further as it moved southwest over the next few days, and it was classified as Tropical Cyclone Raja on 23 December. The newly named system slowed and unexpectedly recurved southeast towards the French territory of Wallis and Futuna on 24 December. Over the next two days, Raja interacted with what would become Severe Cyclone Sally and executed a tight loop, passing within 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) of Futuna. The system peaked as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on 28 December, with estimated 10-minute sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). The storm turned southwest the next day and threatened Fiji, where it passed within 20\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) of Vanua Levu and near (or over) several smaller islands in the Lau group during the following day. Raja gradually weakened over the next few days as it moved south of Fiji; it was last noted on 5 January 1987 after it filled up over the north Tasman Sea. Raja caused one death as it impacted the island nations of Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna, Tonga and Fiji. Gusty winds and rough seas associated with the system caused extensive damage to crops, coastal installations and buildings in Tuvalu, and flooded low-lying areas. The island of Futuna was the worst hit, with crops, coastal installations and buildings damaged or destroyed by the system. Raja affected the main islands of Fiji twice between 24 and 30 December, and was responsible for the worst flood of the Labasa River since 1929. As a result of the damage to Fiji and portions of Polynesia, the name Raja was retired from the South Pacific naming lists.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The South Pacific convergence zone was active in the middle of December 1986, with a mid-latitude upper-level trough of low pressure which extended into the tropics.[1] A westerly wind burst between Tokelau and Kanton Island resulted in a tropical disturbance developing to the northeast of Tokelau.[1] The Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began to monitor the disturbance as a shallow tropical depression on 21 December, when the system was about 280\u00a0km (175\u00a0mi) east of the island of Funafuti, Tuvalu.[nb 1][3][4] At that time, the system was beyond the range of any reporting stations; its circulation was weak and ill-defined, which meant that there was considerable uncertainty about the location of its center.[3] The depression moved southwest and passed near the Tuvaluan atoll of Nukufetau, as it slowly deepened and organised over the next 36 hours.[3] After the system was named Tropical Cyclone Raja by the FMS on 23 December; the United States Naval Western Oceanography Center (NWOC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 04P.[nb 2][5][6] During that day, the system slowed as it approached Rotuma; the subtropical ridge of high pressure weakened, and widespread falling pressure was recorded across the Pacific.[1][3] Raja then unexpectedly re-curved southeast and began moving towards the French territory of Wallis and Futuna on 24 December.[1][3] Satellite imagery the next day indicated that the system had developed an eye, and it passed within 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) of Futuna.[3][7] Raja reached hurricane strength on 26 December, as it slowed and began to interact with what would become Severe Tropical Cyclone Sally.[1][8] Over the next two days, Raja approached to within 1,110\u00a0km (690\u00a0mi) of Sally in an anticlockwise cyclonic loop as it continued to intensify.[9] The system also passed about 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi) southeast of Futuna, as it re-curved east and began to threaten Fiji.[3][7] The FMS estimated on 28 December that Raja had peaked with 10-minute sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h), which made it a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.[4] The system turned southwest that day, in response to a trough of low pressure developing over (and south of) Raja and Sally.[1][3] It passed within 20\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) of Cikobia and Udu Point on Vanua Levu on 29 December, before it passed over or near several smaller Fijian islands in the Lau Group while beginning to turn south.[3] The NWOC estimated that Raja had peaked in intensity at this time with one-minute sustained wind speeds of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), which made it equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.[4] Over the next few days, Raja gradually weakened as it moved over cooler waters south of Fiji and its outflow became restricted before it degenerated into a depression during 1 January.[3] The depression subsequently passed under a subtropical jet and moved west, where it became part of a blocking pattern over New Zealand.[1] The system was last noted on 5 January, after filling over the north Tasman Sea.[1]",
      "Effects[edit]": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Raja was responsible for a single death as it impacted Fiji and parts of Polynesia, before its name was later retired from the South Pacific lists of tropical cyclone names.[6][2] When the FMS began monitoring Raja as a tropical depression on 21 December, they issued a tropical cyclone alert for Tuvalu.[3] Although the system moved southwest and affected Tuvalu as expected, it failed to deepen as quickly as anticipated. However, its strong, gusty winds and high seas caused extensive damage to crops, coastal installations and buildings and flooded low-lying areas on the island nation.[3][10] Raja was expected to begin moving southeast after it passed near Rotuma on 24 December, which prompted the FMS to issue a tropical cyclone alert for the Tongan islands of Niuafo\u02bbou and Keppel.[3] Gale warnings were issued on 25 December for the two islands and remained in place until 28 December, when the system had turned southwest and moved well away from the islands.[3] A tropical cyclone alert was issued for the islands of southern Tonga on 29 December, when the possibility arose that Raja would turn southeast and affect central and southern Tonga.[3] A gale warning was subsequently issued for Tongatapu and the Nomuka group of islands before all warnings for Tonga were cancelled on 30 December.[3]",
      "Wallis and Futuna[edit]": "Raja impacted the French overseas territory of Wallis and Futuna on 25\u201329 December, and was responsible for one death as well as extensive damage to the islands' crops, coastal installations and buildings.[13][11][14][15] A storm warning was issued by the FMS for Futuna on 24 December and remained in place until 28 December while the system made a cyclonic loop near the island.[3] The system brought gale-force winds to Wallis, and was thought to have brought hurricane-force winds to Futuna; this could not be verified since the weather station was blown down.[6] It also generated high seas, flooding, landslides and a storm surge which damaged Futuna's grass airstrip.[6][16][17] On 26 December, a record 24-hour rainfall total of 674.9\u00a0mm (26.57\u00a0in) and a minimum pressure of 969.2 hectopascals (28.62\u00a0inHg) were recorded at the Maopoopo weather station on Futuna.[11][18] The Maopoopo station also recorded a wind gust of 133\u00a0km/h (83\u00a0mph) before its anemometer was destroyed, and a record wind gust of 137\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) was recorded in Wallis' Hihifo District.[7][18][19] The record was broken during Severe Tropical Cyclone Evan in December 2012, when a wind gust of 156\u00a0km/h (97\u00a0mph) was recorded at the Hihifo aerodrome.[19] Communications between the islands were lost on 27 December, before an intermittent radio link was established later that day to transmit damage reports.[20] The reports indicated that Futuna was the worst affected, with severe damage reported to well-built houses; less well-built houses were completely destroyed.[6][20] About 80 percent of the island's crops were destroyed, and the territorial administration building, police headquarters and hospital were severely damaged.[6][20] The radio link failed on 28 December and Futuna was cut off from the rest of the world.[21][22] Relief supplies, including food, medical supplies and other materials, were immediately dispatched from French Polynesia and New Caledonia.[14] Two Transall military transport aircraft attempting to deliver 16 tonnes (16,000\u00a0kg) of relief materials to Futuna were diverted to Wallis due to poor visibility.[16][21][22] Plans were made to transport some of the aid on the cargo ship Mona-III when the seas surrounding the islands subsided.[22] Aid arrived on Futuna on 31 December after a dismantled Puma aircraft was airlifted to Wallis from New Caledonia, reassembled and flown to the island.[21][23] The aircraft, which also carried French Secretary of State for the South Pacific Gaston Flosse, evacuated seriously injured individuals to Wallis.[23][24] On 1 January, the French Navy ship Jacques-Cartier left Noumea with earth-moving equipment for Futuna.[24] During a 24-hour visit to the island nation on 6\u20137 February 1987, French Minister of Overseas Departments and Territories Bernard Pons announced that Futuna would receive FF55\u00a0million (US$8\u00a0million) in aid and the ban on aid to Vanuatu was overturned.[nb 3][26][27] A military detachment was deployed to the islands to assist in rehabilitating the main infrastructure the day after the minister's visit.[14] The European Economic Community supplemented the French funds, providing \u20a060,000 from the European Development Fund for Construction and enabling the replacement of fishing boats destroyed by the cyclone.[14] It took the island nation about five years to rebuild and recover from Raja's effects.[28]",
      "Fiji[edit]": "Raja impacted Fiji between 24 and 30 December, where it was responsible for FJ$16\u00a0million (US$14\u00a0million) in damage, one death and the worst flood of the Labasa River since 1929.[3][29] It was considered to be one of the worst tropical cyclones on record to hit Fiji.[30] On 23 December, the FMS issued a tropical cyclone alert for the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and warned that gale-force winds were possible on the island within the next 24 hours.[3] The FMS issued a storm warning for Rotuma and a tropical cyclone alert for the rest of Fiji later that day, since it was thought that the system would continue moving southeast towards the island nation.[3][31] Raja passed west of Rotuma on 24 December, and gale-force winds and extensive damage to houses, vehicles, coastal roads and crops were reported.[3][32][33] The tropical cyclone alert was gradually replaced that day with a gale warning for islands in Fiji's Northern Division the following day, since Raja was expected to pass close enough to trigger gale-force winds.[3] The system passed 90\u2013110\u00a0km (55\u201370\u00a0mi) northwest of the Udu Point meteorological station on 25 December, with estimated winds of 45\u201355\u00a0km/h (30\u201335\u00a0mph).[3] All warnings were gradually cancelled by the FMS on 25 and 26 December, as Raja moved east towards the Tongan island of Niuafo'ou.[3] It became clear that the storm posed another threat to Fiji on 27 December, since it had begun moving west the previous day.[3] Fiji was put on alert and the FMS issued gale warnings for several islands, including northern Vanua Levu, Cikobia, Qelelevu and Taveuni.[3] The National Emergency Services Committee was mobilised that day to coordinate incoming data and oversee preparations for Raja.[34][35] The FMS issued gale, storm and hurricane warnings for the island nation, while public and private broadcasting companies coordinated to disseminate information about Raja by radio over the next few days.[3] Residents of the archipelago went to caves or evacuation centres, which were thought to be strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds.[36][37] Severe damage was reported in areas of Fiji which received hurricane-force winds, including parts of Vanua Levu, the Koro and the Lau group of islands.[3] Other parts of the island nation also incurred damage from a combination of gale- to hurricane-force winds, a storm surge of 2\u20133 metres (6.6\u20139.8\u00a0ft), heavy rain and wind waves.[6] Severe damage was reported to crops, communication facilities, buildings, roads, seawalls, wharves, jetties and other coastal installations in low-lying areas.[6] Damage to houses were reportedly less severe than in previous tropical cyclones, which was attributed by the Fijian minister for home affairs to better-constructed homes which had replaced those destroyed by previous storms.[38] One person drowned on the island of Lakeba as he and two others tried to move a boat to a safer anchorage.[39] Raja was responsible for the worst flooding of the Labasa River since December 1929, with the gauge at Labasa's civic centre peaking at 3.72\u00a0m (12.2\u00a0ft).[40] The flooding in Labasa was later attributed to a blocked drainage system and exceptionally high tides.[40] A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion plane flew to Fiji on 31 December, enabling Fijian authorities to conduct aerial surveys and damage assessments on 1 and 2 January.[41][42] The flights indicated that damage to the island nation was less widespread than feared.[41] A half-submerged ferry was found on a reef near the island of Nairai; it was later identified by Fijian authorities as the Romada, which had taken 60 passengers to the island for Christmas.[43][44] The ferry sank with only the captain and the engineer aboard, and they reached shore in a life raft.[44] On 2 January, the Fijian government announced its willingness to accept assistance and made specific requests for relief.[38] United States Ambassador Carl Edward Dillery exercised his disaster-assistance authority, donating US$25,000 to the government of Fiji.[38] Other donations included about FJ$100,000 from New Zealand, AU$100,000 from Australia, AU$65,000 from the United Nations Development Programme and \u20a0300,000 from the European Commission.[44][45][46][47] On 5 January, World Vision Australia launched an appeal for AU$15,000 to send emergency food rations and other aid for 1,000 families to the island nation.[48] The funds were used for short-term relief from Raja's effects, and included the purchase of food supplies, transport, sanitation equipment and agricultural tools and equipment.[38] On 4 February, the Australian government announced that it would give AU$3.4\u00a0million to Fiji in addition to its previous emergency aid of AU$100 000.[49]",

      "Hurricane Frank (2010)": " Hurricane Frank was a Category 1 hurricane that caused minor damage in Mexico in late August 2010. The ninth tropical cyclone, sixth named storm, and third (and final) hurricane of the inactive 2010 Pacific hurricane season,[2] Frank formed from an area of thunderstorms from the Caribbean Sea, and became Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 21 while located just south of the Mexican Coast. It moved northwest, and became Tropical Storm Frank only 12 hours after it was declared a depression. It strengthened to its initial peak as a moderate tropical storm, and weakened due to increasing wind shear late on the August 23. It later recovered, and became a hurricane on August 25. After peaking as a strong Category 1 hurricane, it rapidly weakened, and dissipated on August 28. Although Frank never made landfall, it did impact western Mexico. A total of six people were killed with over 800,000 people affected.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Frank originated from a difficult to track tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa. A large area of thunderstorms formed near the Windward Islands. Atmosphere convection fluctuated as its associated tropical wave moved across the Caribbean Sea and a mid-level circulation developed. Shower and thunderstorm activity increased as it crossed Central America,[1] and a broad area of low pressure formed about 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) south of the Mexican coast on August 19.[3] The system was in a favorable environment, thus gradual development was anticipated.[4] On August 21, the atmospheric convection had become better organized,[5] and it develop curved rainbands. On 1800 UTC August 21, advisories were initiated on Tropical Depression Nine-E while located roughly 205\u00a0mi (330\u00a0km) southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico.[1] Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the storm was located in a favorable environment with sea surface temperatures near 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) and fairly weak wind shear. As such, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) anticipated the storm to reach minimal hurricane intensity.[6] Due to weak steering currents, the depression drifted westbound. Initially there was no change in organization, but on August 22, the cloud patterns improved. Based on estimates from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Frank on 1200 UTC August 22.[1] Although deep convection had weakened, the NHC re-assessed the intensity at 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) later that day.[7] However, high levels of northeasterly wind shear caused the system to weaken slightly the next day,[1] and by early August 24, the NHC was no longer forecasting the storm to become a hurricane.[8] Despite the shear, there was a burst of deep convection later that day and a gradual increase in organization. Microwave imagery at 0834 and 1714 UTC showed a closed ring of thunderstorm activity that resembled an eye and by early August 25, the cyclone was just below hurricane intensity.[1] During the next six hours, Frank became much better organized with a large area of very deep convection near the center. Based on this, the NHC upgraded the system into a hurricane.[9] Gradually intensifying, an eye became intermediately visible on infrared imagery and a persistent eye was visible via microwave imagery. On 1800 UTC, Frank reached its peak intensity of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg) while located 350\u00a0mi (560\u00a0km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. While at peak intensity, satellite imagery showed a small but distinct eye surrounded by a central dense overcast, or a large area of thunderstorm activity.[1] Moving west-northwest, Frank began a weakening trend overnight as the eye became less defined.[10] Continuing to weaken, Frank became less organized and its eye collapsed.[1] On August 27, the NHC downgraded Frank into a tropical storm, with poorly organized convection located west of the center due to strong wind shear. As such, the agency predicted the storm to weaken into a tropical depression within the next 36 hours.[11] Frank rapidly lost all thunderstorm activity because of cooler water, and the storms intensity was reduced to a swirl of clouds while it turned towards the north due to a mid-level trough.[1][12] The cyclone weakened back into a tropical depression early on August\u00a028. Frank degenerated into a remnant low while located 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The remnant low dissipated early on August\u00a029.[1]",
      "Preparations, impact, and aftermath[edit]": "Although Frank never made landfall, it did come very close to the Mexican Riviera, and upon development, a tropical storm watch was issued for parts of the Mexican coast by the local government. On 1800 UTC August 22, a tropical storm warning was issued. These watches and warnings were dropped on August 24 as the system moved away from the coast.[1] The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of up to 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) in the high terrain of Mexico. These rains had the potential to produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.[13] Officials gave Frank a hazard rating of intense for the Mexican Pacific, and strong for Baja California Sur.[14] In Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, and Jalisco, alerts were issued due to the threat of torrential rainfall.[15] Forecasters also noted the possibility of the storm affecting Sinaloa, with high waves being the main threat.[16] The maximum 24-hour rainfall total was 14\u00a0in (360\u00a0mm) in Miguel de la Madrid, Oaxaca. In addition, seven other sites received more than 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) of rain in a 24-hour period.[17] The storm also produced gusty conditions along the Mexican coast.[18] In addition, a total of six deaths were reported. A total 30 homes were destroyed with 26 others damaged due to flooding. Two major roads were damaged with another road blocked due to a landslides. Several rivers overflowed their banks,[19] thus causing 171 rural communities to be flooded in seven municipalities. In the state of Tabasco over 800,000 people were affected. The city of Villahermosa received the worst flood since 2007, and a total of 8,500 people were victims of the storm. To prevent the situation from getting worse, residents piled up sandbags.[14] In Oaxaca, four people were killed. A mudslide in the municipality of Totontepec Villa de Morelos caused two farmers to die. Another mudslide in Oaxaca caused six vehicles to drive off Federal Highway 182, causing two more deaths.[20] A total of 60,000 people were homeless. Many communities were isolated as several bridges and roads were destroyed due to the heavy rainfall.[15] In the aftermath of the storm, the Mexican Army provided aid for the people affected.[14] A total of 110 communities requested assistance from the government. By September\u00a014, an estimated 200,000 food packages were distributed to the region. Damage repairs from Hurricane Frank totaled to 100\u00a0million pesos (US$8.3\u00a0million).[21]",

      "Typhoon Nalgae (2011)": "Typhoon Nalgae, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Quiel, was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines, and it affected Hainan, China as a weak tropical storm. Nalgae was the eighth typhoon and the fourth super typhoon in 2011. Forming as the 32nd tropical depression of the season, the system formed on September 26 over the Philippine Sea. On September 27, it was named Nalgae as it explosively intensified into a typhoon on the next day. Nalgae reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 typhoon on September 30 while it made landfall over Luzon. Nalgae weakened into a tropical storm as it entered the South China Sea on October 1. Nalgae made landfall over the island of Guandong in China on October 4 as it weakened to a tropical depression. Nalgae dissipated on October 5 east of Vietnam.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On September 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor a weak tropical depression that had developed about 1,260\u00a0km (785\u00a0mi) to the northwest of Manila in the Philippines.[1] During that day, while the depression moved towards the northwest its low level circulation centre rapidly consolidated in an area of favourable conditions for further development of the system. This prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system early the next day.[2] However less than 3 hours later, the JTWC decided to issue advisories on the system designating it as Tropical Depression 22W, before the JMA reported that the depression had become a tropical storm and named it Nalgae.[1][3][4] The storm slowly drifted to the west and kept on intensifying gradually. On September 29, microwave imagery showed Nalgae developed an eyelike feature and well defined convective banding in all the quadrants. The system had a tiny radius of winds, though it was still strengthening significantly and was very well defined.[5] On the evening of September 28, the JMA reported that Nalgae continued to intensify, as they upgraded it to a severe tropical storm with winds of over 55 knots (102\u00a0km/h; 63\u00a0mph).[6] On that night, the PAGASA initiated advisories on Nalgae, giving it the local name Quiel, as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).[7] On the morning of September 29, the JTWC reported that Nalgae developed a small microwave eye like feature and multiple convective bands wrapped tightly into the center. Using the Dvorak technique, the JTWC estimated the average 1-minute sustained wind speed of Nalgae to be at 65 knots (120\u00a0km/h; 75\u00a0mph).[8] On that evening, the JMA further upgraded Nalgae to a typhoon.[9] Nalgae continued to drift westwards at approximately 13 knots (24\u00a0km/h; 15\u00a0mph) and continued to intensify. On the night of September 29, Nalgae's outflow to the east got more enhanced and the outflow in all other directions remained radial. Nalgae was running west quite quickly because of a strong and a deep subtropical ridge located to the east of the system. The JTWC anticipated Nalgae to continually strengthen before it made landfall over Luzon, Philippines.[10]  Continuing on its quick westward run, Nalgae developed a tiny 5 nautical miles (9.3\u00a0km; 5.8\u00a0mi) eye with a small break in the eyewall around the eastern periphery, because of a slight vertical wind shear as estimated by the JTWC. There was deep convective banding extending approximately 120 nautical miles (220\u00a0km; 140\u00a0mi) from the center and the overall outflow remained good. based on Dvorak intensity estimates, the winds of Nalgae were then raised to 95 knots (176\u00a0km/h; 109\u00a0mph).[11]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "Nalgae, the second typhoon hit Philippines within one week made landfall along the coast of Dinapigue town in Isabela province.  The PAGASA weather bureau chief Graciano Yumul said that \"The ground is still supersaturated and it cannot absorb more water. This will just flow down to rivers and towns, and there is a big possibility that landslides, flash flooding and flooding could occur.\" The search and rescue operations for Typhoon Nesat were halted because of the fierce weather brought by Nalgae. The NOLCOM chief Major General Jessie Dellosa said \"Our rescue operations are ongoing with the use of watercraft and rubber boats. We are also continuously coordinating with the local government units to rescue the affected residents in Calumpit and Hagonoy.\"[18] The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council director Benito Ramos said that thousands of rescue workers were deployed across Luzon and the island's sparsely populated northeast coast was evacuated following the orders from the president Benigno Aquino III. Ramous said \"We're implementing persuasive evacuation operations. If I have to handcuff people to remove them from their homes I could be charged with human rights violations.\"[19] Nalgae was making a similar path across the saturated Luzon Island as Typhoon Nesat. The wind gusts brought by Nalgae toppled trees and blew away tin roofs of some houses in Isabela's provincial capital of Ilagan. Nalgae continued to worsen the flooding and destruction brought by Nesat. Nalgae was far more stronger than Nesat and plummeted the nation with more winds and rains.[20] The governor of Isabela province, Faustino Dy said that \"Hundreds of people in coastal areas had been evacuated as rain and strong cut power lines, uprooted trees and blocked roads with debris.\" He added that \"Nalgae could cause floods on Luzon's central plains before passing through La Union province, a tobacco-growing area, and then heading off into the South China Sea.\" Also, the PAGASA announced that an estimated 10\u201318\u00a0mm per hour of rains were experienced in several areas across the nation filling up dams and causing river systems to swell.[21] As the storm continued to move inland with strong winds, many structures including billboards, tarpaulins and wooden materials in the town of Cauayan were damaged. The barriers of the Isabela highway were also destroyed by the typhoon. The government responded quickly and cleared off all the debris on the highway and made it usable again.[22] According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDDRMC), the onslaught of the typhoon resulted in the death of 1 person living in the Mountain Province, a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. It was reported that Sonny Marcos, a passenger on board a passenger van was buried alongside the Halsema Highway, the highest altitude highway in the Philippines that stretches from Baguio to Bontoc, Mountain Province.[23] [24][25] Nalgae only took about six hours to blow through the Luzon island. Office of Civil Defense administrator Benito Ramos told \"We are asking everyone still refusing to leave their homes to let authorities evacuate them.[26] The extremely strong winds blown by Nalgae set off a rockslide in northern Bontoc provincecausing boulders to roll down a mountainside and smash on a passing van, killing one man. In the rice-growing province of Bulacan north of Manila, several hundreds of people in several towns remained trapped on their rooftops as the floodwaters brought by Nesat never retreated and more flooding and rain was brought by Nalgae. Rescuers aboard rubber boats could not reach them because the alleyways were too narrow. Officials said that two army helicopters would be later deployed to rescue the victims.[27] The province of Pampanga was badly affected - mainly due to the already prevailing floods from the previous typhoon Typhoon Nesat (Pedring). The floods continued till 5 October - much after the rains subsided. Boats were brought out to navigate the roads that had turned into rivers. The ground floor of most houses remained under water up to 4 days after Quiel passed.",
      "Highest Public Storm Warning Signal[edit]": "",
      "China[edit]": "On October 3, the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center of China upgraded the rainstorm alert for Typhoon Nalgae to the orange level, the second-highest alert level in the country's four-level rainstorm alert system, reporting that a number of tidal stations off the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian would experience tides beyond the ordinary safety levels. The agency asked all the tourists heading to typhoon-hit provinces to remain flexible with their itineraries as several air and ship may be either cancelled or indefinitely delayed when the typhoon comes ashore.[16][17][clarification needed]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Rescue efforts[edit]": "The Rescue workers scrambled through the floodwaters on October 2, so that they could be able to deliver food, water and other relief materials to hundreds of villagers stuck on rooftops since several days after the twin typhoons ravaged the nation. Seven towns north of Manila including Calumpit in rice-growing Bulacan province continued to be under waist-high waters after the rains brought by Nalgae, the 17th tropical cyclone to affect the disaster-prone nation in 2011. Helicopters were able to deliver food via air, but could rescue none of those who were on the rooftops since 4 days.[28] The main problem with the evacuations was such that most of the victims refused to leave. The residents could do nothing but wade through the floodwaters, only to find the town hall completely submerged in water.[29] AirAsia, a Malaysian-based low-cost airline said that they would provide free aid to the victims of the twin typhoons in the Philippines. They announced that they would allocate special space in their cargo on its daily Manila bound flight. They also asked people who were interested to donate for the Filipinos could contact them at their email address, airasiacares@airasia.com.[30][31] On October 3, Philippine authorities rushed aid to thousands of people marooned in their flooded homes for a week since Nesat and Nalgae together battered the nation. After a long time, the flood water slowly started receding and the rescue workers were able to deliver food and other relief materials to those in need. In Calumpit. one of the worst hit towns, a construction worker in line for receiving the relief materials said to a new agency, \"We have no food to eat, and no clean drinking water.\"[32] Although floodwaters have begun to subside, thousands of families continued to stay in the evacuation centers as more than 43,000 houses were damaged by the typhoon Nesat alone. In the Pampanga province the typhoon breached several dikes or small channels developed for the flow of drain water. The destructive landslides brought by Nalgae cut off large portions of the Philippine highways isolating the town of Carranglan in Nueva Ecija.[33] Also, after the water receded, most of the victims refused to leave their homes and head for the evacuation centers as they feared that their houses could be easily robbed in such a situation. They asked for food and relief materials to be delivered to their house instead.[34] It was later reported that at least 8 million people living in the Philippines have experience faced much worse floods than the earlier destruction caused by typhoon Nesat. The disaster management chief Benito Ramos said \"The fight is not over yet. I hope the (Nesat) floods will wash out to Manila Bay before the (Nalgae) runoff hits the area. If the latter catches up to the former, there won\u2019t be any rooftops left to see above the floodwaters.\" The local weather agency announced that the water levels on the tributaries of major central Luzon rivers were still continuing to rise fast and posed a threat to the nearby towns and villages.[35]",

Situated within favorable conditions, the system quickly reached tropical storm intensity before strengthening further to typhoon status a day after formation. Intensification continued until Billie reached its peak intensity on July\u00a014 east of Taiwan with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[nb 1] Slight weakening occurred before the typhoon made landfall on Zhejiang in China on July\u00a016. After tracking inland, Billie curved northward and moved over the Yellow Sea before making a final landfall on North Korea on July\u00a017; the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards before dissipating over the Sea of Japan a day later. The rainbands of Billie brought severe flooding to the Philippines and Japan even while the typhoon's center was well removed from those locations. In the Philippines, one person was killed, and the flood damage totaled US$500,000.[nb 2] Floods were particularly destructive in Japan, where they destroyed 603\u00a0homes in the western portion of the country. Swaths of crops were inundated by the floodwaters, and 44\u00a0people were killed. Extensive flooding occurred in Taiwan and China, and seven deaths occurred in the former. In Busan, South Korea, Billie's effects forced the evacuation of thousands of people through tight corridors from a stadium, causing the indirect deaths of 61\u00a0people.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Beginning on July\u00a09, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) began dispatching aircraft reconnaissance to investigate an area of thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone.[1] Tracking westward,[2] there were few signs of organization or intensification until July\u00a012, when recon found a closed atmospheric circulation within the disturbance, signifying that a tropical depression had developed; JTWC bulletins and warnings commenced accordingly. Upon development, observations indicated that the system was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.[1] At 1200\u00a0UTC on July\u00a013, the JTWC upgraded Billie further to typhoon status,[2] making Billie the first tropical cyclone to be monitored by the JTWC since its inception earlier in 1959.[3] Now tracking steadily towards the northwest,[1] the typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200\u00a0UTC the next day with maximum sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph) according to the JTWC and a minimum barometric pressure assessed by the Japan Meteorological Agency\u00a0(JMA) at 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[2] By this time Billie's eye had shrunk to a size roughly 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) in diameter. At 0900\u00a0UTC on July\u00a015, Billie passed just 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) north of Taiwan; fifteen hours later the typhoon made landfall north of Fuzhou, China in Zhejiang with winds estimated at 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[1][2][4] Upon tracking inland on July\u00a016, interaction with China's mountainous terrain disrupted the organization of Billie, weakening it down to tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July\u00a017.[1] Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast of North Korea with winds of 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph).[1][2] Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from a polar front, enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[1] These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before they were last noted just off of Hokkaido on July\u00a018.[2][5]",
      "Impact[edit]": "As Billie tracked to the east of the Philippines, the outer rainbands of the tropical cyclone produced heavy rainfall to the archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, and the main islands of Japan. In the Philippines, the rains triggered floods that led to the death of one person and US$500,000\u00a0in damage.[6] About 100\u00a0people were displaced on the islands due to the rainfall.[7] The Japanese freighter Bansei Maru was grounded on a reef off of Ishigaki Island due to the rough surf and winds caused by the passing typhoon, necessitating a rescue operation by three United States Navy ships.[6] On the island, 16\u00a0homes were destroyed and 49\u00a0were heavily damaged. Inundation of crops was prevalent.[1] Flooding from Billie was highly destructive in areas of Japan west of the Ch\u016bbu region, destroying 603\u00a0homes and inundating 77,288 others. Roughly 325\u00a0km2 (125\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of farmland was impacted by the rains. Across Japan, 44\u00a0people were killed and 77\u00a0were injured.[8] In northern Taiwan, Billie caused widespread flash flooding, displacing thousands of people and resulting in extensive damage.[9] Approximately one-third of Taipei was inundated by floodwaters, and hospital patients were forced to evacuate to Okinawa after a Military Assistance Advisory Group compound was impacted by the heavy rains.[6] Over 10,000\u00a0people were rendered homeless in Taipei alone after the city's shanty-type dwellings along with well-built residences were destroyed.[10][1] In total, the effects of Billie in Taiwan killed seven people. Extensive flooding also occurred in nearby eastern China, inundating rice fields. In order to avoid the storm, thousands of fishermen sought shelter in local harbors.[6] Cleanup and relief operations quickly ensued following the storm's passage.[11] Storms accompanying Billie and its remnants brought heavy rains and strong winds to South Korea, knocking out police telephone lines in Busan. The sudden onslaught of these storms caused a stampede of roughly 70,000\u00a0people out of a stadium,[12][13] resulting in the indirect deaths of 68\u00a0people, including 51\u00a0children. Around 125\u00a0people were injured and 40\u00a0were hospitalized after the mass evacuation.[12][14]",

    "Whole_Text": {
      "Contents": "",
      "Hurricane Edouard (1996)": "Hurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season, reaching winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) on its path. Edouard remained a major hurricane for eight days, an unusually long amount of time. A Cape Verde hurricane, the storm formed near the coast of Africa in the middle of August. It moved westward then curved northward, and persisted until early September when it became extratropical to the southeast of New England. Edouard was originally forecast to strike the northeast United States, but it produced hurricane-force gusts to portions of southeastern Massachusetts while remaining offshore. The winds caused minor damage totaling $20\u00a0million. In addition, the hurricane generated strong waves and rip currents to coastlines, killing two people in Ocean City, New Jersey and causing numerous injuries.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection around an area of low pressure. A large circulation quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late on August 19 while located 345\u00a0mi (555\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one forecast for the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status on August 22.[1] After becoming a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened due to the establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) Category\u00a04 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250\u00a0mi (400\u00a0km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category\u00a04 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.[1] Late on August 29, Hurricane Edouard developed three concentric eyewalls, an unusual occurrence coinciding with an increase in strength to 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h). A mid-tropospheric trough turned the hurricane to the north to an area of unfavorable conditions, and Edouard weakened to a Category\u00a03 hurricanes on August 31. On September 1, the hurricane passed about midway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, and turned to the north-northeast. Edouard continued to weaken as it turned to the northeast, and on September 2 passed about 95\u00a0mi (153\u00a0km) to the southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts as an 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) hurricane, its closest point of approach to the United States. Edouard weakened to tropical storm status on September 3, and became extratropical shortly thereafter while located to the south of Nova Scotia. As an extratropical storm, Edouard turned to the east, then moved around the periphery of a larger extratropical storm until becoming absorbed by the storm early on September 7.[1]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "A high pressure system over New England resulted in the possibility that Edouard would track to the west and strike the United States.[2] One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred.[3] Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North Carolina to Watch Hill, Rhode Island and from the mouth of the Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm warning area.[1] In North Carolina, Cape Lookout was closed and evacuated prior to the storm's passage.[4]\nBecause a Hurricane Watch existed for the New York City metropolitan area, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials set up a hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas.[5] Near New Bedford, Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters in case of a direct hit.[6] New Bedford Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city.[7] However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage.[8] On Cape Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29\u00a0km) traffic backup.[9] As a result, many beach resorts lost millions in potential revenue. Of those who remained on Cape Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety.[10] Many sailors removed their boats from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of one every eight minutes.[8] In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed their boats, and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane.[9]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Despite initial predictions, Edouard's effects were much less than expected. Strong waves struck much of the East Coast of the United States, killing 2 and injuring numerous others. In 2011 the National Hurricane Center reported that Edouard had caused a total of US$20\u00a0million with the greatest damage occurring on Cape Cod, where moderate wind gusts resulted in $4.6\u00a0million (2007\u00a0USD).[11]",
      "Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic[edit]": "In South Carolina, minor beach erosion was reported in Charleston and Colleton Counties.[12] Swells of up to 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m), in combination with strong waves, caused overwash on Route 12 on Hatteras Island. Minor beach erosion occurred.[13] Moderate winds of up to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) blew down a few trees and caused shingle damage to buildings.[4] In Delaware, rough surf closed numerous coastal beaches, while storm tides and waves flooded a campground near the Indian River in Sussex County.[14] Strong waves in New Jersey killed two people and seriously injured another. Lifeguards made numerous rescues along the coast, while other beaches were closed or had restrictions on bathing. Winds were minor along the Jersey coastline, peaking at less than 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h).[15] In New York, Edouard produced strong waves and storm tides of one to two\u00a0ft (0.3 to 0.6\u00a0m), causing overwash along southern Long Island due to high tide. Coastal flooding occurred, including in Hampton Bays where the waves flooded one road and covered another with sand. The flooding trapped six cars, while the strong waves forced several beaches to close.[16] Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status,[1] though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized off the coast of Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured. A Celebrity Cruises cruise ship, the MV Zenith suffered damage from 30 to 50\u00a0ft (nine to 15\u00a0m) waves, injuring several passengers and crew members. Rainfall was minimal, peaking at less than a half of an inch in eastern Long Island.[16]",
      "New England and Canada[edit]": "Hurricane Edouard passed about 95 miles (153\u00a0km)/h) southeast of Nantucket while moving at only 12\u00a0mph (19\u00a0km/h), much slower than previous New England hurricanes. This resulted in several hours of strong waves, winds, and rain. The hurricane produced wave heights of up to 31 feet (9.4\u00a0m), which washed twelve boats ashore and damaged numerous others.[17] The strong waves and a storm surge of up to 2.1 feet (0.64\u00a0m) in Nantucket[1] flooded a few coastal roads.[17] Edouard also produced tropical storm force winds across much of Massachusetts, as well as one hurricane-force gust on Nantucket. In addition, there were unofficial reports of stronger gusts, including 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h) on Cape Cod, 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) on Nantucket.[1] The strong winds caused power outages to 2/3 of Nantucket, all of Martha's Vineyard for six hours, and most of Cape Cod for several hours.[17] Power outages, effecting 35,000 to 40,000[10] were reported throughout Massachusetts, though far from the power outages caused by Hurricane Bob five years prior.[8] The winds also downed numerous trees, and blew off the roof of the fire station in Hyannis. Rainfall was moderate from the slow-moving hurricane, peaking at 6.37 inches (162\u00a0mm) in West Dennis with many other locations reporting over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm). The rainfall produced minor street flooding.[17] Damage on Cape Cod totaled to $3.5\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD, $4.6\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD).[9] In New Hampshire, the hurricane produced winds gusts of up to 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) and around 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of rain along the coast.[18] In Maine, heavy surf closed several beaches[9] and injured two people. Waves also damaged several boats. Winds were moderate near the coast, peaking at 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) at Mount Desert Island. The winds knocked over several trees[19] and caused sporadic power outages throughout the state, including loss of power for 1,900 Portland residents.[9] In Kittery, water fell through an office building, damaging computer equipment.[19] Rainfall was minor, peaking at 1.23 inches (31\u00a0mm) in Eastport.[1] In southern Nova Scotia, Edouard produced heavy rainfall from 3.7 to 5.5 inches (94 to 140\u00a0mm). Winds were moderate, peaking at 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) in Cape Breton Highlands. The hurricane also caused beach erosion on southeastern Nova Scotia.[20]",

      "Late December 2012 North American storm complex": "Near the end of 2012, a massive storm complex developed that produced both a tornado outbreak and a blizzard across the southern and eastern United States. On Christmas Day 2012 (December 25), a tornado outbreak occurred across the Southern United States. This severe weather/tornado event affected the United States Gulf Coast and southern East Coast over a two-day span. It occurred in conjunction with a much larger winter storm event that brought blizzard conditions to much of the interior United States. In total, 31\u00a0tornadoes were confirmed by the National Weather Service in five states from Texas to North Carolina. All but one of the tornadoes that occurred during the outbreak touched down on December\u00a025, with the other occurring the following day in North Carolina. Two of the tornadoes were destructive enough to be rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. At least 16 people died as a result of the related blizzard, and thousands were without power. There were 63\u00a0preliminary local storm reports received for tornadoes, including 60 in four states on December\u00a025 alone.[4][5] Significant tornadoes included a long\u2013tracked EF3 that moved across areas of Mississippi and an EF2 that moved through Mobile, Alabama. The Mobile tornado damaged many homes, businesses, a hospital, and a high school, with estimated damages totaling $1.35 million.",
      "Meteorological synopsis[edit]": "On December 24, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a moderate risk of severe weather, valid for the following day, as conditions became favorable for severe weather. The moderate risk covered an area stretching from west-central Louisiana to west-central Alabama[6] and was expanded south and west on December\u00a025 to include cities such as Port Arthur, New Orleans, and Mobile.[7] From a meteorological standpoint, the outbreak was caused by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved southeast into Texas from the Rocky Mountains on the evening of December 24, becoming a powerful, negatively-tilted shortwave trough on December\u00a025.[8] In response to the shortwave trough, a surface low formed over south-central Texas by 1200 UTC that morning.[9] Warm, moist air near the surface flowed northward along a warm front extending east from the surface low along the gulf coast on the morning of December\u00a025.[10] Meanwhile, a cold front and dry line had formed to the southwest of the surface low and advanced eastward through the morning, providing a source of lift for convection to form in eastern Texas.[9] Initially, the convection congealed into a quasi-linear convective system while over northeast Texas and western Louisiana, with only a few tornadoes touching down in these areas.[11] Later in the afternoon, enough energy associated with the advancing shortwave trough allowed for the formation of discrete tornadic supercells ahead of the advancing squall line in Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southern Alabama, and around the same time, the SPC issued a Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) tornado watch for extreme eastern Louisiana, southern and central Mississippi, and western Alabama.[12] Southerly winds near the surface increased, providing strong low-level and deep layer wind shear needed for these cells, which would later produce tornadic activity.[13] By late-evening, most storms had congealed into a squall line and weakened due to waning instability.[14] In the early morning of December 25, a mix of rain and snow began to develop as the upper-level trough began to interact with low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.[15] The system intensified as it moved across the southern plains and into the Mississippi Valley on Christmas Day. The system was able to pull in cold arctic air, causing snow and freezing rain in the south, leading to a rare \"White Christmas\" event for that portion of the country.[16] As the system moved through the Tennessee Valley overnight into December 26, heavy snow continued in the Ohio Valley.[17] A number areas in the Ohio Valley region, including Dayton, Ohio and Miamisburg, Ohio, and other locations, like Arkansas, also experienced thundersnow.[18] As the day progressed, the system brought snow into the Great Lakes region, and a new low pressure center began to develop in North Carolina.[19] Environment Canada also reported that the system began impacting Ontario that day, bringing heavy snow to the province.[20] The system moved into the Northeast early December 27, with the upper-level trough moving just off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula.[21] At this point, the storm reached its lowest reported central pressure of 987\u00a0mb (29.15\u00a0inHg).[22] As the day progressed, the system began to weaken, with the pressure rising,[23] as it continued to move to the northeast, impacting New England, as the system tracked toward the Canadian Maritimes overnight into December 28.[24] That same day, Environment Canada reported heavy and blowing snow over Montreal, Quebec.[25] Early on December 28, the system moved through Nova Scotia, bringing heavy rain and snow before it moved out over the Atlantic Ocean.[26] During the next couple of days, the system slowly moved into the Atlantic Ocean, before accelerating eastward across the Atlantic on December 30. On December 31, the winter storm was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone, just northwest of the United Kingdom.[2]",
      "Confirmed tornadoes[edit]": "",
      "McNeill\u2013Maxie\u2013McLain, Mississippi[edit]": "This strong and long-tracked EF3 tornado touched down in Pearl River County, just southwest of McNeill where it downed several trees at EF0 to EF1 intensity along Harris Road. It then rapidly intensified to high-end EF2 strength as it impacted the western edge of McNeill, where many trees were snapped and multiple houses were heavily damaged or destroyed. A small house along Joe Smith Road was left with only a few walls standing, and an elderly woman was critically injured inside. A nearby brick house had its roof torn off. A strong velocity couplet and debris ball became visible on Doppler weather radar by this time. The tornado reached its peak strength of EF3 as it crossed Stones Chapel Road at the north edge of town, where it destroyed a single-story brick triplex, with only two interior walls left standing. A nearby house was heavily damaged at EF2 strength, and a few others sustained lesser damage in the area. One house in McNeill that was damaged beyond repair had survived effects from both Hurricane Camille and Hurricane Katrina. It then weakened back to EF2 strength as it crossed U.S. Route 11, snapping numerous trees and tearing the roofs off of some houses. The tornado weakened further and crossed Interstate 59, moving through unpopulated rural areas southeast of Poplarville, causing EF0 to EF1 tree and outbuilding damage. The tornado then struck a house at EF1 strength near the Stone County line, causing heavy roof damage. Eight people were injured in Pearl River County, 22 houses were destroyed or damaged beyond repair, eight had major damage, 16 had minor damage, and an additional nine were affected in some way.[65][66] The tornado strengthened to EF2 intensity again as it entered Stone County west of Texas, and caused significant damage to a few houses. Numerous pine trees were snapped at a campground in this area, and a mobile house and several more trees were downed before the tornado moved out of Stone County.[67] The tornado then moved into Forrest County and produced high-end EF2 damage as it passed near the small community of Maxie, where numerous trees and power lines were downed, two double-wide mobile homes were completely destroyed, a pickup truck was rolled, and a camper was thrown about 50 yards (46\u00a0m). Two additional double-wide mobile homes were severely damaged, a single-wide mobile home also sustained major damage, and a falling tree demolished a travel trailer. Four people were injured in Forrest County.[68] The tornado momentarily weakened to EF1 intensity as it crossed into Perry County and moved through portions of the DeSoto National Forest, downing many trees. A house sustained considerable roof and window damage, outbuildings were destroyed, and two cars were moved along this segment of the path. It quickly regained EF2 status as it crossed Mississippi Highway 29 and snapped several wooden electrical transmission poles. The tornado then destroyed a mobile home and a hunting camp before weakening back to EF1 status, damaging a few homes, and downing many more trees. The path length through Perry County was about 20 miles (32\u00a0km).[67] The tornado then crossed into Greene County and made a direct hit on the small town of McLain as an EF1, causing roof damage to an elementary school and a few houses. Damage to signs and the siding of a church also occurred. It also downed several trees before lifting as it exited McLain.[67] The tornado tracked for 60.4 miles (97.2\u00a0km) across five counties and injured 12 people.[68]",
      "Mobile\u2013Prichard, Alabama[edit]": "This large, wedge-shaped EF2 tornado was broadcast live on local television news tower cameras as it moved through Mobile. The tornado initially touched down at 2254\u00a0UTC (4:54\u00a0p.m. CST) in the northern part of the Mertz neighborhood of Mobile, just northwest of Interstate 10. The tornado initially produced EF0 damage in neighborhoods along Holcomb Avenue as it moved due north. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of snapped tree limbs, along with minor damage to a fence and a metal building. The tornado began to strengthen and grow in size as it approached and moved through the intersection of Government Street and the Dauphin Island Parkway. EF1 damage occurred in this area as multiple homes sustained roof damage and broken windows, trees and power lines were downed, and several businesses sustained considerable damage. One business sustained outward collapse of an exterior wall, and a brick structure sustained major damage to its second floor. The tornado then reached EF2 strength as it crossed Clearmont Street and struck Murphy High School, which sustained significant damage.[69] Damage at the high school included many broken windows, six portable classrooms being completely destroyed, the roofs being torn off of the auditorium and band building, and other large portions of roof being lifted off the building, only to be deposited back onto the structure. A metal-framed outbuilding was completely destroyed near the athletic field as well.[70] The tornado continued northward and inflicted EF2 damage to several homes and Trinity Episcopal Church.[69][71] At the church, part of a new slate roof was blown into the parking lot and a large portion of an exterior brick wall was knocked out, leaving a portion of the building visible from the outside. Homes in surrounding neighborhoods had their roofs torn off, large trees were snapped and uprooted, and gas leaks were reported in the area.[72] The tornado widened to its widest point of 200 yards (180\u00a0m) along this portion of the path.[69][73] The tornado continued to the north at EF2 intensity, ripping roofs off of homes as it crossed Springhill Avenue. By this point, a tornado emergency was declared for areas of Downtown Mobile at 2300\u00a0UTC (5:00\u00a0p.m. CST) as the large tornado approached those areas, stating Midtown Mobile, Downtown Mobile, and Prichard, Alabama as potentially affected areas. The tornado then weakened slightly to high-end EF1 strength, damaged several more homes, and blew out windows at Mobile Infirmary Medical Center, a hospital of more than 500 beds. Automobiles in the parking lot at the hospital were damaged, with one being flipped. It continued through the Allenville neighborhood, across Interstate 165 and into Prichard. Damage along this segment of the path ranged from mid-range to high-end EF1, as multiple small homes and apartment buildings were damaged, some of which sustained roof loss.[74] It also tossed several shipping containers and damaged a warehouse facility, before producing additional minor EF0 damage in the Plateau neighborhood of Prichard and then lifting. Many trees and power lines were downed along the path, which totaled 5.7 miles (9.2\u00a0km). Several people suffered minor injuries.[69] While only existing for eleven minutes,[74] damage estimates to the cities of Mobile and Prichard totaled out at $1.35 million.[75][76] The tornado followed a path just east of the weaker EF1 December 20 tornado, which also impacted Mobile.[77]",

      "Southeast and Midwest United States[edit]": "In Arkansas, two people were killed in a highway accident as a result of sleet on the roads. One person was killed when high winds knocked over a tree onto a house.[78] On December 25, more than 6 inches (15\u00a0cm) of snow fell in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.[79] Freezing rain was blamed for a 21-car pileup on Interstate 35 near Oklahoma City.[80] 40 Oklahoma National Guard soldiers were deployed throughout the state to assist motorists on roads.[81] Two people were killed in separate weather-related car crashes. The driver of a truck was killed in Texas when strong winds knocked over a tree, which fell on the vehicle.[78] Two people were killed in separate weather-related automobile accidents in Virginia.[82] The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for southern Illinois, the first blizzard warning in history for the region. Several counties also closed their courthouses due to the snow.[83] Two people were killed in a traffic accident in Indiana caused by snowy roads on December 26, including an 18-year-old Ohio girl that lost control of her vehicle due to poor road conditions and crashed into a snow plow.[82] Due to the snow, a game between the Indianapolis Pacers and Chicago Bulls was postponed until February 4, 2013.[84]",
      "Northeast United States and Canada[edit]": "A Southwest Airlines jet slid off its taxiway and got stuck in mud on the morning of December 27. There were no injuries on board, and the passengers and crew all took a later flight to their destination. A man was killed in a car accident while checking on a disabled vehicle along Interstate 78 near Allentown, Pennsylvania. On Wednesday evening, an American Airlines flight that had safely landed at Pittsburgh International Airport ran over a patch of snow on the tarmac and got stuck for approximately two hours. Nobody was injured in the incident.[82] Over 200 flights were cancelled at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Several pedestrian and car accidents were reported.[85] A record setting 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) of snow fell over the Montreal-Laval, Quebec area. The previous record snowfall occurred 41 years earlier in March 1971 when 42 centimetres (17\u00a0in) had fallen. Numerous road accidents were reported throughout the province, including a 15-vehicle pileup near Saint-Cuthbert, Quebec.[86]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "",
      "Louisiana[edit]": "In Alexandria, after a relatively short-lived EF2, utility/public works crews and police and fire personnel were dispatched around the city to aid in the cleanup. Within 12 hours of the tornado hitting, nearly 100% of the power had been restored and all streets were clear of hazardous debris.[87] In Tioga, after another EF2 tornado, neighbors, friends, and family of victims aided in the cleanup across town. Many homes and other structures were damaged and there were many volunteers ready to help victims of the tornado. Power was out in the area for at least two days.[88] A Cenla man partnered with the American Red Cross in an effort to raise at least $10,000 for storm victims across the area.[89]",
      "Mississippi[edit]": "Mississippi governor Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency for eight counties in the southern part of the state. These counties were: Pearl River, Forrest, Greene, Hinds, Jones, Lawrence, Wilkinson, and Stone.[66] Many donations were brought to the McNeill, Mississippi VFD building for victims of the EF3 tornado in Pearl River County. These donations came from citizens and businesses of many surrounding areas, such as Gulfport, Mississippi and Slidell, Louisiana. Items such as toiletries and yard supplies (shovels, rakes, etc.) were provided by the Sam's Club and Tractor Supply stores in Slidell. Many articles of clothing as well as many other supplies were donated as well.[90] In neighboring Stone County, many people pitched in to help with the cleanup in the affected areas. Stone County was affected by the same tornado that hit McNeill.[91]",
      "Alabama[edit]": "In Mobile and Prichard, volunteers distributed bottled water, yard supplies, and clean-up kits to people who were affected by the EF2 tornado in that area. Tarps were provided as well for houses that suffered roof damage. Murphy High School students were transferred to nearby Clark-Shaw Magnet School to finish out the school year as repairs were being made to Murphy High.[92] The Salvation Army provided food for more than 1,000 people in Mobile, as well as people affected by the EF2 tornado near Troy.[93] The Mobile Infirmary was damaged and, with no power, was relegated to using generators. Across the state, 27,600 Alabama Power customers were left without electricity, with approximately 23,000 of those in the Mobile area.[94] A local block party and concert took place at a school in Mobile on January 4, 2013. Everything for the party, including the food, a bounce house, and the music, was donated. All proceeds went to local Catholic Social Services and the American Red Cross to be distributed to Mobile families to help rebuild after the tornado.[95]",

      "Tropical Storm Doria": "Tropical Storm Doria was the costliest tropical cyclone in the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm of the season, Doria developed from a tropical wave on August 20 to the east of the Lesser Antilles, and after five days without development it attained tropical storm status to the east of Florida. Doria turned to the north, and reached peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) as it was making landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina. It turned to the northeast, and moved through the Mid-Atlantic and New England as a tropical storm before becoming an extratropical storm over Maine on August 29. In North Carolina, Doria produced moderate rainfall, resulting in localized flooding and damage. The storm spawned a tornado near Norfolk, Virginia, damaging twelve\u00a0houses and downing hundreds of trees. Tropical Storm Doria dropped heavy precipitation in New Jersey, peaking at 10.29 inches (261\u00a0mm) in Little Falls. The rainfall led to record-breaking river levels and flooding in several houses, resulting in damage to dozens of houses across the state. Moderate damage and rainfall continued along its path into New England and southeastern Canada. In all, Tropical Storm Doria caused seven deaths and $147.6\u00a0million (1971\u00a0USD, $1.11\u00a0billion 2024\u00a0USD).",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On August 15, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa,[1] and tracked westward while slowly organizing. On August 20, subsequent to the development of a low-level circulation, an area of convection along the wave developed into a tropical depression while located about 1,000 miles (1,600\u00a0km) east-northeast of Grenada. Initially failing to organize further, the depression moved to the west-northwest, and on August 23, it passed through the northern Lesser Antilles. The depression moved to the north of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas, and began to show further signs of organization on August 25. After briefly weakening on August 26, the depression re-strengthened while turning to the north, and attained tropical storm status on August 27 while located 230 miles (370\u00a0km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.[2] After reaching tropical storm status, Doria quickly intensified as its wind field expanded while moving northward. The minimum central pressure quickly dropped, as well, and late on August 27, Doria reached its peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) while making landfall on North Carolina near Morehead City. The storm maintained its peak winds as it moved north-northeastward through North Carolina, and weakened slightly to a 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) tropical storm after entering Virginia on August 28. Doria turned to the northeast, passing through the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva Peninsula before entering southern New Jersey. It paralleled the state a short distance inland, and after moving through New York City Doria became extratropical over northwestern Maine on August 29. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward until losing its identity near the border of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada.[2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Southeast United States and Virginia[edit]": "Doria passed near or through the northern Caribbean Islands and the Bahamas as a tropical depression, though effects, if any, are unknown. Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160 miles (260\u00a0km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75 inches (44\u00a0mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7 feet (1.7\u00a0m) above the mean low water level.[2] Upon making landfall in North Carolina, Doria produced a storm tide of 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) above normal at Cape Fear. Sustained winds in the state peaked at 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h) in Hatteras,[2] while gusts reached 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) in Atlantic Beach. In most areas, wind damage was minimal. Tropical Storm Doria dropped moderate rainfall across the state, including a report of 4.17 inches (106\u00a0mm) in Cape Hatteras.[3] Over 5 inches (130\u00a0mm) of rain fell around the Albemarle Sound and near New Bern.[4] The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides, which blocked roads and highways.[3] In localized areas, the flooding caused severe damage to roads and houses.[5] Flooding from Doria also damaged water and sewage systems.[3] Rainfall in the state persisted for two\u00a0weeks after the passage of Doria.[6] In Virginia, the storm produced a storm tide of 3.6 feet (1.1\u00a0m) above normal in Norfolk.[2] Sustained winds peaked at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in Langley Air Force Base,[7] while gusts reached 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h) in Norfolk.[2] The bands of the storm spawned an F1 tornado near Portsmouth and Chesapeake, damaging twelve homes and downing hundreds of trees. Damage from the tornado amounted to $250,000 (1971\u00a0USD$, 1.88\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[7][8] Rainfall from Doria was moderate, peaking at 6.44 inches (164\u00a0mm) at a location 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) south-southeast of Halifax. One person drowned in Alexandria when she fell into a draining ditch. The storm severely damaged a large warehouse in Norfolk, as well.[7] Damage in Virginia totaled $375,000 (1971\u00a0USD$, 2.82\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD).[9] Floodwaters from Doria clogged sewage systems near Norfolk, Virginia with sand and silt. This forced the sewage to be dumped into the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in the closure of several beaches for days.[7]",
      "Mid-Atlantic states[edit]": "Tropical Storm Doria dropped 3.85 inches (98\u00a0mm) of rain in Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C. In Maryland, the storm resulted in tides 2.7 feet (0.82\u00a0m) above normal in Fort McHenry. Rainfall in the state peaked at 4.39 inches (112\u00a0mm) in Baltimore, while wind gusts reached a maximum of 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) at the United States Coast Guard station in Ocean City. The storm produced 5.09 inches (129\u00a0mm) of rain in Wilmington, Delaware and a storm tide of 3.2 feet (0.98\u00a0m) above normal in Lewes. In Pennsylvania, the passage of Tropical Storm Doria resulted in 6.57 inches (167\u00a0mm) of rain and peak wind gusts of 73\u00a0mph (117\u00a0km/h) in Philadelphia.[2] Moderate winds downed trees and power lines in Pennsylvania,[10] and one person died in the state.[2] Several rivers in the southeastern portion of the state experienced record-breaking flooding.[6] In New Jersey, Doria produced wind gusts of up to 54\u00a0mph (87\u00a0km/h) and storm tides 5.3 feet (1.6\u00a0m) above normal in Atlantic City.[2] The outer bands of the storm spawned an F2 tornado near Cape May. It moved quickly northward through Cape May County, and caused about $250,000 in damage (1971\u00a0USD$, 1.88\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD) in damage along its 29-mile (47\u00a0km) path.[11] The storm dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 10.29 inches (261\u00a0mm) in Little Falls.[12] Record 24-hour rainfall totals occurred in Newark with 7.84 inches (199\u00a0mm) and Trenton with 7.55 inches (192\u00a0mm).[13] The rainfall led to record flooding on several small streams in the state.[6] The Beden Brook crested at over 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) above normal, which destroyed a bridge near Princeton.[10] The Raritan River at Manville crested at 9.8 feet (3.0\u00a0m), a record that stood until the passage of Hurricane Floyd in 1999.[14] The heavy rainfall overtopped the levee system in Zarephath,[15] causing severe damage to the Alma White College and preventing it from opening in the fall of 1971.[16] The rainfall also flooded two fire houses in Somerville with several feet of water,[17] and the water treatment plant in Bridgewater Township with 18 inches (460\u00a0mm) of floodwaters in what was catalogued as a 50-year flood event.[18] Following the flooding to the water treatment plant, officials raised the beams of the plant to withstand a 500-year flood event.[18] Eleven houses experienced flooding damage in Montgomery Township.[19] Doria killed three people[2] and caused $138\u00a0million in damage (1971\u00a0USD) in the state.[10]",
      "Northeast United States and Canada[edit]": "Tropical Storm Doria produced moderate winds in New York City with gusts to 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h). The storm tide reached 3.8 feet (1.2\u00a0m) above normal at Battery Park, and rainfall peaked at 5.96 inches (151\u00a0mm). LaGuardia Airport recorded 2.29 inches (58\u00a0mm) of rain in a one-hour period.[2] The threat of the storm cancelled a baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets.[20] Heavy rainfall flooded streets and subways in New York.[10] In Connecticut, Doria produced up to 3.12 inches (79\u00a0mm) of rain and wind gusts peaking at 48\u00a0mph (77\u00a0km/h) in Hartford. Doria dropped light rain in Rhode Island, including a report of 0.97 inches (25\u00a0mm) in Providence. The storm also produced wind gusts of up to 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h) and a storm tide of 5.9 feet (1.8\u00a0m) above mean water level. In Boston, rainfall totaled to 0.83 inches (21\u00a0mm),[2] while wind gusts peaked at 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at the Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory.[21] Two people drowned in Marblehead when they were swept away by surf from the storm.[22] The storm dropped moderate rainfall in Vermont, including a total of 5.73 inches (146\u00a0mm) in Mays Mill.[23] The rainfall caused road washouts, landslides, and damage to bridges in the southeast portion of the state.[24] The center of Tropical Storm Doria passed over south-central New Hampshire, resulting in heavy rains and damaging winds.[25] Sustained winds in Maine were generally around 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h), while gusts peaked at 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h) in Lewiston. The strong winds resulted in downed trees and widespread outages to power and telephone service. The winds also damaged a mobile home in Sabattus and a steel shed in Lewiston. Doria produced moderate rainfall, including a total of 1.75 inches (44\u00a0mm) in Lewiston, though little flooding occurred.[22] Moisture from Tropical Storm Doria entered southeastern Canada, peaking at over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) in the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region of Quebec.[4] The rainfall led to severe flooding in Victoriaville, causing damage to roads, bridges, and crops. Damage totalled to about $250,000 (1971 CND, $245,000 1971\u00a0USD).[26] Throughout its path, Tropical Storm Doria caused seven deaths and $147.6\u00a0million in damage (1971\u00a0USD). In early September 1971, President Richard Nixon declared counties in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania as disaster areas due to heavy rains and flooding. This allowed citizens in disaster areas to apply for federal assistance.[27][28][29]",

      "Typhoon Man-yi (2013)": "Typhoon Man-yi was a very severe storm that brought very strong winds and flash floods to Japan during mid-September. The third typhoon of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Man-yi was identified on September\u00a010. It became a storm on September 12 and reached peak intensity on September 15. Japan was then experiencing winds above 30 knots. Typhoon Man-yi became extratropical on September 16 and fully dissipated late on September 20 in the Kamchatka Peninsula region, bringing strong winds until September 25.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A large disturbance formed near the Northern Mariana Islands late on September 9. Late on September 11, the JMA reported that the disturbance intensified to a tropical depression had developed about 565\u00a0km (350\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands.[1] It was designated as 16W by the JTWC and JMA upgraded to a tropical storm naming it Man-yi on September 13, moving north then west on September 13. Man-yi still started intensifying and grew larger more later that day as it dropped a pressure of 20 millibars.[2] Late on September 14, Man-yi became a severe tropical storm, absorbing few dry air and making a small unbalanced eye. Man-yi started moving towards Japan making more strong winds to Japan on September 15 and made landfall on September 16 near Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture.[3]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "During September 14, as winds started to get stronger, evacuations were ordered to many places. In Kyoto, 268,000 residences were ordered to leave and about 81,000 in Fukuchiyama.[4] In Kyoto on September 16, 260,000 people in the city were ordered to evacuate to shelters. Hundreds of thousands of others were also ordered to evacuate across mainly the west side of Japan. The JMA issued a \u201cspecial warning\u201d for three western Japan prefectures of Fukui, Kyoto, and Shiga. Over 70 people were injured and at least one person was killed. The government of Japan set up emergency task forces and employed rescue teams. Many homes were flooded and about 80,000 were without electricity in western and central Japan. Trains in Tokyo and its vicinity were mostly suspended and hundreds of flights were grounded.[5] The storm made its first landfall in Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture in 08:00am on September 15 as 2 people were reported dead and 6 missing. During the morning hours of September 16, another 4 people were dead by falling trees, landslides and flashfloods. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, precipitation in the 48 hours through Monday morning reached about 300\u00a0mm in parts of the cities of Kyoto and Otsu \u2014 more than they usually get for the entire month. Precipitation topped 500\u00a0mm in parts of Mie and Nara, the agency said. In Osaka, about 290,000 residents in the city's harbor area were forced to flee early Monday. Although the evacuation order was lifted that afternoon, officials warned that the raging river currents were still dangerous. Severe thunderstorms associated with the typhoon resulted in a localized tornado outbreak with nine tornadoes touching down; none of these exceeded F1 intensity.[6] As of 09:00 pm on September 17, Typhoon Man-yi had weakened to an extratropical cyclone off Hokkaido, where up to 150\u00a0mm of rain was projected to have fallen by late Tuesday afternoon, the agency said. Damage across Japan were huge, total loss reached \u00a5160 billion (US$1.62 billion).[7]",

      "Great Flood of 1771": " The Great Flood of 1771 affected several rivers, including the Tyne, Tees, Wear and Eden and settlements across Northern England from 16 and 17 November 1771.[1] Its cause was a sudden thaw of the ice in upper Teesdale, a cloud burst over the Pennines and a continuous period of rain.[2] On the River Tyne at Newcastle upon Tyne the middle arch and two of the arches near the Gateshead side collapsed in the early hours of November 17.[3][4] Like many bridges of the time there had been houses and shops on the bridge.[3][1]  Upstream, most of the village of Styford on the north bank was destroyed.[1]  In total, 25 people died and thirteen or fourteen bridges, including Hexham Bridge, were destroyed on the North, South and main Tyne rivers.[5] On the River Wear in the city of Durham three arches of Elvet Bridge were destroyed,[1] and Prebends Bridge of 1574 was swept away.[6][7] Further downstream the city's Corn Mill was badly damaged and needed to be rebuilt.[8] On the River Tees mills and houses were lost, and the river was reportedly 0.5 miles (0.8\u00a0km) wide at Low Coniscliffe.[1] Yarm was one of the areas worst affected, as the river burst its banks in several places.  Some stretches of the High Street were submerged in 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) of water.[2]  According to reports, the whole of Yarm lay underwater, every building was affected, six houses were destroyed and many more left uninhabitable.[9] The Shambles was washed away and the town's main church was also damaged. Nine of the townspeople also died.[2] To the west, the River Eden also rose and affected Carlisle and Botcherby Mill, flooding the church.[10] as did Solway Moss, flooding local farms and settlements.[11]",

      "Tropical Depression One (1988)": " Tropical Depression One was the wettest tropical cyclone in Cuba since Hurricane Flora of 1963. The first tropical cyclone of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, the system developed on May\u00a030 from an area of disturbed weather in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The tropical depression headed northeastward, making landfall in La Habana Province, Cuba, without intensifying. Crossing Cuba, the depression became very disorganized as it emerged into the Straits of Florida and degenerated into an open trough on June\u00a02. Although only a tropical depression, the system flooded central and western Cuba with over 40\u00a0inches (1000\u00a0mm) of rain, causing 37\u00a0fatalities, damage to over 1,000 houses, and the evacuation of about 65,000\u00a0residents.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On May\u00a031, Tropical Depression One developed in the western Caribbean Sea,[1] a day before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.[2] The depression moved northeastward, passing just northwest of Isla de la Juventud before striking the Cuban mainland south of Havana. As it crossed the country, its strongest rainfall was east of the center, and the depression failed to intensify beyond winds of 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h).[1][3] The National Hurricane Center never expected it to strengthen further, due to unfavorable wind shear.[4] After a hurricane hunters flight could not detect a circulation,[5] The depression degenerated into an open trough east of Florida on June\u00a02.[1][3]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "While crossing Cuba, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, affecting the provinces of Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Sp\u00edritus, Camag\u00fcey, and Ciego de \u00c1vila. The precipitation peaked at 40.35\u00a0in (1,025\u00a0mm) in Cienfuegos Province, of which 34.13\u00a0in (867\u00a0mm) fell in one day. At the time, it was the second highest rainfall total in the country, only behind Hurricane Flora in 1963, although Hurricane Dennis in 2005 later surpassed the depression.[6] Rainfall reached 22.76\u00a0in (578\u00a0mm) in Cienfuegos and 21.90\u00a0in (556\u00a0mm) in Sancti Sp\u00edritus.[7] The heavy rainfall caused flooding in Camag\u00fcey that damaged about 5,700\u00a0houses and destroyed 200.[7][8] The flooding also damaged 15 schools and hospitals, as well as several crop buildings.[7] The floods left widespread areas without electricity or communications. Six bridges were destroyed in central and western Cuba, which, in addition to damaged roads and rail lines, severely disrupted the country's transportation infrastructure.[9] A total of 131\u00a0roads were unpassable due to the flooding, and 55\u00a0rail lines were damaged.[7] The flood waters prompted officials to evacuate 65,000\u00a0residents in low-lying areas,[9] including using helicopters and amphibious vehicles.[10] A tornado was reported in the city of Camag\u00fcey, destroying five Soviet planes and several buildings.[9] By the day after the depression dissipated, the Cuban government reported nine deaths,[10] although the death toll was later finalized at 37.[6] The depression also killed thousands of livestock.[7] Following the severe flooding, the Red Cross sent aid to the victims of Tropical Depression One in Cuba. The Red Cross had sent medical units, tents, blankets, and other necessary item to the victims by plane.[11] Overall about 90,000\u00a0people were affected.[7] With most of the rainfall occurring east of the center, the depression did not produce significant precipitation in Florida. Precipitation of around 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) spread across the Miami area, peaking at 3.18\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm) in Pompano Beach.[3]",

      "Hurricane Matthew": "  Effects Other wikis Hurricane Matthew was an extremely powerful Atlantic hurricane which caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in Haiti, as well as widespread devastation in the southeastern United States. The deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Stan in 2005, and the first Category\u00a05 Atlantic hurricane since Felix in 2007, Matthew was the thirteenth named storm, fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season. It caused extensive damage to landmasses in the Greater Antilles, and severe damage in several islands of the Bahamas which were still recovering from Joaquin, which had pounded the archipelago nearly a year earlier. Matthew also approached the southeastern United States, but stayed just offshore, paralleling the Florida coastline. Originating from a tropical wave that emerged off Africa on September\u00a022, Matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a028. It became a hurricane north of Venezuela and Colombia on September\u00a029, before undergoing explosive intensification, ultimately reaching Category\u00a05 intensity on October\u00a01 with peak 1-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0mph. This strength was attained at just 13.4\u00b0N latitude \u2013 the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the Atlantic basin, breaking the record set by Hurricane Ivan in 2004.[1] Matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a strong Category\u00a04 hurricane as it made its first landfall over Haiti's Tiburon Peninsula early on October\u00a04, and then a second one in Cuba later that day. Matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest, making landfall in the northern Bahamas. The storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern United States over the next 36 hours, gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge near McClellanville, South Carolina as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the morning of October\u00a08. Matthew re-emerged into the Atlantic shortly afterward, eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on October\u00a09. The remnants of Matthew continued to accelerate towards Canada where it was absorbed by a cold front.[2] Widespread effects were felt from Matthew across its destructive path, however, the most significant impacts were felt in Haiti, with US$2.8\u00a0billion in damage and 546\u00a0deaths, making Matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake. The combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land; around 80% of J\u00e9r\u00e9mie sustained significant damage. Four people were killed in Cuba due to a bridge collapse, and total losses in the country amounted to US$2.58\u00a0billion, most of which occurred in the Guant\u00e1namo Province. Passing through the Bahamas as a major hurricane, Matthew spread damage across several islands.  Grand Bahama was hit directly, where most homes sustained damage in the townships of Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock. Preparations began in earnest across the southeastern United States as Matthew approached, with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties; widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding, especially in the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area. In Florida, over 1\u00a0million lost power as the storm passed to the east, with 478,000\u00a0losing power in Georgia and South Carolina. While damage was primarily confined to the coast in Florida and Georgia, torrential rains spread inland in the Carolinas and Virginia, causing widespread flooding.",
      "Meteorological history": "A vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 22 and moved rapidly across the Atlantic, being monitored by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for possible tropical cyclogenesis. Despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a027, the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone, as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center. However, by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September 28, the wave developed a closed circulation while located near Barbados, hence becoming a tropical storm, and was assigned the name Matthew. Continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge, the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029. The effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day, and Matthew began a period of explosive intensification; during a 24-hour period beginning at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030, the cyclone's maximum winds more than doubled, from 80 to 165\u00a0mph (129 to 266\u00a0km/h), making Matthew a Category 5 hurricane,[1] the first since Felix in 2007;[3] the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the Atlantic since records began. Due to upwelling of cooler waters, Matthew weakened to a Category\u00a04 hurricane later on October\u00a01, before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) late on October\u00a02.[1] Slowly rounding the ridge, Matthew fluctuated in intensity within the Category\u00a04 range from October\u00a01\u20135. Intensification resumed again late on October 3 and culminated when Matthew made landfall near Les Anglais, Haiti, around 11:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a04 with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 934 millibars (27.6\u00a0inHg), making it the strongest to hit Haiti since Cleo in 1964. Continuing northward, the hurricane struck Mais\u00ed in Cuba early on October\u00a05 as a slightly weaker storm. Cuba's and Haiti's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category\u00a03 status, as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the Bahamas. Restrengthening occurred as Matthew's circulation became better organized, with the storm becoming a Category\u00a04 hurricane again while passing Freeport. However, Matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place. The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia, the western portion of the outer eyewall came ashore in Florida as a Category\u00a03 hurricane, while the inner eyewall remained just offshore. Matthew weakened to a Category\u00a02 hurricane late on October\u00a07 and then to a Category\u00a01 hurricane by 12:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08.[1] Around 15:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08, the hurricane made landfall at Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, near McClellanville, South Carolina, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h) and a central pressure of 963\u00a0mbar (28.4\u00a0inHg), which made it the strongest to strike the United States in terms of pressure since Irene in 2011, and the first hurricane to make landfall north of Florida in October since Hurricane Hazel in 1954.[nb 1][4][1] Convection became displaced from the center as Matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear, with the NHC declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on October\u00a09. The remnants persisted for another day, before they were absorbed by a cold front.[1]",
      "Records": "Matthew set several records during its long and destructive journey. Matthew intensified into a Category\u00a05 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4\u00a0degrees north, breaking the record set by Ivan in 2004, which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7\u00a0degrees north.[1] Matthew also maintained at least Category\u00a04 status for the longest duration on record for the month of October, according to Phil Klotzbach of Colorado State University, doing so for roughly 5 days.[5]",
      "Preparations": "",
      "Windward Islands and South America": "On September\u00a027, prior to Matthew becoming a tropical cyclone, LIAT began cancelling flights across the Windward Islands in anticipation of squally weather.[6] Schools and businesses were closed for the duration of Matthew's passage on September\u00a027 and 28 on Grenada,[7] St. Vincent and St. Lucia; schools in Dominica suspended classes until October\u00a03.[8][9] Hewanorra International Airport and George F. L. Charles Airport on St. Lucia were closed on September\u00a028.[9] Six shelters were opened across the island; 133\u00a0sought refuge in them.[10] Upon the formation of Matthew as a tropical cyclone on September\u00a028, governments across the Windward Islands issued tropical storm warnings in anticipation of gale-force winds.[11] The storm's unusual south track prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches on September\u00a028 for Aruba, Bonaire, Cura\u00e7ao, and the northern coast of Colombia from the Colombia\u2013Venezuela border to Riohacha.[12][13] North Atlantic hurricanes affecting South America are uncommon. The watch in Colombia was later upgraded to a warning on September\u00a030 as Matthew continued on a west-southwest track near the country.[14] Residents across the ABC Islands were advised to board their homes and stock up on supplies, leading to long lines at supermarkets and gas stations.[15] Cura\u00e7ao's government postponed the 2016 general election until October\u00a05.[16] Government offices in Aruba closed for September\u00a030.[15] A local sporting event, the Kingdom Tournament, was canceled in Aruba.[16] Schools across the Guajira Peninsula of Colombia suspended activities for September\u00a030.[17] Officials opened shelters and closed beaches across the peninsula.[18]",
      "Jamaica": "Jamaica suffered relatively minor effects, characteristic of tropical storm conditions. Along the coast, rip currents and beach erosion was reported, with additional flooding due to rainfall occurring. Strong wind gusts tore at the island's vegetation, causing minor damage.",
      "Haiti": "On October\u00a04, the United States prepared the aircraft carrier, the hospital ship USNS\u00a0Comfort\u2014which previously aided thousands in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake\u2014and the transport dock for relief operations in Haiti. USS\u00a0Mesa Verde and USS\u00a0George Washington were later relieved by USS\u00a0Iwo Jima, along with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. United States Southern Command also deployed 100\u00a0troops with 9\u00a0helicopters to the Cayman Islands to prepare for relief work.[156] Initial estimates indicated at least 350,000\u00a0people were in need of assistance.[92] The bridge between the south and Port-au-Prince was destroyed. As a result, aid agencies reported they were having difficulty getting around to the most damaged and storm-affected parts of Haiti.[157] The commander of U.S. forces in the Caribbean reported that troops and 6 helicopters from Joint Task Force-Bravo had been deployed to Haiti for the aftermath, and were expected to arrive on October\u00a06. These are expected to help with search-and-rescue missions as well as providing medical assistance. In addition to his, a one-star navy admiral will also travel to lead the task force involved in the operations. More than 300 military personnel will most likely travel to Haiti, with 300 Marines on board on the ships sent out for aid from the U.S.[158] A number of aid agencies deployed to Haiti to help with the aftermath:[159]",
      "Dominican Republic": "The EU Caribbean Investment Facility and a \u20ac50 million loan from the European Investment Bank will finance the reconstruction of housing, but also other essential infrastructure lost including roads, bridges and urban infrastructure. Climate resilience will be improve through infrastructure being built to higher standards and through flood prevention and better use of land. Around 1,000 new house will be built for between 4 000 and 5 000 people with priority given to more economically vulnerable people.[164][165]",
      "Cuba and the Bahamas": "The Meteorological Service of Cuba raised hurricane watches for all of southeastern Cuba on October\u00a01, encompassing the provinces of Camag\u00fcey, Las Tunas, Granma, Holgu\u00edn, Santiago de Cuba, and Guant\u00e1namo.[21] This was subsequently upgraded to a warning on October\u00a02 for all provinces except Camag\u00fcey.[31] Non-essential personnel in the United States' Guantanamo Bay Naval Base began evacuations that day.[32] Evacuations of more than 1\u00a0million people across Cuba started that morning, including 252,000 in Santiago de Cuba, and 230,000 from Las Tunas with priority placed on those along the coast.[45][46] Across Santiago de Cuba, which suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, 218\u00a0shelters were opened and officials placed extra attention on Socapa, Caracoles, and Cayo Granma.[45] Emergency personnel, primarily doctors, were dispatched to high-risk areas and supplies were stockpiled.[46] The Government of the Bahamas began issuing hurricane watches on October\u00a02 for southeastern islands as well as the Turks and Caicos.[31] Flights across southern islands were cancelled and schools suspended operations beginning the following day.[47]",
      "United States": "In Georgia, the Governor retracted previous evacuations later, emphasizing that their lives could not be endangered for those who chose not to leave. 1,000 members of the National Guard were deployed for help later.[166] In North Carolina, nearly 900 people had been rescued by boat crews by the morning of October\u00a09.[167] In April\u00a02017, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper requested $929\u00a0million in federal funds. The following month, the Trump administration denied more than 99\u00a0percent of this request and only provided $6.1\u00a0million to the state.[168]",
      "Online response": "On October\u00a06, the conservative news aggregator Drudge Report\u2014run by Matt Drudge\u2014headlined a five-word comment on Matthew: \"Storm Fizzle? Matthew Looks Ragged!\" which linked to a Miami Herald article.[68][69] Drudge later used Twitter to claim that the National Hurricane Center was lying to the public about the intensity of the storm, stating that measurements from Nassau, Bahamas, did not match the 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h) gusts listed in public advisories. The tweets implied that the hurricane was not as dangerous as it seemed and that politicians were trying to \"blame mankind,\"[70] referring to a blog posting about Hillary Clinton.[70] This came on the heels of radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh's claims of the conspiracy to \"sell\" climate change.[71] The claims of conspiracy were posted as Matthew posed a dire threat to Florida's east coast and when residents across the state were being urged to evacuate immediately.[72] Drudge's commentary was quickly met with sharp condemnation and criticism from meteorologists and public officials. Democratic Representative Keith Ellison called the comments \"irresponsible\" and urged people to \"not listen to this man.\"[70] Jason Samenow of The Washington Post described it as an \"incredible and offensive accusation\", and stated that it \"may have introduced enough doubt to lead [residents] into a decision they will regret.\"[68]",
      "Impact": "",
      "Windward Islands": "On St. Vincent, heavy rains caused landslides and flooding across the island. One person was killed in the town of Layou when a boulder broke loose.[8] In nearby Buccament Bay, a river overtopped its banks, prompting at least 25\u00a0people to evacuate to emergency shelters. The Hermitage River rose by at least 3.6\u00a0ft (1.1\u00a0m) in one hour, and as a precautionary measure, the Central Water and Sewage Authority shut off all water service. Flooding also took place in Vermont, South Rivers, sections of Kingstown, Campden Park, Arnos Vale, and Langley Park. Debris deposited by flooded rivers rendered many roads impassable.[9] Strong winds in excess of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) downed many trees and power lines on St. Lucia, leaving roughly 70\u00a0percent of the island without power. Landslides and flooding, the result of more than 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain accompanying the storm, damaged many homes and roads.[8] Rainfall at Hewanorra International Airport amounted to 13.19\u00a0in (335\u00a0mm).[81] The nation's banana crop suffered significant damage; 85\u00a0percent of farms reported losses. Two homes were destroyed, one in Bisee, and one in Gros Islet; several others were damaged. Roads in Castries, Gros-Islet, Dennery, and Soufriere became impassible from debris or landslides.[10] Some damage was also reported on Dominica, temporarily leaving many people without water and electricity.[8] Heavy rainfall in Grenada disrupted the water supply in multiple communities.[82] In Martinique strong winds, which gusted up to 89\u00a0mph (143\u00a0km/h) in Saint-Pierre,[81] wreaked havoc on the power grid; roughly 55,000\u00a0people lost electricity. Numerous trees downed by the winds blocked roadways while heavy rains led to flooding. The main road from Fort-de-France to southern towns was rendered impassable during the storm. Approximately 4,000\u00a0people lost their water supply. Three people sustained minor injuries.[83]",
      "ABC islands and South America": "The effects of Matthew across the ABC islands were relatively limited despite its proximity. Some street flooding occurred on Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao. Heavy winds were also experienced. There was some damage to cars after street flooding occurred. Outdoor bars and restaurants were damaged.[15] The Guajira Peninsula of Colombia saw its first heavy rain event in three years, leading to widespread flash flooding. One person drowned in a swollen river in Uribia;[18] 1.29\u00a0in (32.8\u00a0mm) of rain fell in 30\u00a0minutes in the town.[84] Rainfall in Cartagena reached 8.7\u00a0in (222\u00a0mm) during a 24-hour span and Santa Marta saw 5.5\u00a0in (140\u00a0mm).[85] Along coastal areas of the peninsula, large swells damaged buildings, prompting the evacuation of 380\u00a0people in Manaure.[17][18] Roughly 70\u00a0percent of Tucurinca flooded when the Magdalena River overtopped its banks; a nearby bridge collapsed, isolating some communities.[86] Approximately 73,000\u00a0people were affected by the floods.[85] The dangerous conditions produced by Matthew prevented thousands of people from voting in a peace agreement referendum.[87]",
      "Cuba": "The World Food Programme coordinated with the Government of Cuba to provide food to approximately 180,000\u00a0people in need across eastern provinces. The operation would span six months and cost US$4\u00a0million.[163]",
      "Bahamas": "Experiencing a direct hit from the eyewall of Matthew, Grand Bahama suffered extensive damage. An estimated 95\u00a0percent of homes in Eight Mile Rock and Holmes Rock sustained severe damage. Numerous trees and power lines were toppled by the storm's high winds, rendering roads impassable. Flooding-induced by the backside of the storm affected much of the western half of the island.[111] Total losses from Matthew in the Bahamas are estimated to be around $580\u00a0million.[73][112]",
      "Florida and Georgia": "As Hurricane Matthew traveled rapidly towards the southeastern region of the United States, it hit closely to the coasts of Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, and North Carolina. On October 7 in Fernandina Beach, Florida, there was a peak surge of 9.88\u00a0ft (3.01\u00a0m) above normal. Additionally, in the St. Augustine area, water was reported to be 2.5\u00a0ft (0.76\u00a0m) above ground.[123] As Matthew tracked parallel to the Florida coast, it left over one million people without power across the state of Florida.[124] In Jacksonville it caused major sand dune damage and flooding in the St. Johns River. It also destroyed many properties and knocked out power for nearly 250,000 electrical customers.[125] In Indialantic, Florida, firefighters exposed themselves to the storm's winds to put out a fire, which reportedly destroyed a greenhouse.[126] In Florida, one woman died due to a heart attack; she had called for aid, but medical services were not able to arrive due to Matthew's high winds. Another two women were killed by falling trees.[127][128] In the Flagler Beach area, a portion of Florida State Road A1A was washed away.[129] At Kennedy Space Center, winds reached 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at ground level while a gust of 136\u00a0mph (219\u00a0km/h) was observed atop a 500\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m) tower. The facility suffered several million dollars-worth of damage, though overall impacts were less than anticipated. The roof of Operations Support Building II broke, and rainwater damaged the interior. Air conditioning was lost throughout Launch Complex 39 as well.[130] The planned launches of GOES-R, NOAA's next generation weather satellite, and CYGNSS, a cluster of smaller satellites which study hurricanes, were delayed due to the suspension of operations during Matthew.[131][132][133] Over 250,000 customers were left without power in Georgia after Hurricane Matthew affected the area. Roads were also blocked in the Brunswick, Georgia, area, where all access points to St. Simons Island were rendered impassable.[134]",
      "North and South Carolina": "Across South Carolina, at least 600,000 individuals lost power, where significant flooding was reported to have occurred in Charleston after a seawall was breached.[135] Hilton Head Island experienced widespread water, sewer and power outages for several days, and the only road onto the island was not re-opened to residents until October 11. It is estimated that over 120,000 trees were downed on the island, causing extensive tree-strike damage to residences and businesses. Over 2.1 million cubic yards of vegetative debris generated by the storm was collected. The Waccamaw River crested in Conway at 17.9\u00a0ft (5.5\u00a0m), breaking a record set by the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. The Little Pee Dee River reached a record crest of 17.1\u00a0ft (5.2\u00a0m) at Galivant's Ferry, also breaking a 1928 record.[136] Twenty-six people died in storm-related incidents across North Carolina.[115] 680,000 in North Carolina were without power at one point.[138] Sections of Interstate 95 in South Carolina and in North Carolina had to be shut down as a result of hurricane flooding.[139] The North Carolina section reopened October 17.[140] After 10\u00a0in (25\u00a0cm) of rain fell in Cumberland, Harnett, Hoke, Moore and Robeson Counties on September 28 causing flooding, Matthew dumped another 10 to 14\u00a0in (25 to 36\u00a0cm).[141] As a result, the Lumber River reached a record 24\u00a0ft (7.3\u00a0m) in the south end of Lumberton, breaking the record of 20.5\u00a0ft (6.2\u00a0m) feet.[142] Robeson County schools did not reopen until October 31.[143] In Smithfield, the Neuse River crested at 29.09\u00a0ft (8.87\u00a0m), 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) higher than after Hurricane Fran.[144]  In Kinston, the Neuse crested at 28.31\u00a0ft (8.63\u00a0m), a foot (300\u00a0mm) higher than the record set by Hurricane Floyd.[145] In Greenville, the Tar River crested at 24.5\u00a0ft (7.5\u00a0m).[137] Preliminary estimates indicate that roughly 100,000\u00a0structures were flooded across the state and damage reached US$1.5\u00a0billion.[146]",
      "Virginia and the Northeast": "When the hurricane hit Virginia, Matthew caused two deaths. Heavy wind gusts of up to 68\u00a0mph and more than 11 inches of rain led to hundreds of downed trees and severe street flooding in southern Virginia Beach.[147][148][121] The Northeast received heavy rain and minor flooding throughout the days of October 9 and 10.[149] Game 2 of the 2016 National League Division Series between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers was postponed due to rain from the hurricane.[150]",
      "Canada": "Matthew's post-tropical remains were absorbed into a frontal zone off the coast of North Carolina. The humidity of the tropical system was drawn into the storm that was formed then. The latter gave heavy rain and strong winds in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland from October 10 to 11. In Nova Scotia, rain amounts were recorded from east to west as 8.85\u00a0in (224.8\u00a0mm) in Sydney (Cape Breton Island), 5.09\u00a0in (129.2\u00a0mm) in Port Hawkesbury, 4.50\u00a0in (114.4\u00a0mm) in Ch\u00e9ticamp, 4.05\u00a0in (102.8\u00a0mm) in Halifax, 3.263\u00a0in (82.88\u00a0mm) in Kentville, and 1.94\u00a0in (49.2\u00a0mm) in Yarmouth.[151] Heavy rains and strong winds caused flooding and dangerous conditions, particularly in the counties of Pictou, Antigonish, Guysborough and Cape Breton. Several roads were closed to heavy trucks, including Halifax Harbour bridges and the Confederation Bridge between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.[151] Newfoundland was even more affected with accumulations generally ranging from 3.9 to 5.9\u00a0in (100 to 150\u00a0mm) in the central, southern and western areas. Steady rain fell sometimes at a rate of 0.39 to 0.79\u00a0in (10 to 20\u00a0mm) per hour, and even 1.7\u00a0in (42\u00a0mm) per hour in Burgeo. A private station in that community recorded a total of 9.23\u00a0in (234.4\u00a0mm), while the official station of the Gander International Airport signaled 6.45\u00a0in (163.8\u00a0mm).[152][153] The rain caused numerous landslides and swollen rivers cut roads. The state of emergency was declared in Lewisporte, St. Alban's and Little Burnt Bay.[154] The town of St. Alban's, a community of about 1,200, was cut off from the surrounding communities when the main bridge in town was carried by the waters and a nearby community (Conne River) provided a boat to transport people to St. Alban's and out of the community.[154] The highway to Burgeo, on the south coast of Newfoundland, was also flooded and had to be closed.[152] The winds of over 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) also caused many fallen trees and electric power outages. The official maximum winds were recorded in Port aux Basques at 80\u00a0mph (128\u00a0km/h) and informally in Green Island, Fortune Bay, at 81\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[152] Insurance loss across Atlantic Canada were in excess of C$100\u00a0million (US$76\u00a0million).[74]",
      "Aftermath": "",
      "Lesser Antilles": "In Martinique, \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France requested additional crews from Guadeloupe and French Guiana to help restore power. Members of the military and Forces fran\u00e7aises aux Antilles were deployed to assist in clearing debris from roadways.[83] The St. Lucia Red Cross distributed non-food items to 270\u00a0people affected by the storm.[155]",
      "Retirement": "Because of the extensive damage and loss of life the storm caused in multiple countries along its track, the name Matthew was retired in March 2017 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used to name an Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Martin for the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season.[169][170]",

      "January 2013 Northwest Pacific cyclone": " The January 2013 Northwest Pacific cyclone was a powerful extratropical cyclone which caused heavy rainfall and a severe blizzard in Japan in January 2013. Forming northeast of Taiwan on January 13 and absorbing Tropical Depression Bising soon afterward, the storm quickly intensified in the southern sea off Japan on January 14, and reached its peak intensity east of Japan on January 15, with its central atmospheric pressure decreasing to 936\u00a0hPa (27.6\u00a0inHg).[3][4][5] The system then weakened, crossed the Kamchatka Peninsula late on January 18, and dissipated east of Hokkaido on January 21.[6][7]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "At 0000 UTC on January 13, an extratropical cyclone formed northeast of Taiwan, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to issue storm warnings on the developing low;[3] 18 hours later, the storm southeast of Kyushu absorbed Tropical Depression Bising which formed near the Philippines.[4][8] Fed by the remnants of the tropical depression's huge amounts of heat and vapor, the storm quickly intensified and became a hurricane-force bomb cyclone when it passed over the sea south of Japan on January 14. Late the same day, the estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds reached 80 knots (150\u00a0km/h) when the storm was east of the T\u014dhoku region.[9] On January 15, the atmospheric pressure of the powerful extratropical cyclone far east of Hokkaido decreased to 936\u00a0hPa (27.6\u00a0inHg), which is equivalent to a very strong typhoon.[5] At 0000 UTC on January 16, the extratropical cyclone started to weaken, and the storm was no longer producing sustained hurricane-force winds.[10] A half of day later, the estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds weakened to 50 knots (93\u00a0km/h) when the system was located southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, whilst the atmospheric pressure also decreased to 948\u00a0hPa (28.0\u00a0inHg).[11] The storm turned westerly on January 17, and it became gale-force at 00Z on January 18.[12] Late on January 18, the center crossed the southernmost point of the Kamchatka Peninsula and arrived at the Sea of Okhotsk, when the atmospheric pressure was 986\u00a0hPa (29.1\u00a0inHg).[6] The low turned southwesterly then southerly, and it passed through the Kuril Islands on January 20.[13] The system finally dissipated to the far east of Hokkaido on January 21.[7][14]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Japan[edit]": "The powerful extratropical cyclone which passed over the sea south of Japan caused heavy rainfall and snowfall in the country on January 14. In Tokyo, the blizzard dumped 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) of snow in nine hours. It also left 13\u00a0cm (5.1\u00a0in) of snow in the neighboring city Yokohama and 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) of snow in mountainous areas around Tokyo.[15] About 1600 injuries were recorded in Japan.[16] In Shiojiri, a 71-year-old man died after falling into an open drain as he cleared snow around his house.[15] A large chunk of frozen snow fell from the Tokyo Skytree and crashed into the roof of a house below, leaving a 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) hole.[16] As January 14 was also Coming of Age Day in 2013, many young Japanese people who were celebrating their 20th year had to walk through heavy snowfall to attend Coming of Age Day ceremonies.[17]",

      "Hurricane Rick (2021)": " Hurricane Rick was a Category 2 Pacific hurricane that struck the southwestern coast of Mexico in late October 2021. Rick was the overall seventeenth named system and the eighth hurricane of the 2021 Pacific hurricane season, as well as the fifth named storm and fourth hurricane to make landfall along the Pacific coast of Mexico in 2021.[1] Rick developed from a low-pressure area off the southern coast of Mexico that initially formed on October 21, 2021. The system organized into a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC the next day, and strengthened to a tropical storm six hours later, receiving the name Rick. In an environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, Rick rapidly intensified into a hurricane early on October 23. After briefly weakening the next day, Rick resumed intensifying and achieved its peak intensity on October 25 as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg). Rick made landfall at peak intensity later that day on the Mexican state of Guerrero. Rick quickly weakened as it moved inland, first to a tropical storm over the state of Michoac\u00c3\u00a1n before dissipating entirely late that day over Jalisco. A total of 2,260 shelters were set up across five states in preparation for Rick's landfall. Floodwaters from the hurricane stranded cars, cut off and destroyed roads, and uprooted trees. Rick caused one confirmed fatality when a man was killed after being swept away in the floods. In total, Rick is estimated to have caused over $26 million (2021 USD) in damages.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On October 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) started highlighting the chances of development of a low pressure area offshore the Pacific coast of Mexico.[2] An area of disturbed weather became identifiable south of the coasts of Guatemala and El Salvador on the next day.[3] Shower and thunderstorm activity was initially scattered,[4] and only gradual development was expected, although the NHC noted that the system would likely become a tropical depression by October 24.[5] On the afternoon of October 21, a broad area of low pressure developed just south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[6] Shower activity gradually became better organized,[7] although an advanced scatterometer pass early on October 22 revealed that the system had not developed a closed wind circulation.[8] However, a rapid increase in organization soon occurred, and following a Dvorak classification of T2.0/35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h), the NHC upgraded the low pressure system into a tropical depression at 15:00 UTC on October 21.[9] At the time of genesis, the depression was moving briskly to the west under the influence of a ridge to its north. Situated within an environment of little vertical wind shear, high moisture, and of warm sea surface temperatures near 86\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00c2\u00b0C),[9] the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm that evening after an increase in curved band features and upper-level outflow in all directions.[10] A central dense overcast subsequently developed, and microwave imagery indicated the development of a ring of deep convection, which is often a precursor to an eye,[11] which prompted the NHC to re-assess the intensity of Rick at 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and forecast rapid deepening at 09:00 UTC on October 23.[12] That afternoon, Rick attained hurricane status as the cyclone began to curve north-northwestward in response to a weakness in the ridge.[13] An eye briefly became apparent in visible satellite imagery[14] and following measurements from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft, the NHC set the intensity of the storm at 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). During the next 18 to 24 hours, the hurricane weakened slightly as it tracked north;[15] the cause of this arrested development phase was 15 to 25\u00a0mph (30 to 35\u00a0km/h) of wind shear and an environment of less than 50% relative humidity.[16] However, microwave imagery showed a 25\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km) wide closed eyewall had re-developed by the evening of October 23, a sign that Rick had resumed intensification.[17] Based on wind measurements from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft, Rick was upgraded into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale at 06:00 UTC on October 25. The storm also attained its peak intensity of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) at the same time along with a minimum barometric pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg).[18] At 10:00 UTC, Rick made landfall between L\u00c3\u00a1zaro C\u00c3\u00a1rdenas and Zihuatanejo while at its peak intensity.[1][19] The system then rapidly weakened while it moved further inland, towards the mountainous terrain of Mexico.[20] Early on October 26, Rick dissipated over west-central Mexico.[21]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Under the anticipation that Rick would make landfall along the southwestern coast of Mexico, a hurricane watch was issued on the afternoon of October 22 from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, to Punta San Telmo, Michoac\u00c3\u00a1n, with tropical storm watches posted east and west of the hurricane watch area.[10] Within 18 hours, these watches were upgraded to warnings.[13] The Servicio Meteorol\u00c3\u00b3gico Nacional warned that the states of Jalisco, Morelos, Puebla, Mexico City, Nayarit and the State of Mexico could see heavy rainfall, with the potential of flooding.[22] Four reservoirs in Colima and Guererro, along with four rivers in the latter, as well as three rivers and dams in Michoac\u00c3\u00a1n, four rivers and three dams in Oaxaca were monitored for flooding.[23] A total of 2,260 temporary shelters were set up for possible evacuees across five states.[24] Three ports in Guerrero, Acapulco, Puerto Marqu\u00c3\u00a9s and Zihuatanejo along with L\u00c3\u00a1zaro C\u00c3\u00a1rdenas in Michoac\u00c3\u00a1n were closed on October 23.[25] In Colima, a blue alert was issued.[26] While still at sea, Rick was responsible for 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) waves along coastal areas of Guerrero while winds from the outer fringes of the storm's circulation uprooted trees, although there was no major damage across the state.[26] A 35-year-old man was killed after he was swept away in the municipality of Tepoztl\u00c3\u00a1n.[27] Across Guerrero, 37 homes were flooded, including 30 in the municipality of Tecpan de Galeana and 5 in Acapulco, which resulted in 42 families seeking shelter. Two rivers overflowed their banks in Zihuatanejo and two more overflowed their banks in the municipality of Tecpan de Galeana. Statewide, seventy-five trees were uprooted and six roads were destroyed.[28] Across Zihuatanejo and Acapulco, cars were seen stranded in floodwaters and the Acapulco-Zihuatanejo highway was cut off by floodwaters in the municipality of Petatl\u00c3\u00a1n. Blackouts were reported in the Costa Chica and Costa Grande regions of Guerrero and extended as far east as in Acapulco. However, no injuries were reported.[29] The storm was estimated to have caused 521 million pesos (US$26.1 million) in damages.[30]",

      "Hurricane Kenneth (2005)": "Hurricane Kenneth was the strongest and longest-tracked hurricane of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. The eleventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Kenneth developed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southwest of Mexico on September 14. It quickly attained peak winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) on September 18, before weakening due to increased wind shear and turning to a southwest drift. After weakening to tropical storm status, Kenneth attained a steady west-northwest motion and encountered favorable enough conditions for it to gain power and attain hurricane status on September 25. The cyclone again weakened as its motion halted, and on September 30 Kenneth dissipated a short distance off the Big Island of Hawaii. The remnants of Kenneth produced one of the highest rainfall totals in Hawaii, reaching up to 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) on Oahu. The rainfall caused flooding, though no major damage was reported.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Kenneth are believed to have been from a tropical wave that crossed Central America into the eastern North Pacific Ocean on September 9. The system tracked westward within the Intertropical Convergence Zone \u2014 a belt of thunderstorm activity across the eastern Pacific Ocean \u2014 and on September 13 its associated thunderstorm activity began showing signs of organization.[1] Despite being located only 625 miles (1,006\u00a0km) east-southeast of the larger Tropical Depression Ten, the National Hurricane Center remarked the potential for further development of the system;[2] as the depression was further west and moving faster than the system, little interference from Jova was anticipated.[3] The system organized further, and at 1800\u00a0UTC on September 14 the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Eleven about 900 miles (1,400\u00a0km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The depression maintained a general westward track throughout its entire duration, due to the subtropical ridge to its north.[1] Initially, the depression was forecast to reach maximum strength as a tropical storm before weakening, and only the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's hurricane model predicted it to attain hurricane status. However, low amounts of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures favored further intensification.[4] After being previously removed from the primary thunderstorm activity, the circulation became situated beneath a persistent area of deep convection.[5] It is estimated the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Kenneth early on September 15.[1] The storm quickly developed banding features\u2014spiral rain showers of convection\u2014as its convection formed into a central area of deep convection.[6] These were all signs for further development,[7] and Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 16.[1] By September 17, the hurricane had finished an eyewall replacement cycle, meaning its original eye was replaced by a larger, better defined eye.[8] As a result, it quickly intensified and attained major hurricane status.[1] With a 23-mile (37\u00a0km) wide eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops,[9] Kenneth strengthened to reach peak sustained winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h), a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on September 18 about 1,725 miles (2,776\u00a0km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii.[1] After maintaining peak strength for about 18\u00a0hours, Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north-northeasterly wind shear;[1] this was caused by the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova, which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth.[10] While weakening, the hurricane turned to a southwest drift, due to a weakness in steering currents.[1] By September 20, its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane,[11] and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status. Reduced moisture in the atmosphere weakened the system further,[1] and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east-northeast of the convection.[12] Kenneth began a steady west-northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north. Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days.[13] However, deep convection re-developed near the center as the outflow became better defined,[14] and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days.[1] On September 24, the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened. Vertical shear sharply declined, allowing the convection to become more symmetrical and for an eye feature to develop.[15] On September 25, Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1,085 miles (1,746\u00a0km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii.[1] Hurricane Kenneth maintained minimal hurricane status for about 30\u00a0hours as it drifted southwestward, during which it entered the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.[1] Increasing shear weakened Kenneth to tropical storm status on September 26, and it began a steady northwest track under the influence of low- to mid-level steering flow.[16] By September 27, most of its convection had dissipated, excluding a small area of thunderstorms to the southeast of the center.[17] Convection intermittently reformed near the center, though the combination of wind shear and cooler water temperatures prevented restrengthening.[18] On September 29, an intensifying upper-level trough over the Hawaiian Islands weakened Kenneth to tropical depression status.[16] Thunderstorms failed to reform, and on September 30 it degenerated into a tropical wave about 40 miles (64\u00a0km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii. A remnant swirl of clouds later moved onshore of the Big Island.[16]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "The remnants of Kenneth produced rainfall in the Hawaiian Islands when they interacted with an upper-level trough,[16] causing some reports of flash flooding.[1] At Nu\u2018uanu Pali on Oahu, a gauge recorded a total precipitation of 10.25 inches (260\u00a0mm); the gauge also reported 1.6 inches (41\u00a0mm) in 15\u00a0minutes, as well as 4.11 inches (104\u00a0mm) in one hour.[19] Peak rainfall totals on Oahu included reports of up to 12 inches (300\u00a0mm),[16] which puts Kenneth in a three-way tie for ninth on Hawaii's rainiest tropical cyclones list, along with Diana in 1972[20] and a system dubbed \"B\" from the 1967 season.[21] On October 1, rains caused the Kaukonahua Stream to burst its banks and Lake Wilson to overflow behind the Wahiawa Dam.[22] The rainfall produced up to 1 foot (300\u00a0mm) of flowing water on Pali Highway, leading to surface runoff which flooded a few homes.[19] On Kauai, the six-hour total at Mount Waialeale was 6.17 inches (157\u00a0mm).[16] Flash flooding occurred on the Hanalei River, which resulted in the closure of the Kuhio Highway at the Hanalei Bridge. Rapid water level rises also occurred on the Wailua River and the Hanapepe River, though no significant damages were reported along these waterways.[19] Large swells churned up by Kenneth generated surf of 8\u201310\u00a0ft (2.4\u20133.0\u00a0m) that crashed ashore on September 30 along the east shores of the islands of Hawaii, Kauai, Molokai, Maui, and Oahu. No reports of injuries or serious damage were received.[22] During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Kenneth, citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat or damage.[23] However, the World Meteorological Organization did not approve the request, and the name was reused for the 2011 season.[24]",

      "Tropical Storm Charley (1998)": "Tropical Storm Charley was the third named storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. Charley was the first of two tropical storms to make landfall in Texas during that season (Frances being the other).[1] The storm originated with a tropical wave that moved off the West African coast on August 9.[2] The wave moved generally west-northwestward, producing occasional bursts of convection, finally arriving in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico by August 19, when animated satellite images began to indicate it had possibly developed a low pressure centre.[2] Hurricane Hunter investigations into the system the next day revealed that this was not the case. The system lingered for two days, lacking an organized low level centre of circulation until early on the morning of August 21, when advisories were initiated on the tropical depression, 185 miles (298\u00a0km) east of Brownsville, Texas.[3] The depression became a tropical storm later that day, as it moved steadily west-northwestward, strengthening, and then weakening again before making landfall the next morning around Port Aransas, Texas.[4] The storm moved slowly inland and finally dissipated on the morning of the August 24 near the town of Del Rio, Texas. Charley's impacts in Texas and Mexico were locally severe. In Texas, over 2000 homes were destroyed by the locally severe flooding, and 13\u00a0people died. In Mexico, over 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of rain fell in northern areas near the Texas-Mexico border, and seven people were killed.[2]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Charley originated with a large swirl of clouds which parted off of the west coast of Africa on August 9. Lacking deep convection or a well defined centre, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, satellite images indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation centre was present.[2] The following morning, a second flight reported that a centre had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression.[2] Initially, the centre was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.[5] As the system continued west-northwestward, more organized banding features developed, and the storm began to intensify.[2] On August 22, it reached its peak intensity of 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h).[6] Subsequent reconnaissance reports indicated that winds had decreased, and the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas early on August 23, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour (72\u00a0km/h). Within hours, Charley was downgraded to tropical depression status as it continued to weaken.[7] By August 24, Charley had dissipated over the Rio Grande near Del Rio, Texas. Although surface winds had diminished and a closed surface circulation no longer existed, a slow-moving remnant circulation aloft persisted in the Del Rio area and generated flooding rains that were most devastating in that area on August 23 and 24.[2]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Tropical storm warnings were issued by the National Hurricane Center coincidentally with the first advisory on the depression, from High Island, Texas to Brownsville.[2] Six hours later, these were extended eastward to Cameron, Louisiana. At landfall on August 22, the warnings north of Sabine Pass, Texas were expired, and the rest were dropped later that day.[2] In advance of the storm, thousands of oil workers were evacuated from Gulf of Mexico oil rigs.[8] In Del Rio, some highways and roads were closed after the initial flooding, in anticipation of more flooding as the system stalled over the area.[9] Of the 2000 Laredo, Texas residents ordered to leave their homes in anticipation of the Rio Grande overflowing its banks, only 600 actually did so.[10]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Being relatively weak, the storm's main impact was its heavy rainfall. Prolific, sometimes record amounts fell over much of south central Texas and northern Mexico.[2] Few areas received sustained tropical storm force winds, and the storm surge was insignificant.[2] There were no confirmed tornadoes.[11]\nTwenty people died, all from drowning, and the storm caused $50\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD; US$64\u00a0million in 2007) in damage.[12]",
      "Texas[edit]": "The storm's major impact was its very heavy rain. A 90-mile (140\u00a0km) wide swath of over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) of rainfall extended from the Middle Texas Coast west to the Texas-Mexico border. Charley produced 17 inches (430\u00a0mm) of rain in Del Rio in a 24-hour period, a new record daily rainfall for the city.[2] Refugio, Texas received 7.2 inches (180\u00a0mm) of rain, and Woodsboro, Texas recorded 5 inches (130\u00a0mm).[2] The storm surge on areas of the Texas coast was small. Port O'Connor recorded a storm surge of 2.3 feet (0.70\u00a0m), while Pleasure Pier was subjected to a 4.5 feet (1.4\u00a0m) surge.[2] There were two reports of sustained tropical storm force winds, 41\u00a0miles\u00a0per\u00a0hour (66\u00a0km/h) and 39 miles per hour (63\u00a0km/h) from Rockport, Texas and Galveston, Texas respectively. The maximum wind gust was 63 miles per hour (101\u00a0km/h) at Port O'Connor, Texas.[2] No tornadoes were confirmed by any NWS offices, although one suspected tornado did prompt a tornado warning.[11] Damage from the storm, while generally light, was severe locally. In Val Verde County, Texas, which took the vast majority of the damage, roughly 2000\u00a0houses, mobile homes, and apartments combined were destroyed by flooding.[2] At one point, two-thirds of Del Rio was underwater after a natural dam broke in the San Felipe Creek, flooding the city with a sudden surge of water.[13] The coastal storm surge destroyed several of the dunes on San Jose and Mustang Islands.[14] There was also slight damage on Matagorda Island, where two shelters were destroyed by the surge flooding.[11] Four people, including two toddlers, died when their truck was swept away by floodwaters and nine more drowned in flooding along the San Felipe Creek. Thirteen people died in Texas, all drownings.[2] Charley left $50\u00a0million (1998\u00a0USD; US$64\u00a0million in 2007) in flood damage across southern Texas.[2] Eight counties in Texas were declared disaster areas.[15]",
      "Mexico[edit]": "While Mexico was not severely impacted by winds from the storm, heavy rain caused serious flooding in places. Augosto received maximum sustained winds of 52 miles per hour (84\u00a0km/h) and recorded a minimum pressure of 1,003 millibars (29.6\u00a0inHg).[16] Jimenez received 14.53 inches (369\u00a0mm) of rainfall. In Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, Coahuila, 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) of flooding occurred as a result of the heavy rains. 450\u00a0houses were damaged in the city, and over 2000\u00a0people were injured.[17] In Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, heavy rains swelled the Rio Grande and caused significant flooding. 350 families were evacuated, and the city lost power and phone service.[17] Seven people died in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a while they were trying to cross a flooded gully.[18]",
      "Louisiana[edit]": "Several inches of rain fell in parts of Louisiana. Lake Charles, Louisiana received the most, with 1.2 inches (30\u00a0mm). Isolated wind gusts reached tropical storm force, and Lake Charles recorded a 43 miles per hour (69\u00a0km/h) gust.[2] Charley did not cause any significant damage in Louisiana.[18]",

      "Hurricane Gert": "Hurricane Gert was a large tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding and mudslides throughout Central America and Mexico in September\u00a01993. The seventh named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Gert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September\u00a014. The next day, the cyclone briefly attained tropical storm strength before moving ashore in Nicaragua and proceeding through Honduras. It reorganized into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Honduras on September\u00a017, but weakened back to a depression upon crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Once over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, Gert quickly strengthened into a Category\u00a02 hurricane by September\u00a020. The hurricane made a final landfall on the Gulf Coast of Mexico near Tuxpan, Veracruz, with peak winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The rugged terrain disrupted the cyclone's structure; Gert entered the Pacific Ocean as a depression near the state of Nayarit on September\u00a021, where it briefly redeveloped a few strong thunderstorms before dissipating at sea five days later. Gert's broad wind circulation produced widespread and heavy rainfall across Central America through September\u00a015\u201317. Combined with saturated soil following Tropical Storm Bret's passage a month earlier, the rain triggered widespread floods and mudslides that isolated thousands of people across numerous communities. In Costa Rica, blustery weather destroyed a national park and led to significant losses in the agricultural and tourism sectors. Much of the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua and Honduras endured overflowing rivers, engulfing cities, villages, and crops with mud and water. Gert's winds were at their strongest upon landfall in Mexico, yet the worst effects in the country were also due to freshwater flooding after an extreme rainfall event in the Huasteca region resulted in water accumulations as high as 31.41 inches (798\u00a0mm). An increasing number of major rivers burst their banks over a period of several days, fully submerging extensive areas of land around the P\u00e1nuco basin. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate as raging floodwaters demolished scores of structures in what was described as the region's worst disaster in 40\u00a0years. In Gert's wake, the road networks across the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering rescue missions and relief efforts in badly flooded regions. National governments and emergency workers opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes and sources of income in the storm. Throughout Central America and Mexico, Gert claimed the lives of 116\u00a0people and left 16 others missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, amounting to damage costs of more than $170\u00a0million (1993\u00a0USD). Despite the excessive damage and catastrophic loss of life caused by the storm, the name Gert was not retired following the season, and was used again in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Hurricane Gert had a complex lifespan as a large and slow-moving tropical cyclone, repeatedly interacting with nearby landmasses and other atmospheric systems. Its genesis was traced to a tropical wave\u2014an area of low pressure oriented north to south\u2014that moved off the African coast to the south of Dakar on September\u00a05, 1993. The wave tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic at a rapid pace and relatively low latitudes, where its interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone fostered the formation of convection. On its approach to the Caribbean, the system developed a weak low-pressure center at sea level, which crossed Trinidad on September\u00a011. Although most of the cloud field brushed over the northern coast of South America, the system survived its contact with land and emerged over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September\u00a013.[1] There, owing to favorable tropospheric conditions aloft, the wave showed signs of cyclonic development, as its convection thickened into curved, well-defined bands. Given these structural changes alongside a defined surface circulation, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression at 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a014, when it was located 105 miles (169\u00a0km) north of the Atlantic coast of Panama.[1][2] From its inception onwards, the depression exhibited a rather large wind field on satellite images and radiosonde data.[1] Its broad cloud pattern gradually coalesced, and by 0900\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, the NHC had determined it sufficiently strong to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Gert.[3] The center of the storm proceeded west-northwestward, moving ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) at 1800\u00a0UTC.[1][4] Gert's interaction with land impeded additional strengthening; the storm weakened back to a tropical depression just six hours after its landfall. While the storm's center remained land-bound for nearly two days, parts of its large circulation abutted the adjacent Caribbean and Pacific waters to draw in moisture and heat. As such, Gert retained its status as a tropical cyclone on its journey northwestward across the terrains of Nicaragua and Honduras.[1] In doing so, the storm consistently defied the NHC's forecasts for its imminent dissipation.[5][6] On September\u00a017, Gert finally exited the coast, accessed the waters of the Gulf of Honduras and restrengthened to a tropical storm. Its duration over water\u2014and with that any opportunity for additional strengthening\u2014was curtailed by a mid- to upper-level trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico; it turned the storm to the north-northwest and brought it over the coast of Belize the next day. Inland, Gert began to interact with a high-pressure ridge to its northwest, which nudged the storm slightly more to the west.[7] After crossing the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and winding down over land,[8] Gert entered the Bay of Campeche offshore Champot\u00f3n as a tropical depression late on September\u00a018.[4][7] The open tropical waters, combined with light wind shear aloft, allowed the storm's convection to deepen and reconsolidate. At 0600\u00a0UTC the next day, Gert once more restrengthened into a tropical storm.[9] The storm veered toward the west and slowed slightly in response to a shortwave trough to its north,[10] granting it more time to mature over water.[7] On September\u00a020, data from a United States Air Force aircraft indicated that Gert had become a hurricane with maximum winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h). Within hours, it attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale, with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[7] At about 2100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, Gert made its final landfall at peak intensity on the coast of Mexico, just north of Tuxpan, Veracruz. The hurricane accelerated and weakened quickly over the rugged mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental, deteriorating into a tropical depression by September\u00a021. Despite its declining strength, the large circulation again remained intact as it crossed the country. Gert entered the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Nayarit later that day, where the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E.[4][7] What remained of the deep convection waxed and waned in intensity; satellite estimates show the depression may have briefly regained tropical storm strength on September\u00a022. It proceeded on a west to west-northwestward track with sparse thunderstorms for two days. Once the last of this convection diminished, the shallow cyclone was swept up by low-level flow. Steered farther and farther southwest, the depression encountered increasingly cool ocean temperatures. With any chance at redevelopment thwarted, the system dissipated at sea on September\u00a026.[11][12]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "After confirming the development of a tropical depression, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alert[nb 1] for coastal regions on September\u00a014.[14] The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country.[15] National television and radio stations broadcast warning messages to the public, and emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This helped with the effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones.[14] A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September\u00a015, extending south from Puerto Cabezas to the adjacent islands.[15] In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival.[16] Once it became evident that the storm would strike the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, coastal areas from Belize northward to Cozumel, Mexico, were placed under a tropical storm warning on September\u00a017 until Gert's landfall the next day.[4][15] While Gert was still located over the peninsula, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for the Gulf Coast from the city of Veracruz northward to Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas. By September\u00a018, it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and extended southward to Minatitl\u00e1n, although the initial watch area was placed under a hurricane watch after Gert showed signs of strengthening. The next day, the tropical storm watch from Soto La Marina to Nautla was upgraded to a hurricane warning as it became clearer where Gert would make landfall.[4][15] Prior to impact, several ports along the Gulf Coast halted their operations, and people living in risk zones were evacuated.[17] All warnings and watches were discontinued after the hurricane moved inland.[15]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Gert was a large tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan; it always remained close enough to the coast to restrengthen and redevelop strong thunderstorms. In consequence, the storm produced heavy rainfall over a large area, causing extensive flooding and mudslides from Central America to Mexico. The disaster resulted in at least 116\u00a0deaths and 16\u00a0missing persons; damage to roads, property, crops and vegetation surmounted $170\u00a0million.[nb 2]",
      "Costa Rica[edit]": "Although Gert's center remained off the coast of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1 inches (330\u00a0mm) of rain during the storm.[18] Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation.[19] The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequences. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.[14] The floods ruined about 500 acres (2.0\u00a0km2) of banana crop and damaged oil palm plantations. Small-scale farmers of reed, maize, beans, and rice were also affected. The storm disrupted local fishing and wrecked several small boats in Quepos.[20] High winds brought great destruction to about 65 percent of the vegetation in the Manuel Antonio National Park, vastly impacting the tourism-driven economy of Quepos.[19] Gert left moderate property damage in its wake; it destroyed 27\u00a0homes and otherwise damaged\u00a0659, mostly because of flooding. Overall costs totaled $3.1\u00a0million, of which $1.7\u00a0million was due to the impaired infrastructure.[21] Roughly 1,000\u00a0people sought shelter during the storm. Owing to the timely preparations in the country, only one cardiac arrest fatality was attributable to Gert when a landslide buried a home.[14][22]",
      "Nicaragua[edit]": "Moving ashore in Nicaragua a month after Tropical Storm Bret's passage, Gert caused excessive rainfall over already saturated regions.[23] Despite striking the Atlantic coast, the storm produced the largest amounts of precipitation over northern and Pacific coastal areas. A maximum of 17.8\u00a0in (450\u00a0mm) fell at Corinto; other significant totals include 17.6\u00a0in (450\u00a0mm) at Chinandega and 17.5\u00a0in (440\u00a0mm) at Le\u00f3n. The capital of Managua recorded 9.8\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) of rain during the event.[24] Sustained winds from the storm reached no more than 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) upon landfall near Bluefields,[4] though they downed trees and power lines and generated high waves of up to 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) offshore.[25][26] After weakening to a depression inland, Gert continued to produce moderate gales along its path through the country.[25] Off the coast near Big Corn Island, rough surf and winds destroyed nine fishing boats. Two canoes with an unknown number of occupants disappeared at sea. Gert produced significant coastal flooding on moving ashore near Bluefields and Tasbapauni, prompting about 1,000\u00a0residents and hundreds of indigenous Miskito villagers to evacuate.[25] Farther inland, prolonged heavy rain caused numerous rivers to overflow, which led to disastrous freshwater flooding, especially in departments around Lake Nicaragua. Three tributaries of the Escondido River, one of which rose 32\u00a0ft (9.8\u00a0m) above normal, overflowed near the city of Rama.[27] Reaching heights of up to 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m), flood waters submerged 95 percent of the residential space, entering houses and vehicles and displacing 17,000 citizens. All crops in and around the city were lost in the deluge.[28][29] In the Rivas Department, the discharge from the Ochomogo River near the city of Rivas inundated several communities, while C\u00e1rdenas, a coastal community along the border with Costa Rica, endured several days of flooding rains.[27] Damage in the departments of Chontales and Boaco was considerable;[29] floods in Boaco killed five people and affected 6,000\u00a0others.[27] The affected regions endured widespread disruptions in transportation as landslides moved onto bridges and roads;[23] in Granada city, the isolation caused sanitation issues and led to the death of a pregnant woman who could not be transported to the hospital.[30] In total, Gert destroyed 252\u00a0houses and damaged another\u00a0293 across 14\u00a0of Nicaragua's departments;[23] the storm was also responsible for considerable infrastructural damage and economic losses.[27] As many as 123,000 people were affected throughout the country, and there were 37\u00a0confirmed fatalities.[31] The impact on the ecology was profound: rivers, estuaries, and mangroves in and around lakes Nicaragua and Managua, as well as the inhabiting fauna, suffered from severe erosion and siltation.[32] Since flooding from Tropical Storm Bret had occurred just one month earlier, an exclusive damage estimate for Gert is unavailable. The two storms inflicted a combined $10.7\u00a0million in damage, primarily to private property.[33]",
      "Honduras[edit]": "Although it had weakened to a depression, Gert continued to drop significant rainfall while crossing Honduras. In Tegucigalpa, at least 6.77\u00a0in (172\u00a0mm) of rain were recorded.[34] Damaging floods swept through 13\u00a0of the country's 18 departments; however, northern Honduras and the Mosquitia Region, which had already endured the onslaught of Tropical Storm Bret in the previous month, bore the brunt of the devastation. The additional flooding from Gert affected 24,000\u00a0people in the region and made communication with surrounding areas nearly impossible.[16] Elsewhere, the rain filled several major rivers, including the Ul\u00faa;[35] many rivers across the Sula Valley had their banks destroyed, flooding much of San Pedro Sula\u2014the country's second-largest city\u2014and adjacent municipalities in the Cort\u00e9s Department. The rising water prompted many residents to evacuate, and the Ram\u00f3n Villeda Morales International Airport halted all of its operations.[16] The storm devastated Puerto Cort\u00e9s, one of the most important port cities in Central America.[36] Elsewhere in the Cort\u00e9s Department, a river in Choloma overflowed and triggered widespread flooding;[35] landslides in that area claimed the lives of six people.[37] In all, Gert wrought $10\u00a0million worth of damage to roads, bridges, and property.[34] The country's agriculture was devastated, losing about 5,700 acres (23\u00a0km2) of low-lying farmland with banana, sugar, and citrus crops.[16][38] The disaster affected 67,447\u00a0people, of which roughly 60\u00a0percent had to evacuate from their homes. In its final public statement, the government of Honduras confirmed 27\u00a0deaths, though 12 missing persons remained unaccounted for.[16]",
      "Elsewhere in Central America[edit]": "While passing through Central America, Gert generated an increase in cloudiness and showers across El Salvador,[39] with a maximum 15.35\u00a0in (390\u00a0mm) of rain recorded.[40] Strong winds uprooted trees or snapped their limbs, damaging power lines and knocking out power. In one community, mudslides destroyed a major highway.[26] The R\u00edo Grande de San Miguel caused an excessive discharge of water just southwest of Usulut\u00e1n,[39] washing out about 2,500 acres (10\u00a0km2) of crops from adjacent plantations. Several other areas faced significant losses from the flooding, including San Marcos and San Vicente; some property and road damage occurred in San Miguel.[26] Although fishing operations were suspended at the height the storm, four Salvadorean fishermen disappeared at sea.[39] Overall, Gert affected nearly 8,000\u00a0residents and destroyed twelve homes in El Salvador;[26][39] officials there confirmed five drowning deaths related to the storm.[39] In Guatemala, torrential rains from Gert affected approximately 20,000\u00a0people and killed one girl. The agricultural sector in the country suffered substantial losses from the flooding, though there were no specific reports of material damage.[26] Gert moved ashore near Belize City as a minimal tropical storm, dropping rainfall in coastal areas. Just offshore, a weather station on Hunting Caye recorded 9.5\u00a0in (240\u00a0mm) during the event.[41] Despite the rain, only minor flooding occurred in Belize City.[42]",
      "Mexico[edit]": "In response to the flood disaster, the Red Cross immediately began distributing aid to victims across the Huasteca region. After assessing the situation by helicopter, the President of Mexico declared the P\u00e1nuco river basin an emergency zone and ordered search and rescue missions.[49][50] Many homes sustained irreparable damage to their roofs, leaving tens of thousands homeless. The government appealed for international aid, seeking clothes, food, and medical supplies.[49] Five storage centers in Hidalgo provided more than 93\u00a0million\u00a0lbs (42,000\u00a0tonnes) of food supplies. Throughout San Luis Potos\u00ed, 142,000\u00a0lb (64\u00a0t) of chicken, 45,000\u00a0pantries, and 76,000\u00a0disposable plates were distributed, as well as 50,440\u00a0blankets and 6,081\u00a0airbeds.[51] Several schools served as shelters for the homeless;[51] the sheltered elderly, children, and pregnant or nursing women received $27,000 worth of milk powder donations.[49] In the wake of Gert, the amount of respiratory disease and skin infection cases rose slightly, although the overall health situation for the country remained well under control. By two weeks after the hurricane, over 65,000\u00a0people across the region had been accommodated in shelters; most stayed there until the floods receded, although many who returned home a month later continued to rely on relief provisions. A grant of $22,000 was made available for the purchase of roofing sheets for those in urgent need of home repair. The president approved $37.4\u00a0million to commence reconstruction of roads and houses and to assist farmers throughout the region.[49]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "",
      "Central America[edit]": "Because of the storm's impact on the country, the government of Costa Rica declared a national emergency on September\u00a016, 1993.[19] Emergency crews were dispatched to assess the damage and distribute life supplies to the affected population, including 90,940 pounds (41,250\u00a0kg) of food, 1,422\u00a0mattresses, and 1,350\u00a0blankets.[14] With much of the road network left disrupted across the affected regions, the country's agriculture, tourism, and commerce suffered considerable losses.[20] In particular, the obstruction of the major Pan-American Highway, which connects the central region to the south of the country, had a discernible impact on the local economy. Following the expansive flooding of farmland, many independent crop producers were unable to partake in subsequent sowings.[20] Prior to Gert, a state of emergency had been in effect for Nicaragua as a result of Tropical Storm Bret. National and regional aid agencies, including the Red Cross, accordingly extended their relief efforts with the passage of Gert.[23] Following the widespread muddy floods, many rural areas along the coast where the storm made landfall necessitated purification of their water wells and reconstruction of those that had been destroyed.[28]  Although the government did not reappeal for international assistance, several cash donations were made by overseas organizations through a transfer channel at the Swiss Bank Corporation. The United Nations Development Programme provided $50,000 for the purchase of fuel, and UNICEF distributed $25,000 worth of household supplies and medicine. The World Food Programme donated 160,000\u00a0lbs (72\u00a0tonnes) of food supplies and offered disaster expert services. The federal governments of Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, and Spain donated a combined $300,000 in aid.[23] On September\u00a018, the President of Honduras declared a state of emergency for several municipalities after surveying the affected regions by helicopter. The governments of Japan, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom provided a combined $310,300 for the purchase of relief items. Although most storm victims received aid within a few days, the deteriorated road network caused a large delay in relief efforts to the hard-hit Mosquitia region. Sewage systems and waterworks countrywide were in serious need of restoration.[16] With the destruction of its sole water reservoir, much of Puerto Cort\u00e9s endured potable water shortages for months in Gert's wake.[36] Public health concerns rose in the wake of Gert, with the cost of required medicines pinned at $208,000.[16] A contamination of the water supplies in rural areas exacerbated a cholera outbreak.[52] By September\u00a028, about 27,000\u00a0residents unable to reenter their flooded homes remained in government shelters. Seven weeks later, a temporary housing project was implemented for the 120 families most in need. Approximately 5,900\u00a0families across Honduras lost their source of income due to the storm.[16]",

      "Hurricane Martha": " Hurricane Martha was the only known tropical cyclone to make landfall in Panama.[1] The eighteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Martha developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November\u00a021. Initially, the storm developed with sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h), skipping tropical depression status. It remained stationary and quickly intensified into a hurricane. Martha attained maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) on November\u00a022. Subsequently, Martha weakened and drifted southward. On November\u00a024, Martha made landfall in Veraguas Province, Panama, as a strong tropical storm. The system weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over land on November\u00a025. Because the storm weakened prior to landfall, strong winds were not expected or reported in the impacted countries. In Panama, more than 13 inches (330\u00a0mm) of precipitation may have fallen in some areas. Agricultural land was flooded in Almirante, Bocas del Toro and streets became inundated in low-lying areas of Puerto Armuelles, Chiriqu\u00ed. The storm also brought significant rains to Costa Rica. Flooding and mudslides isolated most of the capital city of San Jos\u00e9. Numerous streets were inundated in Golfito. Damage in Costa Rica reached $30\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD) and 5\u00a0deaths were reported.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Winds aloft in the vicinity of San Andr\u00e9s, Colombia and the Panama Canal Zone indicated that a low-level circulation developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November\u00a020.[2] According to the Best Track, Tropical Storm Martha formed at 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a021, with an initial wind speed of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). Thus, Martha skipped tropical depression status. Centered about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) northeast of Bocas Town, Bocas del Toro, the storm remained stationary for 24\u00a0hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Martha immediately began deepening, becoming a hurricane at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a022.[3] Operationally, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories at 0300\u00a0UTC and erroneously indicated that it was a tropical depression and noted that conditions did not favor significant intensification.[4] Later on November\u00a022, a reconnaissance flight indicated Martha deepened to a compact hurricane,[2] and the tropical cyclone attained a maximum sustained wind speed of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[3] Reconnaissance aircraft measured a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg),[5] though it was later corrected to 979\u00a0mbar (28.9\u00a0inHg) in the post-season analysis.[2][3] The eye feature was about 46 miles (74\u00a0km) wide and it was described as poorly organized, although convection was increasing.[6] After reaching peak intensity, Martha began drifting due south and slowly weakened. At 1200\u00a0UTC on November\u00a023, the tropical cyclone diminished to a tropical storm, after winds decreased to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h)[3] and a reconnaissance flight recorded an increased barometric pressure of 999\u00a0mbar (29.5\u00a0inHg).[7] The storm maintained that intensity, and shortly before 1800\u00a0UTC on November\u00a024, Martha made landfall in rural Veraguas Province, Panama, about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) east of the mouth of the Calovebora River.[3] Operationally, winds were thought to be only 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) when the storm moved inland.[8] Martha was the only tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Panama,[9] although it is possible that other Panama tropical cyclones were not detected.[2] The storm rapidly weakened inland, deteriorating to tropical depression status early on November\u00a025, twelve hours before dissipating over southern Ng\u00f6be-Bugl\u00e9 Comarca.[3]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Residents were warned to anticipate tides 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) above normal near the expected point of landfall.[10] Later, the forecast was decreased to 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) above normal and pertained to tides in the Mosquito Gulf and Chiriqui Lagoon. Since Martha was a relatively weak tropical cyclone, flash floods were emphasized as the greatest threat. The National Hurricane Center stated that rainfall could exceed 10 inches (250\u00a0mm).[11] Additionally, Arnold Sugg of National Hurricane Center warned residents of gale-force winds and heavy precipitation, advising people living between Bluefields, Nicaragua and Almirante, Bocas del Toro, Panama to take precautions.[12] In Panama, the storm dropped at least 13 inches (330\u00a0mm) of precipitation, especially in the western portions of the country. As a result, at least half of agricultural land in Almirante, Bocas del Toro was flooded, causing extensive crop damage. In Puerto Armuelles, Chiriqu\u00ed, persistent rainfall led to street flooding and inundated other areas. Similar conditions were reported in Golfito, Costa Rica.[13] The effects of Martha resulted in five deaths, all of which occurred in Costa Rica. The nation incurred flooding from heavy rainfall, which caused significant destruction. The capital city of San Jos\u00e9 received flooding. In all, damages were estimated near $30\u00a0million (1969\u00a0USD).[2]",

      "Hurricane Felicia (2009)": " Hurricane Felicia was a powerful Category 4 Pacific hurricane whose remnants caused significant rainfall and flooding on the Hawaiian Islands. Felicia was the third strongest tropical cyclone of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season, as well as the strongest storm to exist in the eastern Pacific at the time since Hurricane Daniel in 2006.[1][2] Forming as a tropical depression on August\u00a03, the storm supported strong thunderstorm activity and quickly organized. It became a tropical storm over the following day, and subsequently underwent rapid deepening to attain hurricane status. Later that afternoon, Felicia developed a well-defined eye as its winds sharply rose to major hurricane-force on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. Further strengthening ensued, and Felicia peaked in intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 935 mbar (hPa; 27.61\u00a0inHg). After reaching this strength, unfavorable conditions, such as wind shear, began to impact the storm while it took on a northwestward path. Henceforth, Felicia slowly weakened for several days; by August\u00a08 it had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane, once again becoming a tropical storm the next day. It retraced westward towards Hawaii on August\u00a010, all the while decreasing in organization. On August\u00a011, Felicia weakened to tropical depression status, and soon degenerated into remnant low just prior to passing over the islands. After weakening into a remnant low, Felicia continued to approach the Hawaiian Islands and on August\u00a012, the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands. The highest total was recorded on Oahu at 14.63\u00a0in (372\u00a0mm), causing isolated mudslides and flooding. In Maui, the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages, significantly increasing the total water across the island's reservoirs. In addition, river flooding resulted in the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches. In all, only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Hurricane Felicia originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on July\u00a023, 2009. A weak system, the wave was barely identifiable as it tracked westward. By July\u00a026, the wave entered the Caribbean before crossing Central America and entering the eastern Pacific basin on July\u00a029. The system remained ill-defined until August\u00a01, at which time convection began to increase and the wave showed signs of organization.[3] The storm gradually became better organized as it tracked generally towards the west.[4] By August\u00a03, the system became increasingly organized[5] and around 11:00\u00a0am PDT (1800\u00a0UTC), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated the system as Tropical Depression Eight-E.[3][6] Convective banding features and poleward outflow were being enhanced by the nearby Tropical Storm Enrique. The main steering component of the depression was an upper-level low located to the north, causing the depression to track generally west before turning northwest after the low weakened.[7] By the early morning hours of August\u00a04, the NHC upgraded Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season.[1][8] Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29\u00a0\u00b0C (82 and 84\u00a0\u00b0F),[3] the storm quickly developed, with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique.[9] Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye.[10] Around 2:00\u00a0pm PDT (2100\u00a0UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.[11] Late on August\u00a04, the intensity of Felicia led to it taking a more northward turn in response to a mid- to upper-level trough off the coast of the Western United States.[12] Early the next morning, the storm continued to intensify and attained Category 3 status with winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h).[13] Maintaining a well-defined eye, Felicia neared Category 4 status[14] and hours later, the storm attained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.67\u00a0inHg) during the evening hours, making it the strongest Pacific storm east of the International Date Line since Hurricane Ioke in 2006[1][15] and the strongest in the eastern Pacific basin since Hurricane Daniel of 2006.[1][2] Around 5:00\u00a0pm PDT (0000\u00a0UTC August\u00a06) Felicia reached its peak intensity with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 935 mbar (hPa; 27.61\u00a0inHg).[2][3] After slightly weakening throughout the day on August\u00a06, Felicia leveled out with winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) and a 23\u00a0mi (37\u00a0km) wide eye[16] as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters.[17] Early the next day, the structure of the hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane.[18] Several hours later, the mid-level circulation began to separate from the low-level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long-anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii.[19] After briefly re-intensifying on August\u00a07, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August\u00a08.[20][21] Around 11:00\u00a0am HST (2100\u00a0UTC), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude 140\u00b0W.[22] By August\u00a09, increasing wind shear further weakened the storm, with Felicia being downgraded to a tropical storm early that day.[23] The storm rapidly weakened throughout the day as convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear. By the late morning hours, little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of Felicia.[24] A weak cyclone, the storm continued to track towards Hawaii with the only deep convection associated with it being displaced to the northeast of the center.[25] The system slowly weakened before being downgraded to a tropical depression on August\u00a011 as no areas of tropical storm-force winds were found by hurricane hunters.[26] Several hours after being downgraded, the CPHC issued its final advisory on Felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the Hawaiian Islands.[27] The system dissipated shortly thereafter.[3]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "By August\u00a05, forecasters were discussing the possibility of the storm impacting Hawaii.[36] Residents were advised to ensure that their disaster kits were fully stocked and ready.[37] Governor Linda Lingle made a speech to the state of Hawaii the same day. She emphasized that the storm was not an imminent threat but that residents should be ready and should know where the nearest emergency shelter is.[38] Since forecasters expected the storm to weaken before it reached the islands, only minor effects\u2014mainly rainfall\u2014were expected.[39] Hawaii County mayor Billy Kenoi was also briefed on the approaching storm and he advised the county to be prepared.[40] Stores reported an influx of shoppers and posted anniversary sales. Blue tarps for roofs were being sold at $1 apiece. The American Red Cross also reported that sales of the \"water bob\", a water container that can be attached to a bathtub and hold roughly 100 gallons of water, increased significantly.[41] On August\u00a06, the Red Cross stated that it was deploying a disaster recovery team, led by the director of the agency, to the islands of Hawaii.[42] On August\u00a07, five Hurricane Hunter planes were dispatched to Hickam Air Force Base to fly missions into the storm.[43] Later that day, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches for the island of Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai.[44] On August\u00a09, the watch was expanded to include Oahu.[45] The watches for the Big Island were later cancelled as the forecast track appeared to drift further north toward Maui County and Oahu.[46] The Red Cross opened shelters throughout the islands on August\u00a010. Twelve were on the Big Island, seven were on Maui, two on Molokai and one on Lanai.[47] The Honolulu International Airport ensured that eight generators were ready for use in case Felicia caused a power outage at the airport.[48] All tropical storm watches were cancelled at 11 a.m. August 11 as Felicia dissipated to a remnant low.[49]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Oahu[edit]": "In Oahu, areas on the windward side of the island received more than 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) of rain on August\u00a012 from the remnants of Felicia, causing many roads to become slick.[50] A portion of Kamehameha Highway was shut down around 11:00\u00a0pm HST when the Waikane Stream overflowed its banks. Flooding near a bridge reached a depth of 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m), stranding some residents in their homes. The highway remained closed until around 4:00\u00a0am HST on August\u00a014. The rain was also considered helpful in that it helped alleviate drought conditions that had been present for nearly two months.[51] The heaviest rainfall was recorded on Oahu at 14.63\u00a0in (372\u00a0mm) in the Forest National Wildlife Refuge.[52][53] During a 12-hour span, a total of 6.34\u00a0in (161\u00a0mm) fell in Waiahole.[54] Some areas recorded rainfall rates up to 1\u00a0in/h (25\u00a0mm/h), triggering isolated mudslides.[55] At Sandy Beach, there were two lifeguard rescues and three others were on Makapu\u02bbu as waves up to 18\u00a0ft (5.5\u00a0m) affected the islands.[56] There were also five assists at Makapu\u02bbu and one at Kailua Beach. Lifeguards issued a total of 1,410 verbal warnings about the rough seas to swimmers and surfers during the event.[57] However, winds on the island reached only 15\u00a0mph (24\u00a0km/h) and gusts peaked at 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h).[58]",
      "Other islands[edit]": "On Kauai, the Hanalei River rose above its normal level, leading to the closure of the Hanalei School. Several tree limbs and small trees were blown down across the island. Rainfall on Kauai peaked at 5.33\u00a0in (135\u00a0mm) at Mount Wai'ale'ale and on Maui, up to 4.05\u00a0in (103\u00a0mm) fell in Kaupo Gap.[59] On the leeward side of the mountains, rainfall peaked at 1.3\u00a0in (33\u00a0mm) in Kihei, an area that rarely records rainfall in August. Throughout the island, the total amount of water in reservoirs increased to 104.5\u00a0million gallons (395.5\u00a0million liters) from 77.8\u00a0million gallons (294.5\u00a0million liters) prior to Felicia.[60] Rainfall in some areas was heavy enough at times to reduce visibility to several feet. Streets in these areas were covered with muddy water.[61] Localized heavy rainfall fell on the Big Island, peaking at 2.76\u00a0in (70\u00a0mm) in Kealakekua.[54] In Wailua Beach, there was one lifeguard rescue that resulted in the swimmer being sent to a local hospital. Three other people were swept away at the mouth of the Wailua River, all of whom were quickly rescued.[62] In Honolulu, runoff from the storm resulted in large amounts of trash and debris along the local beaches. Private contractors were dispatched to the affected coastlines to trap and remove the trash.[63] Officials were forced to close the beaches along Hanauma Bay after swells from Felicia pushed an estimated 2,000 Portuguese Man o' War siphonophorae into the region. The beaches were later re-opened on August\u00a014.[64]",

      "February 25\u201327, 2010 North American blizzard": "The February 25\u201327, 2010 North American blizzard (also known as the \"Snowicane\") was a winter storm and severe weather event that occurred in the Mid-Atlantic and New England regions of the United States between February 24 and 26, 2010. The storm dropped its heaviest snow of 12 to 24 inches (30 to 61\u00a0cm) (locally as much as 36 inches (91\u00a0cm)) across a wide area of interior New England, New York, and Pennsylvania. The storm also brought flooding rains to coastal sections of New England, with some areas experiencing as much as 4 inches (10\u00a0cm). Aside from precipitation, the nor'easter brought hurricane-force sustained winds to coastal New England.[2] This storm was a complex combination of multiple systems, including an upper air low from the northern Great Plains states, and a surface low from the Gulf Coast states. As the surface low tracked northeast from the coast of North Carolina, the upper air low transferred its energy to it, eventually enabling the new storm to undergo rapid intensification near the shore of eastern Long Island. A strong blocking regime of high pressure over the Canadian Maritime provinces prevented the storm system from exiting to the east. This resulted in a cutoff low (not influenced by the predominant jet stream currents), which took a highly unusual track, retrograding west into New York state before looping back out to sea.[3]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Connecticut[edit]": "Many parts of Connecticut received heavy rainfall from this storm as well as high winds. Rainfall totals above 2 inches (5.1\u00a0cm) were widespread over the state.[1] Colder air worked into the state overnight on February 25, changing the rain to snow statewide by the morning of February 26. Schools were closed and train service was reduced on the Metro-North New Haven Line.[4] Snowfall amounts varied from less than an inch in eastern parts of the state to as much as 19 inches (48\u00a0cm) in western portions of Fairfield and Litchfield counties.[5]",
      "Delaware[edit]": "Northern Delaware received 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102\u00a0mm), and lesser amounts were recorded in Kent and Sussex counties.[6]",
      "Maine[edit]": "High winds combined with heavy snow were helping bring down power lines early Friday, leaving nearly 100,000 residents out of power in Maine.[7] An unofficial gust of 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h) was recorded in Cape Elizabeth.[8]",
      "Maryland[edit]": "Snowfall in Maryland from the storm was mostly limited to Garrett County and western Allegany County, where blizzard conditions and deep drifting snow made travel very difficult or impossible on Interstate 68 and U.S. Route 40 in the mountainous western panhandle of the state on February 26.[9] However, strong winds led to scattered power outages in and around Baltimore. As many as 12,500 customers were without power early on Friday, February 26.[10] A peak wind gust of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) was reported at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, and sustained winds of 30 to 45\u00a0mph (48 to 72\u00a0km/h) were widespread in the area, which led to the National Weather Service issuing a High Wind Warning for the area.[11]",
      "Massachusetts[edit]": "Unofficial wind measurements at Plum Island exceeded 90\u00a0mph. Sustained winds in excess of tropical storm force (39\u00a0mph (63\u00a0km/h)) and heavy rain caused large tree branches in the region to break. This led to power outages, and delays on area transport networks. A spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency reported 85,000 customers in Essex and Middlesex counties were without power the morning of February 26. MBTA Green Line service on the Riverside Branch was suspended due to fallen branches on the evening of February 25 until the morning of the 26th. A commuter rail locomotive leaving Rowley on the Newburyport/Rockport Line was struck by a large falling tree, resulting in a shutdown of service late in the evening on February 25, with service delays reported the following day. Flooding was also an issue in the area. About a dozen homes and businesses in Freetown were vacated voluntarily amidst concern that Forge Pond Dam on the Assonet River might burst due to high levels of water from heavy rain.[12]",
      "New Hampshire[edit]": "Peak official wind gusts of 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h) in Portsmouth and 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h)[8] at Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant were recorded. A gust of 132\u00a0mph (212\u00a0km/h) was recorded at Mount Washington.[13] More than 230,000 homes and business lost power due to the storm in New Hampshire.[7] High winds from this storm fueled a five-alarm fire that destroyed five homes in Hampton Beach. The winds hindered firefighters' efforts to bring the fire under control. No casualties were reported.[14]",
      "New Jersey[edit]": "Various power utilities reported outages in the state that affected about 14,000 customers.[15] The heaviest snows fell in the northern and western parts of the state, with locations in Sussex County reporting more than 24 inches (61\u00a0cm). Bergen, Passaic, Hudson, and Union counties, where many of New York City's western suburbs are located, reported snowfall totals of 12 to 20 inches (30 to 51\u00a0cm).[16]\nMiddlesex, Mercer, and Monmouth counties reported as much as 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346\u00a0cm) of snow during the blizzard.\nBlowing snow caused by strong winds created snow drifts; blockades for some drivers. Blizzard Warnings and Winter Storm Warnings were posted throughout the state of New Jersey. Ice and snow mixed to cause major roads to transform into hazards for all drivers. Most counties in the southern part got 2 to 6 inches (5.1 to 15.2\u00a0cm) during the storm but snow from the past storms didn't make it any better. Delays in Camden and Newark Airports were possibly 2 hours or more. Visibility was reduced to below 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) in most areas. Also, houses took major damage.",
      "New York[edit]": "The system began making landfall in the New York region as early as late Wednesday and was the most active area of the storm. The National Weather Service predicted that much of the accumulations would occur in the southeastern portion of the state, with hard hit areas getting as much as 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) of snow.[17] The storm left more than 150,000 homes and businesses in the state without power. In the Hudson Valley, almost 150,000 Central Hudson Gas & Electric customers lost power during the storm, the most in the utility's history.[18] The New York State Police reported two fatalities resulting from the weather. Heavy snow forced New York State troopers to close 40 miles (64\u00a0km) of Interstate 84 from Newburgh to the Connecticut state line, as well as sections of the Taconic Parkway. New York State transportation officials required vehicles to be equipped with snow chains or 4-wheel drive to travel on passable roadways within the storm's impact area; vehicles lacking chains or 4-wheel drive were stopped or turned back at inspection checkpoints.[19] In New York City, 20.9 inches (53\u00a0cm) fell in Central Park, mixed with slushy accumulation due to above-freezing temperatures during the day. Falling tree branches due to the heavy wet snow and strong winds resulted in one casualty (Elmaz Qyra) in Central Park[20] and created dangerous conditions on the streets. The New York City Sanitation Department deployed 1600 snow plow and 365 salt spraying trucks to keep traffic flowing smoothly on the highways and city streets of the five boroughs. New York City experienced its 5th largest snowstorm on record, 4th at the time.[21] This, combined with a winter storm earlier in the month resulted in February 2010 becoming the snowiest month on record in New York City.[22] Several private schools and institutions cancelled classes on Friday, February 26, due to the storm. City mayor Michael Bloomberg originally decided to keep the public schools running on Friday, but acquiesced later when the weather condition worsened overnight.[23] New York City area's three major airports canceled more than 1,000 flights. About 3,000 usually leave the airports daily.[24] New Jersey Transit canceled buses into New York City. Rail service in New Jersey and Long Island was suspended or delayed.[24] On February 27, ice from an upper floor of the Sony Building crashed through the building's atrium glass ceiling, injuring at least 15 people attending a Purim party.",
      "Pennsylvania[edit]": "On February 24, 2010, PennDOT officials initially requested through local media that drivers stay off the roads during the storm that was expected to hit Pennsylvania on 25\u201326 February. Officials said interstates and other high-traffic highways would be treated first. Secondary state routes were noted as a lower priority during the severe storms that impacted the state in 2009\u201310. PennDOT officials noted that they had more than 480,000 tons of salt in stock, and that so far, $159 million of the $180 million winter budget had already been spent. If that budget were exhausted, PennDOT would tap funds normally reserved for spring maintenance.[25] In the early morning of February 25, several communities in Berks, Lancaster and Lebanon counties issued snow emergencies.[26] The lower Susquehanna Valley in South Central Pennsylvania was expecting to see between 2 and 6 inches (5.1 and 15.2\u00a0cm) with isolated amounts around 8 inches (20\u00a0cm). Sustained winds at 20 to 30\u00a0mph (32 to 48\u00a0km/h) and as high as 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) were expected into the early evening.[27] At 1:00\u00a0p.m. EST on February 25, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission implemented a 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) speed limit for the entire length of the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a distance of 111 miles (179\u00a0km).[28] At 6:00\u00a0p.m. EST on February 25, the Turnpike Commission banned tractor-trailers, other trailers and box trucks which are Class 5, which is 30,001 to 45,000 pounds (13,608 to 20,412\u00a0kg), as well as all trucks heavier than Class 5, using the Turnpike's weight classification system for toll calculations, from the Northeast Extension.[29] On both February 25 and 26, the Philadelphia School District and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia canceled classes for all public and archdiocesan schools in the city of Philadelphia, as well as all archdiocesan schools in the nearby suburbs. Most suburban schools also were closed on both days. Due to the shifting track of the storm, the city of Philadelphia did not receive as much snow as had been predicted, with totals only approaching 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15\u00a0cm).[1] However, suburbs to the north and east of the city, the Lehigh Valley, and The Poconos did receive snow in excess of 12 inches (30\u00a0cm). Whiteout conditions and multiple crashes in the early morning of February 26 forced an indefinite closure of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in both directions between Carlisle and Breezewood.[30] At 6:00\u00a0p.m. on February 26, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission implemented a 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) speed limit between the Ohio state line and the Breezewood exit, a distance of 161 miles (259\u00a0km).[31] On Friday, PPL reported several hundred people without power, most of them in Schuylkill County. Met-Ed reported power outages in Adams, Lebanon and Berks counties.[7] In Pittsburgh, total snowfall accumulations varied between 6 and 12 inches (15 and 30\u00a0cm).  Overall, areas to the southwest of the city received lesser accumulations while mountainous areas to the east received substantially higher accumulations.  The storm created major traffic-related issues on the city's major transportation arteries, including Interstates 79, 279, and 376.",
      "Rhode Island[edit]": "Drenching rains from the storm may have caused a retaining wall in a Providence parking lot to collapse, leading to a washout of the ground underneath.[32]",
      "West Virginia[edit]": "Blizzard conditions and heavy snowfall in the eastern mountains of the state bordering Maryland led the West Virginia Department of Transportation to close a portion of Interstate 68.[33] A Blizzard Warning was posted as far south as Bluefield, West Virginia.",
      "Canada[edit]": "Over 50\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) of snow was reported in some areas of Quebec, with over 100,000 residents suffering power outages on February 26. Snowfall amounts of over 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) were recorded in parts of southern Ontario, especially in the Niagara region. Strong winds gusting up to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) and heavy rain and snow were reported on the 26th in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Snowsqualls combined with bands of westward-progressing snow over Ontario to produce heavy snow as well as periods of freezing rain in some locations.",
      "\"Snowicane\" controversy[edit]": "Prior to the storm the Accuweather forecast called for winds gusting to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) in some locations and predicted that coastal flooding and power outages would occur. They used words such as \"hurricane-like conditions\" and \"snowicane\" to describe the upcoming event. The National Weather Service forecast called for less severe conditions. National Weather Service meteorologist Craig Evanego said the use of these terms was not responsible, could lead to panic and noted that \"snowicane\" was not in the glossary of meteorology. The Weather Channel called the use of the term \"bad meteorology\". Accuweather defended the use of the terms, saying their forecasts are geared toward the general public and these terms were used to make the event more understandable to them. It was also noted that the barometric pressure would be equivalent to that of a Category 2 hurricane.[34][35]",

      "Typhoon Melor": " Typhoon Melor, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Nona, was a powerful tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines in December 2015. The twenty-seventh named storm and the eighteenth typhoon of the annual typhoon season, Melor killed 51 people and caused \u20b17.04 billion (US$148.3 million) in damage. The typhoon began developing on December 7 as a low-pressure area 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) of Chuuk. Soon, it intensified into a tropical depression on December 10, and then into a tropical storm south of Yap, and was named Melor. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAG-ASA) initially decided to name Melor as \"Nonoy\", but due to political reasons, it was named \"Nona\" instead. On December 13, Tropical Storm Melor (Nona) became a typhoon, and made its first landfall on Northern Samar. The typhoon made several landfalls in Sorsogon, Burias Island, Romblon, and Oriental Mindoro, before weakening into a tropical storm. It turned southward on entering the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea) before weakening into a tropical depression and dissipating in the Sulu Sea.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "During December 10, the Japan Meteorological Agency started to monitor a tropical depression, that had developed about 665\u00a0km (415\u00a0mi) to the south of Guam.[1][2] The system was located within a favorable environment for further development, with low vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures of between 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[2]\nMoreover, the JMA started to issue tropical cyclone warnings to the system on the same day, expecting a tropical storm within 24 hours.[3] Based on a developing low-level circulation center (LLCC) obscured by the mid-level deep convection in an area of strong westward upper-level diffluence and moderate easterly vertical wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) to the system early on December 11.[4] The JMA, however, upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm immediately after issuing that TCFA and named it Melor, when the storm was only about 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) south of Yap.[5] In the afternoon, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression and designated it as 28W, just six hours before the center upgraded Melor to a tropical storm that was tracking west-northwestward along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge.[6] The PAGASA was about to name the tropical storm as Nonoy, yet it was named Nona after entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility on December 12, owing to political reasons.[7] When Melor was forming an eye in the afternoon, the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm.[8][9] Due to low vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures above 28\u00b0C and robust poleward outflow enhanced by a very powerful Aleutian low, Melor intensified into a typhoon early on December 13, as tightly curved spiral banding was observed wrapping into a tiny but clear eye.[10][11] The JTWC upgraded Melor to a SSHWS Category 4-equivalent typhoon at noon. Although the eye appeared to be cloud-filled temporarily, the eyewall consolidated further.[12][13] Melor made landfall over Batag Island of Laoang, Northern Samar of the Philippines at 11:00 PST (03:00 UTC) on December 14. The JMA reported a peak intensity of ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 935\u00a0hPa (27.61\u00a0inHg). The typhoon formed a well-defined eye and then maintained it for several hours while crossing the northern coast of Samar.[14][15] Later, it made its second landfall over Bulusan, Sorsogon at 16:00 PST (08:00 UTC) and third landfall over Burias Island at 21:45 PST (13:45 UTC), resulting in a cloud-filled eye again.[16] Shortly after Melor made its fourth landfall over Banton Island, Romblon at 05:30 PST on December 15 (21:30 UTC on December 14), the typhoon significantly intensified again with a distinct 25-km (15-mile) eye and a compact core. Right before making its fifth landfall on Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro at 10:30 PST (02:30 UTC), the JTWC indicated that Melor had reached peak intensity with one-minute maximum sustained winds at 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), just shy of the super typhoon status.[17][18] Shortly after the typhoon made its final landfall, its eye rapidly became cloud-filled. Inflow along the southwestern quadrant was forced over the mountainous central terrain of Mindoro, and strong poleward outflow was also weakening owing to the decreasing linkage to mid-latitude flow.[19] Emerging into the South China Sea and moving northwestward in the afternoon, Melor started to encounter strong vertical wind shear as well as strong northeasterly low-level flow associated with a developing cold surge.[20] Melor was downgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA and a tropical storm by the JTWC early on December 16 when the upper-level environment was deteriorating and causing the system to disintegrate, leading to the steering influence shifting to the low-level flow.[21][22] Thus, the quickly weakening storm made a U-turn and moved southward. The JMA downgraded Melor to a tropical storm at noon, although the system's convection had been sheared away from the low-level circulation center.[23][24] Several of meteorological agencies downgraded Melor to a tropical depression early on December 17, including the JMA and JTWC, who issued final warnings on the system;[25] however, satellite imageries depicted an open trough instead of a discernable LLCC.[26] The system completely dissipated in the Sulu Sea before noon.[27][28]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Bicol and Eastern Visayas[edit]": "In preparation for the typhoon, 700,000 residents in several provinces were evacuated.[29][30] On Albay, work on all government and private offices was suspended, except for disaster response. Classes were also suspended on most of Bicol and parts of Eastern Visayas.[31][32] A no-sail zone was implemented in areas where the typhoon was expected to pass. Many flights to areas in Bicol and Eastern Luzon were cancelled on December 14, following the approaching typhoon.[33][34] On December 13, storm signal no. 3 was raised on Catanduanes, Sorsogon, Albay, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, and Samar.[35]",
      "Southern Luzon and MIMAROPA[edit]": "As the typhoon neared Northern Samar on December 14, PAGASA raised storm signal no. 2 on southern Quezon and signal no. 1 on Batangas, Cavite, Rizal, Laguna, and the rest of Quezon (including Polillo Island). Ferry services between Batangas City, Mindoro, and Caticlan were suspended when storm signal no. 1 was raised on Aklan.[36]",
      "Metro Manila[edit]": "The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority(MMDA) placed a yellow alert on Metro Manila as Typhoon Nona approached Mindoro.[37] Storm signal no. 1 was raised on Metro Manila when the typhoon neared Northern Samar.[38][39] On December 16, preschool classes were suspended on the whole region, while classes on all levels were suspended on Muntinlupa, Pateros, Taguig, San Juan, Pasay, Quezon City, Malabon, and Valenzuela.[40]",
      "Highest Public Storm Warning Signal[edit]": "",
      "Impact[edit]": "On December 14, Typhoon Nona (Melor) first made its first landfall on Batag Island on Northern Samar. On the same day, it made its second landfall in Sorsogon.[41] Typhoon Nona caused most devastation in Mindoro and Romblon. Oriental Mindoro was placed under a state of calamity due to the devastation caused by the typhoon.[42] Pinamalayan in Oriental Mindoro was worst hit, with 15,000 homes destroyed, 24,000 families (108,000 people) in evacuation centers.[43] 51 people were killed during the typhoon, and damages amounted to \u20b17.04 billion (US$148.3 million).[44] In Metro Manila, floods affected traffic and commuters. Water levels of reservoirs rose, especially at Angat Dam. More than 168,000 houses were damaged or destroyed. Several roads were also closed due to the typhoon.[45] More than 200,000 people stayed on evacuation centers due to the effects of the typhoon.[46] A state of calamity was declared on the whole country under Presidential Decree (P.D.) 1186 to speed up rescue, recovery, relief and rehabilitation operations following the devastation by the typhoon.[47][48] Several areas in Central Luzon, mostly in Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Isabela, and Aurora, were flooded by rain caused by Typhoon Nona.[49][50] Calumpit was heavily flooded, with floods 4 feet deep and 427 families evacuated.[51] Dams were also filled by water, almost reaching their spilling levels.[49]",
      "Naming issues[edit]": "Before Typhoon Melor entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) at first decided that the typhoon would be named \"Nonoy\". However, owing to its similarity to President Benigno Aquino III's nickname, \"Noynoy\", PAGASA renamed the typhoon \"Nona\", despite that name's usage during 2011.[7]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "Due to the severe damage caused by the typhoon, the name Melor was retired at the Fourth Joint Session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee and WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones during 2016. In February 2017, they chose the name Cempaka to replace Melor.[52] PAGASA announced that they had retired Nona from the rotating lists of tropical cyclone names in the Philippines. On January 20, 2016, the name Nimfa was chosen to supplant both Nona and Nonoy for the 2019 season.[53][54]",

      "Contents": "",
      "2016 Ethiopian flood": "In 2016, deadly floods hit Ethiopia, leaving at least 200 people dead and over 200,000 people homeless as seasonal rains come early to the country.[1]  The majority of these deaths occurred in the city of Jijiga while elsewhere, heavy downpours of rain were reported with more floods expected in the next few days.[2] The floods are reportedly at higher levels than other flood travesties than that of previous years.",
      "Background[edit]": "",
      "Flood Events in Ethiopia[edit]": "Ethiopia has extensive experience in flash floods and river floods.[3] The identified historical flood event years (1988, 1996, 1998, 2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016) in the country were also known as La Ni\u03aea episodes.[4]",
      "Flood Area Description[edit]": "Ethiopia has 12 basins, of which 8 are basins, 1 is a lake basin with perennial rivers and 3 are dry basins. Most major rivers are of a transboundary nature and cross-border. Many parts of these river basins are affected by prominent flash floods and river floods.[3]",
      "State of Flood[edit]": "The characteristics of heavy precipitation and distribution, as well as the preconditions of hydrological variables (soil moisture content, groundwater and surface water level), play an important role in the physical change of flood influence factors.[5]",
      "Climate and the Flood[edit]": "Typically, La Nina events are associated with higher-than-normal rainfall between June and September in central and highland Ethiopia, leading to flooding. Commonly, these La Nina events in Ethiopia were preceded by the drought effects of El Nino events.[6]",
      "2016 Ethiopia Flood[edit]": "In 2016, some areas in the Horn of Africa experienced flood events following the 2015 El Nino (drought) events. In Ethiopia, the 2016 flood event occurred with heavy Kiremt rains and caused many localized flash floods, landslides, and overflowing of rivers in Lower Omo Valley, Dire Dawa, Amhara, Afar, Somali, Tigray, Gambella, Oromia, and Harari regions.[7]",
      "Geographical and Physical Impact[edit]": "Thousands of individuals living within the flooded areas have little shelter or food and are exposed to terrible weather, with the danger of contracting diseases. The floods have also killed livestock and destroyed large areas of farmland.[citation needed]",
      "Impacts on Water Resources[edit]": "According to NAPA (2011), the water resources sector will be affected by climate change through a decrease in river run-off,[8] a decrease in energy production, as well as increased floods and droughts. Consequently, the ecosystem, which is the source of rain and water resource, will be affected. Rainwater scarcity would affect the aquatic life by deteriorating the quality and quantity of a water body.[citation needed]",
      "Impacts on Food Availability[edit]": "Because of irregular rainfall and droughts the country is experiencing deficits in food production in several areas, and likely increase in acute weather events, amplified aridity and a decrease in precipitation, range resources and soil moisture will escalate the situation. The availability of food has become a major bottleneck for millions of households in many parts of Ethiopia due to the repeated drought cycles and disparity in rainfall. Agro-pastoral and pastoral households, which are reliant on livestock for their livelihoods, also suffer severe asset losses during droughts.[citation needed]",
      "Impacts on Settlement and Infrastructure[edit]": "Climate variability, including extreme events such as storms, floods and sustained droughts, has marked impacts on settlements and infrastructure.[9] Indeed, for urban planners, the biggest threats to localized population concentrations posed by climate variability and change are often expected to be from little-characterized and unpredictable rapid-onset disasters such as storm surges, flash floods and tropical cyclones (Freeman, 2003).[10] Negative impacts of climate change could create a new set of refugees, who may migrate into new settlements, seek new livelihoods and place additional demands on infrastructure (IPCC, 2007).[9]",
      "Direct Impact of Floods in Ethiopia[edit]": "Floods in Ethiopia have direct environmental and socio-economic impacts; these include the impact of pollution on the environment and the socio-economic impact of damage to people's homes and economic property.[11]",
      "Casualties to People and Property[edit]": "According to statistics, nearly 20,000 families were displaced in Ethiopia in 2016 due to floods and unusual disasters that occurred in various parts of the country. Heavy rains triggered floods and landslides in Oromia and the southern part of the country, resulting in at least 202 deaths. More than 1,000 cattle were also killed and 559 hectares of crops were damaged.[12]",
      "Exacerbating the Consequences of Drought[edit]": "The drought and floods of the same year affected almost all sectors in Ethiopia, with the loss of crops and livestock and the impact of reduced water resources being significant.[13] Among them, the Tigray, Afar and Somali regions were severely affected, as the drought caused the death of almost 50% of the livestock in the region and affected 24%, 25% and 21% of the population respectively.[14]",
      "Contributing to the Spread of Disease[edit]": "Floods in Ethiopia often lead to infectious diseases, vector-borne diseases, malnutrition, mental health problems and damage to health infrastructure. Floods exacerbate the spread of diarrhoeal diseases due to poor sanitation, inadequate water supply and poor monitoring and detection. At the same time, floods have had a direct impact on the epidemiological pattern of malaria in Ethiopia because they create many breeding grounds for mosquitoes.[15]",
      "Health Impacts on Ethiopians[edit]": "The onslaught of floods poses a serious threat to the health of Ethiopians. Examples include direct deaths, injuries, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, psychosocial health and malnutrition.[16]",
      "Short-term Impact: Bacterial Growth[edit]": "During floods, the state of the environment is altered after heavy precipitation, for example, temperature, humidity and surface vegetation. These changes may favor the growth of pathogens. As a result, pathogens may spread rapidly through contaminated water.[17] As well as because of the difficulty of access to clean water already clean sanitation facilities clean water and improved sanitation, the rate of disease transmission increases again.[18]",
      "Acute Watery Diarrhea & Malaria[edit]": "The problem of acute watery diarrhea after the floods was exacerbated by the dense population, destruction of water facilities, and limited sanitation. In times of flooding, people may be forced to drink non-clean water (e.g. contaminated surface water) to survive. Water is often contaminated with harmful substances such as human and animal excreta and animal carcasses from upstream, making these infectious diseases very vulnerable to outbreaks.[19]",
      "Malnutrition[edit]": "Ethiopia has high malnutrition rates, especially among children, with 46% stunting.[18] The crops and floods suffered from food shortage in the region after the floods, leading to malnutrition among the people.[19]",
      "Long-term Impact: Immune-deficiency in Residents[edit]": "Malnutrition and diarrheal mortality are inextricably linked.[20] This is a vicious circle because malnutrition leads to deficiencies in the immune system, and conversely diarrhea leads to malnutrition because of reduced energy intake and malabsorption.[20] The potential for waterborne diseases is also exacerbated by the reduced physical strength of the population due to food shortages and limited temporary living conditions, as well as the degradation of turbid drinking water.[19] The poorer and more backward countries need time to rebuild after the disaster, and the healthy living standard of the Ethiopian people cannot be guaranteed in time.",
      "Response[edit]": "",
      "Local Response[edit]": "The National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMCC) acted in a leading role.[21] National humanitarian actors mainly include the Ethiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS), the National Flood Task Forces (FTF), National Meteorological Agency (NMA), Ethiopia Humanitarian Country Team (EHCT), Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (EHF) and other National Society branches. ERCS was responsible for supporting NDRMC by dispatching NFI stocks (emergency shelter and household kits) to affected regions(see Table 1) and setting up quick assessment teams within risk areas, and also monitored NMA\u2019s weather forecasts and basic health status among communities with the help of National Society branches.[21] In April 2016, a Flood Alert was released by the FTF to remind people of the seriousness of the flood risk.[22] On 2 September 2016, a joint plan was issued by the EHCT to help deal with acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) in Ethiopia, with the EHF allocating 5.4 million dollars in response to the funding requirements of AWD.[23][24]",
      "International Response[edit]": "Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners including IFRC, ICRC, Austrian RC, Swiss RC, Spanish RC, Canada RC, NLRC, and Swedish RC and other partner organizations including IOM, UNICEF, IRC, Save the children international (SCI) and Government of Ethiopia (GoE) participated in response to this disaster positively.[21] They actively reported these up-to-date risks and corresponding supports and IFRC, ICRC and PNSs participated in coordination meetings regularly.[21]",
      "Lessons Learned from the Disaster[edit]": "",
      "Early Warning and Response Analysis[edit]": "In early April 2016, National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC), Early Warning and Response Directorate warned that flood is likely to happen in flood-prone areas with high probability in the southern and south-eastern parts. Additionally, a flash flood is anticipated in the northeastern, central and eastern parts of the country. Taking into consideration the presence of the El Ni\u00f1o effect with anticipated above-normal rains in the belg season, the risk of flash and river flood is high. To remind that the concerned personnel should undertake appropriate measures ahead of time in order to minimize the effect of flood hazards in the areas.[25] NDRMC has reached 258,136 MAM children and women in priority-2 woredas of the country. Therefore, Early warning and response analysis from NDRMC can productively contribute to reducing the negative influence of disasters.[25]",
      "Improving the Water Conservancy Facilities for Farmland[edit]": "In some areas, the expected heavy falls would favour the season's agricultural activities, particularly for long cycle crops. Actually, the concerned department and farmers could take appropriate measures in order to make use of the expected moisture efficiently.[25] Therefore, the Ethiopian Government is planning to construct two new dams to mitigate Ethiopia\u2019s devastating and recurring floods in the second half of 2016. The decision comes just a few months after flash floods ravaged the country, causing as many as one hundred fatalities and displacing tens of thousands of people. It is also one of the important lessons brought by the flood disaster to Ethiopians.[26]",
      "Challenge of Humanitarian Fund in Financial Requirements[edit]": "The Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund (EHF) was instrumental in the overall response, supporting Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) endorsed strategies and priorities developed by cluster/sector task forces. In 2016, The AWD outbreak was exacerbated due to flooding in April\u2013May that affected 480,000 people, of whom 190,000 were displaced. In addition, other endemic diseases compounded pressure on an already overstretched health system. Overall, some 3.6 million people in Ethiopia were in need of emergency health interventions.[27] Financial requirements remained high across all sectors throughout 2016. The total requirement of the Humanitarian Requirements Document (HRD) was revised. Inadequate funding poses challenges to effective humanitarian.[27] Therefore, Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund may require further support in the future.",

      "Hurricane Lili": "Hurricane Lili was the second costliest, deadliest, and strongest hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, only surpassed by Hurricane Isidore, which affected the same areas around a week before Lili. Lili was the twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm developed from a tropical disturbance in the open Atlantic on September 21. It continued westward, affecting the Lesser Antilles as a tropical storm, then entered the Caribbean. As it moved west, the storm dissipated while being affected by wind shear south of Cuba, and regenerated when the vertical wind shear weakened. It turned to the northwest and strengthened up to category 2 strength on October 1. Lili made two landfalls in western Cuba later that day, and then entered the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane rapidly strengthened on October 2, reaching Category\u00a04 strength that afternoon. It weakened rapidly thereafter, and hit Louisiana as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on October 3. It moved inland and dissipated on October 6.[1] Lili caused extensive damage through the Caribbean, particularly to crops and poorly built homes.[2] Mudslides were common on the more mountainous islands, particularly Haiti and Jamaica.[3] In the United States, the storm cut off the production of oil within the Gulf of Mexico, and caused severe damage in parts of Louisiana. Lili was also responsible for severe damage to the barrier islands and marshes in the southern portion of the state. Total damage amounted to $925\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD), and the storm killed 15\u00a0people during its existence.[1][4]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on September 16. A low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the African coast and the Caribbean on September 20. The next day, the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression.[1][5] The depression moved westward in excess of 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h), and reached tropical storm strength-becoming Tropical Storm Lili as it passed through the Windward Islands.[6] The cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the Caribbean Sea, reaching an initial peak strength of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on the morning of September 24.[7] This was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening, and the storm's maximum sustained winds dropped to 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h) later that day.[8] The sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear.[9] The system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning, and remained in that state for nearly two days. Lili regenerated near Jamaica on the evening of September 26 and gradually turned more to the west-northwest while strengthening.[1] The system became a hurricane on September 30, just after passing through the Cayman Islands.[10] The storm continued on its course while continuing to intensify, and made landfall twice the next day, on the Isle of Youth and near Pinar del R\u00edo as a Category\u00a02 hurricane.[11] Lili emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that day, having lost little strength during its overland passage.[1][12] The system turned to the northwest and sped up, becoming a major hurricane on October 2 while 365 miles (587\u00a0km) south-southeast of New Orleans.[13] This intensification continued, aided by warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and good outflow.[14] The system reached its peak strength of category\u00a04 intensity, with winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), during that afternoon.[15] This strength was not maintained for long. The storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of October 3,[16] and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricane's final landfall near Intracoastal City, Louisiana, due to a combination of vertical wind shear, cool waters just offshore Louisiana,[17] and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant.[18]  By the time of landfall, maximum sustained winds had dropped to 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h).[19] The weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall.[1]  The system continued inland, curving to the north-northeast, and dissipated when absorbed by an extratropical low near the Arkansas/Tennessee border on October 6.[1]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Tropical storm watches were issued in parts of the Lesser Antilles on September 22. These were upgraded to warnings the next afternoon, and all advisories were dropped late on September 23 once the storm had passed.[1] Over the next week, the islands of Hispaniola, Jamaica, Cuba, the Caymans, and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula were all under advisories of some kind at different times.[1] Hurricane and tropical storm watches were issued for the Gulf Coast on October 1, and were upgraded to warnings the next morning.[1] They were discontinued after the storm moved past the following day.[20] Preparations in most of the Lesser Antilles were minimal as the storm only hit as a tropical storm. Two hundred people evacuated their homes in advance of the storm on the islands of St. Vincent and Grenadine.[2]  In Jamaica, all schools and universities were closed in advance of the storm, and 17 public shelters were opened on the island.[21] Preparations were extensive in Cuba. Military officials at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp prepared for the possibility of evacuating their Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners.[22] A total of 130,000 Cuban citizens, mainly in western portions of the island, evacuated their homes prior to the storm.[23] Significant action was taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, predicted to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent. Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana, including everyone in Iberia Parish.[24] A total of 200,000\u00a0people evacuated in Louisiana.[24][25] At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama.[26] More than 20,000\u00a0people stayed in those shelters.[25] The Red Cross also sent over 160,000 meals to the area.[26] A total of 3,000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations.[24] The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when the Kennedy Space Center was threatened by the storm, the first time a launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston.[27] Stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm. In New Iberia, Louisiana, hardware stores ran out of stock,[28] and businesses in Lafayette, Louisiana reported similar shortages.[29] Collegiate activities were also affected by the storm. Southern University canceled four days of classes because of Lili,[30] and 20 Texas A&M University Galveston, Texas students evacuated to the school's College Station location.[31] The University of South Alabama canceled two athletic events in advance of the storm.[32]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Hurricane Lili was both the second deadliest and the second most devastating hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season (Isidore killed 22 people and damaged $1.28 billion worth of property).[33] A total of 13\u00a0people died in the Caribbean Islands, and 2 more were killed in the United States.[1] Severe damage to crops and livestock occurred through the Lesser Antilles, and damage to buildings and other infrastructure was reported in other Caribbean nations and the United States.[1]",
      "Lesser Antilles[edit]": "Lili affected the islands as a tropical storm. Winds in the area were generally below hurricane force, although some gusts exceeded 74\u00a0mph (119\u00a0km/h).[1] Rainfall of up to 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) caused deadly mudslides.[2] The winds, combined with poor construction, tore the roofs off numerous homes and businesses. The majority of the damage was dealt to primarily to the banana crop.[34] St. Lucia lost at least 75\u00a0percent of its banana crop, and hundreds of homes were damaged by the strong winds.[2] Near total loss of electricity, water, and telephone services occurred, and utility systems were heavily damaged.[34] Four people were killed on the island, and total damage was estimated at $20\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD)[1][34] Over 400\u00a0homes were damaged in Barbados, and nearly 50\u00a0trees were downed by the high gusts. Similar to in St. Lucia, there was significant damage to the nation's banana crop.[34] Extensive loss of electricity and telephone service also occurred. Damage totaled at nearly $200,000 (2002\u00a0USD). Grenada also experienced moderate damage. A total of 14\u00a0homes' roofs\nwere damaged, and one was completely destroyed. The island Medical Centre's roof was also damaged, and 12\u00a0landslides were reported.[34] There was also mild damage to infrastructure, particularly in St. Patrick's Parish; three bridges were damaged or destroyed, along with seven utility poles and a water main. The entire island was without power at some point, but it was quickly restored in the southern part of the island where damage to the poles themselves was less significant.[34] St. Vincent and the Grenadines were heavily damaged, especially compared to other islands in the area. Several hundred homes and two schools were damaged, and the Rose Hall Police Station's roof was lost.[34] Still, the majority of damage was dealt to the agricultural industry.[34] In all, damage to the islands totaled $40\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD).[34]",
      "Haiti[edit]": "Lili passed offshore of Haiti as a weakening tropical storm.[1]  The storm's major impact was extremely heavy rainfall, in excess of 16 inches (410\u00a0mm) near the settlement of Camp-Perrin, Haiti.[43] This caused the Ravine du Sud River to overflow, and submerge buildings in the town. Two people died in the mudslides these rains triggered, and two more drowned in the flooding around Camp-Perrin.[44] The floods also seriously damaged crops and infrastructure; over 1700\u00a0homes were damaged and 240 were destroyed. Haiti was affected dramatically and many towns and villages submerged into rivers exceeding their bankfull discharge[44]",
      "Jamaica[edit]": "Lili affected Jamaica as a strengthening tropical storm. Wind gusts in excess of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and rainfall over 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) resulted in damage to homes, crops, and utility systems.[1][21] Extremely heavy rainfall inundated the island. Cedar Valley recorded the most rainfall, with 23.1 inches (590\u00a0mm) measured. This led to prolific flooding that triggered mudslides across the island and killed four people. These floods decimated the island's sugar cane crop, one of the island's principal exports.[21]  The resultant flooding caused widespread problems with the infrastructure of the island. All of the island's hospitals had flood damage, and three were also dealt structural damage by the strong winds.[45] The flooding caused latrines and other sewage sources to overflow into the intake sources for the water supply, leading to fear of disease.[45]",
      "Cuba[edit]": "Lili made landfall as a category two hurricane twice in Cuba, on the Isle of Youth and in the Pinar del R\u00edo Province, on October 1. Wind gusts up to 112\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) and rainfall amounts reaching 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) in some places caused damage to homes, businesses and crops. One person was killed.[1][46] Damage to buildings and other infrastructure was significant. The most severely affected provinces were Pinar del R\u00edo and La Habana. A total of 48,000\u00a0homes were damaged, 16,000 of them lost their roofs. The province Sancti Spiritus was not affected as severely, as only 945\u00a0homes were damaged, with 500 losing their roofs. The provinces in Eastern Cuba, including Guantanamo, suffered similar damage.[47] Electricity outages for whole towns lasted weeks in parts of the western provinces. This led to loss of running water due to unpowered pumps, and deliveries of fresh water had to be made to remote villages.[46]  The tobacco and rice crops were badly depleted, but it was difficult to differentiate how much damage was caused by Lili, since Isidore had struck the region just a week earlier.[46][48]",
      "Louisiana[edit]": "Lili made landfall on the morning of October 3 near Intracoastal City, as a weakening category one hurricane.[1]  Wind gusts reaching 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), coupled with over 6 inches (150\u00a0mm) of rainfall and a storm surge of 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) caused over $790\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD) in damage to Louisiana. A total of 237,000\u00a0people lost power, and oil rigs offshore were shut down for up to a week.[49] Crops were badly affected, particularly the sugar cane, damage totaled nearly $175\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD). No direct deaths were reported as early warnings and the compact nature of the storm circumvented major loss of life.[50] Vermillion Parish, the point of landfall, was hardest hit. Wind gusts in excess of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), along with a storm surge of 12 feet (3.7\u00a0m) dealt major damage to nearly 4000\u00a0homes.[49] The worst storm surge flooding occurred in Intracoastal City, destroying 20\u00a0buildings owned by a helicopter company. One person died after the storm, and 20 were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning.[49] Acadia Parish was also hard hit, recording wind gusts exceeding 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), and 5\u00a0tornadoes touched down in the parish.[49] Thousands of homes were damaged with over 2,500 suffering severe damage. Power across the parish was knocked out, 2\u00a0people were injured and one was killed after the storm. Schools in the parish also sustained $1.6\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD) in damage.[49]",
      "Mississippi[edit]": "Lili's outer rainbands dumped large amounts of rain and brought tropical storm force wind gusts to Mississippi.[51] Pascagoula, Mississippi, recorded wind gusts of 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h), and Picayune, Mississippi, received 4.14 inches (105\u00a0mm) of rainfall. Minor power outages occurred, mainly in southern Mississippi, and combined with the flooding of roads and buildings caused $30\u00a0million (2002\u00a0USD) in damage. No deaths occurred in Mississippi.[1]",
      "Other areas in the United States[edit]": "Hurricane Lili's remnants brought heavy rainfall, peaking at four inches in Arkansas, to the Southeast, before dissipating near the Arkansas-Tennessee border. Lili's remnants also caused minimal rainfall in the Lower Tennessee Valley. No major damage was reported.[1]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "President Bush declared Louisiana a federal disaster area after the storm, making it eligible for assistance.[52] FEMA set up three locations to apply in Mississippi and Louisiana. Applications began pouring in, 153,000 by the time of the deadline.[53][54] Over $311\u00a0million in aid was granted to Louisiana.[55] A total of $50\u00a0million of that money was in the form of low interest loans, and not actual grants. Over 1,000\u00a0power workers from eight different states went to the worst hit areas to help restore power.[56][57] Seven states sent tree trimmers to help clear debris from power lines and roads to speed the recovery process.[58] In addition, FEMA gave SLEMCO, the state's power company, an $8.6\u00a0million grant, which paid for 75% of the damage to the electrical grid there.[59] It took up to four weeks to restore power to all customers.[60] Hurricane Lili caused great environmental damage to the marshes and barrier islands in Louisiana. Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp. The barrier islands to the east of the landfall point, those subjected to the highest surge, were severely eroded. Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes, burying vegetation. The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge, some of them completely destroyed. The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico, which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons.[61]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "Due to the widespread and heavy damage caused by the hurricane, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Lili in the spring of 2004. It was replaced with Laura for the 2008 season.[62][63]",

      "Hurricane Karen (2001)": " Hurricane Karen was a hurricane of non-tropical origin that formed in October of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed out of the interaction between a cold front and an upper level trough on October 10 located to the south of Bermuda, and quickly strengthened as an extratropical storm. The storm passed near Bermuda on October 12, producing hurricane-force winds on the island. It then organized, becoming a subtropical cyclone on October 12 and a tropical cyclone on October 13. Karen strengthened to reach 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) winds as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. It quickly became extratropical. On Bermuda, winds from the precursor extratropical storm produced moderate damage, primarily to power lines and marine interests. Over 2/3 of the island's power subscribers were left without power during the worst of the storm, and several boats sank or ran aground from the high winds. Damage on Bermuda totaled to over $1.4\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD; $1.7\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD). In Atlantic Canada, Tropical Storm Karen produced light winds and rain, but caused minimal damage.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A cold front stalled a couple hundred miles southeast of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence\u2014the rate at which a fluid moves\u2014the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused the interaction between the trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345 miles (555\u00a0km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35 miles (56\u00a0km) south of Bermuda.[1] While passing to the south of Bermuda, the subtropical storm maintained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), with wind gusts on the island surpassing 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). After becoming dissociated from the Westerlies, the system turned northward, and began to develop convection over the center. In addition, the frontal characteristics of the subtropical storm continually weakened. On October 13, based on an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit observation that stated that a warm core was present throughout the system, the National Hurricane Center designated the system as a tropical storm, and gave it the name Karen. At this point, Karen was located 200 miles (320\u00a0km) north of Bermuda.[1] Karen slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream,[2] and the storm intensified to a hurricane later on October 13.[1] Convection continued to develop, and organized into a ring around the eye as Karen reached its peak intensity of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) on October 14 while located about 400 miles (640\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia.[1][3] Karen quickly weakened as it moved over cooler waters,[3] and late on October 14 it degenerated back into a tropical storm as it accelerated northward.[4] Convection gradually decreased,[5] and Karen made landfall on southwestern Nova Scotia with winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) on October 15.[1] Karen retained its tropical characteristics during and after making landfall, based on a research flight out of Halifax intended to study the early stages of extratropical transition. The flight reported arced bands and a warm-core system transitioning into a more typical mid-latitude system.[6] Under the influence of a mid-latitude system, the storm turned sharply to the northeast, and after losing the remaining of its convection it became extratropical shortly after landfall. Continuing northward, the remnant low quickly weakened, and dissipated as it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.[1]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "On October 10, as the precursor extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale and later a storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60\u00a0mph (80 to 97\u00a0km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings than they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing to the south of the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.[7] At the time of Karen's landfall, gale warnings were issued for coastal waters, while inland wind warnings were in effect for Cape Breton. In addition, heavy rainfall warnings were issued for large portions of Nova Scotia including Halifax, southeastern New Brunswick, Fundy National Park, and Prince Edward Island.[6]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Bermuda[edit]": "While passing to the south of the island, the tight pressure gradient between the precursor extratropical storm and high pressures resulted in strong winds on the island, including sustained winds of hurricane status at Fort George. Gusts on the island officially peaked at 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) at Devonshire. A cruise ship anchored at harbor reported a wind gust of 118\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), though it could have been caused by a downdraft.[1] The storm also dropped moderate rainfall of just over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm),[8] resulting in minor flooding of streets.[1] Because the storm developed quickly, wave-induced beach erosion was minor.[7] The strong winds left considerable tree and powerline damage. At the worst of the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000\u00a0power subscribers were without electricity.[1] Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001\u00a0USD, $468,700 2008\u00a0USD).[9] The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at St. George's Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking.[1] In all, 87\u00a0boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001\u00a0USD, $809,600 2008\u00a0USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175\u00a0properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001\u00a0USD, $517,400 2008\u00a0USD).[10] Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4\u00a0million (2001\u00a0USD, $1.7\u00a0million 2008\u00a0USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred.[7]",
      "Canada[edit]": "Tropical Storm Karen produced light to moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) with a gust of 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26\u00a0mph (42\u00a0km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.[1] Rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 1.8 inches (46\u00a0mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and 1.4 inches (36\u00a0mm) in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in a short amount of time. Skewed to the left side of the transitioning storm,[6] the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast-moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around half an inch of rain.[1] A buoy in Halifax Harbour reported wave heights of up to 16.7 feet (5.1\u00a0m), causing breaking waves at docks white caps along the ocean. Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches.[6] There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.[1]",

      "Storm Alex": "Storm Alex was a powerful early-season extratropical cyclone that was particularly notable for its extreme flooding around the Mediterranean. Alex caused widespread wind and flooding damage across Europe, and at least 16 fatalities, with one more 1 person missing. Alex was the first named storm in the 2020\u201321 European windstorm season. Originally, a minor low-pressure system to the south west of Greenland late on 27 September.[1] This pressure system tracked south eastwards, experiencing the Fujiwhara effect and then undergoing explosive cyclogenesis before making landfall in Brittany on 1 October. It was named by AEMET and M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France on 30 September, with Red warnings being issued for wind for parts of Northern France from 16:00 CET on 1 October.[2] The storm led to advection of Mediterranean air northwards where it interacted with the coastal topography producing an extremely heavy rainfall in southeast France, known as a \"Mediterranean Episode\". This brought record breaking flooding and devastation to many areas in the region.[3] The flooding in the south of France was purportedly the worst for at least 120 years, when records began.[4]",

      "Tropical Storm Warren (1984)": " Severe Tropical Storm Warren, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Reming, affected the Philippines during October 1984. An area of convection was first observed on October 17 in the Philippine Sea. After killing 17 while crossing the archipelago, the system developed into a tropical storm on October 23. Warren moved north and later north-northwest but late on October 24, the storm began to meander in the South China Sea. On October 26, Warren drifted west while attaining peak strength. Two days later, Warren turned back to the east-northeast and away from the Philippines. A weakened trend began on October 29 as the storm entertained cooler, drier air. Despite this, the storm's center of circulation remained well-defined until Warren moved ashore in Vietnam on November 1. Warren dissipated the next day. Offshore the Philippines, the vessel Venus sunk due to rough seas caused by the storm. As a result of the shipwreck, 29 people were killed. a total of 174 were rescued, including 96 people that were rescued via a fishing boat. Nearby, another cargo container ship, the Lorcon 8, sank but all 19 crewmen were rescued. Across the island chain, 73 people died, 25 due to landslides, while 18 others were injured. Greater than 10,000 people were directly affected by the typhoon. Moreover, 740 houses were destroyed, with an additional 891 damaged. Damage was estimated at $239,000 (1984 USD), with $59,000 from crops and $180,000 from infrastructure.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The precursor of Tropical Storm Warren was first noted on October 17 as a poorly organized area of convection over 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) northeast of Mindanao Island. Initially, synoptic data suggested that the storm's circulation was broad, ill-defined, and positioned over the monsoon trough. The disturbance began to encounter lower wind shear, prompting a small increase in organization. At 15:00 UTC on October 18, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued. The alert was cancelled less than 24 hours later, however, in response to a decrease in the storm's convection, as well as, strong wind shear and its close proximity to land. Over the next few days, the system moved over the Philippines, disrupting its surface circulation. Moving west-southwest, the disturbance entered the South China Sea on October 22. Despite initially remaining poorly organized, conditions aloft became much more conducive for development that evening, and aided by the monsoonal flow, the system developed a well-defined surface circulation.[1] At 00:00 UTC on October 23, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system.[2][nb 1][4] The aforementioned circulation was at first exposed from the deep convection, but by 03:00 UTC on October 23, the storm had rapidly become better organized. Following a further increase in the system's organization, a second TCFA was issued at 11:30 UTC. Based on a Dvorak estimate of T2.5, the JTWC upgrade the system into a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC,[1] although post-season analysis from the agency suggests that the cyclone was a tropical storm by this time. Early on October 24, the JMA followed suit and upgraded Warren into a tropical storm.[5][nb 2] Also around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) started tracking the storm and assigned it with the local name Reming.[7] Initially, Tropical Storm Warren drifted north[1] and then north-northwest.[8] Later on October 24, the center once again became partially exposed from the deep convection. Thereafter, Warren began to move erratically.[1] Early on October 25, the JMA classified Warren as a severe tropical storm.[2] After performing a small cyclonic loop, Warren, still embedded in the monsoon trough, began to drift westward, while a mid-latitude cyclone was located to the cyclone's north.[1] Later that day, Warren existed PAGASA's area of responsibility.[9] At 06:00 UTC on October 26, the JTWC designated Warren a typhoon while increasing the intensity of Warren to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), its maximum intensity. Meanwhile, the JMA estimates that Warren peaked in intensity, with winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg), an intensity it would remain at for several days.[5] Starting midday on October 26, Warren stalled out for the next 12 hours, only to drift east-northeast in response to the inflow to Typhoon Vanessa and a trough to its north. On October 28, after re-entering PASAGA's warning responsibility,[9] Warren slowed and made a cyclonic turn back to the east-northeast as the trough moved to the east of Warren and a subtropical ridge became center to the north of the cyclone.[1] By October 29, Warren began to expand in size in response to a monsoonal surge of moisture into the South China Sea. This also caused the storm to inherit cooler, drier air, which prompted weakening[1] while also recurving towards the northeast.[8] At 00:00 UTC on October 29, the JTWC downgraded Warren into a tropical storm,[4] though the JMA would not follow suit until 36 hours later.[2] On August 30, the storm exited PASAGA's warning zone.[9] Thunderstorm activity continued to decrease, and by October 31, the low-level center had become displaced to the convection and the upper-level center. At 06:00 UTC that day, the JTWC issued the final warning on the cyclone while it was still producing winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph). Despite this, the storm's center remained well-defined for an additional 24 hours. The remnants of the storm later crossed the coast of Vietnam, with winds of 55 to 65\u00a0km/h (35 to 40\u00a0mph). Late on November 1, the circulation had become less defined and increasingly difficult to locate, and the JTWC estimated that Warren dissipated the next day.[1] During the afternoon of November 2, the JMA ceased tracking Warren.[2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "The precursor disturbance to Warren drenched the nations in heavy rains that led to the deaths of 17.[10] As a result of Warren's turn to the west on October 28, the storm posed a serious threat to the Philippines. All U.S. Navy and Air Force bases in the region were placed in \"Condition of Readiness I\" early that day. Although no major damage ultimately occurred on the naval bases, winds of 45\u00a0km/h (27\u00a0mph) and 222\u00a0mm (8.74\u00a0in) of rain were recorded at Clark Air Base.[1] In the province of Bataan, 30 houses were destroyed, which led to 200 people without a home.[11] A family of 13 died after their house was buried in a landslide in Aurora.[12] Elsewhere, twelve other people died due landslides.[13] Offshore Marinduque Island, strong waves generated by the storm sunk a 745\u00a0t (745,000\u00a0kg) vessel, Venus,[11] within three minutes.[14] Officially, the ship consisted of 83 passengers and 42 crewmen when it left Laoang for Samar Island, even though the captain claimed that there were as many as 240 aboard.[15] Later reports indicates that vessel had 200 passengers and 42 crewman on board.[16] A total of 174 were rescued,[13] including 96 people that were rescued via a fishing boat[11] and many others that was rescued by fishermen.[16] Twenty-nine people,[17] including two children, drowned due to the incident.[11] Nearby, a cargo container ship, the Lorcon 8, sank, but all 19 crewmen were rescued.[10] Nationwide, 73 people perished,[17] with 18 others hurt. A total of 10,815 people or 1,914 families were directly affected by the typhoon.[18] Furthermore, 740 houses were destroyed, with an additional 891 damaged. Damage was estimated at $239,000, with $59,000 from crops and $180,000 from both public and private infrastructure.[9][nb 3]",

      "Tropical Storm Winona (1990)": "Tropical Storm Winona struck Japan during August\u00a01990. An area of disturbed weather developed within the monsoon trough, located over the East China Sea, on August\u00a04. Despite the presence of strong wind shear, a tropical depression developed later that day. The depression initially tracked northeast, bypassing the southern tip of Kyushu. Thereafter, the depression turned southeast, and on August\u00a06, was believed to have obtained tropical storm intensity. In response to a building subtropical ridge to its southeast, Winona veered north while gradually intensifying. On August\u00a09, Winona peaked in intensity, and while near peak intensity, made landfall in Shizuoka Prefecture early the following morning. Winona transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a011, and was last observed on August\u00a014. The tropical storm lashed the Japanese archipelago with heavy rains, strong winds, and waves up to 7.9\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) high. More than 60 scheduled domestic air flights between Tokyo and western Japan were delayed or cancelled. Inter-island ferry service was suspended due to the storm. A total of 110 trains were cancelled or delayed, which led to 250,000\u00a0stranded passengers. Thirteen people suffered injuries, including three seriously. Seven reservoirs in Tokyo received more than 20,000,000\u00a0short\u00a0tons (18,143,695\u00a0t) of water, which allowed authorities to lift restrictions on water use. Nearby, in Shizuoka Prefecture, 55\u00a0dwellings were flooded, resulting in 211\u00a0people homeless. Nationwide, over 400\u00a0roads were damaged and 43\u00a0landslides were reported. A total of 686\u00a0houses sustained flooding. In all, one fatality was attributed to the storm and damage was estimated at 8.74\u00a0billion yen or $60.3\u00a0million (1991 USD).",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Tropical Storm Winona originated from a monsoon trough that was displaced 550\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) north of its climatological position.[1] An area of enhanced convection developed within the monsoon trough in the East China Sea around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a04. Six hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system as a weak low-pressure area developed.[1] At 18:00 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression.[2][nb 1][nb 2] Initially, strong wind shear left the center to the north of persistent convection. Following a Dvorak classification of T1.0/50\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph), the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 11:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a05. Twenty four hours later, the JTWC started issuing warnings on the system, designating the system as a tropical depression, after the system's convection structure improved and thunderstorm activity increased in coverage.[1] The depression initially moved northeast,[5] skirting past the southern tip of Kyushu,[6] only to turn southeast under the influence of the monsoonal flow.[1] On the evening of August\u00a06, the JMA upgraded the depression into a tropical storm.[2] Winona was in between two subtropical ridges \u2013 one in the Luzon Strait and one south of Tropical Storm Vernon. Early on August\u00a07, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical storm, naming it Winona. Wind shear began to relax; consequently, the storm's low-level center moved under the deep convection. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08, Winona abruptly turned north in response to a building ridge to its southeast. Strengthening was aided by the development of dual upper-level outflow channels.[1] Early on August\u00a08, the JMA reported that Winona strengthened into a severe tropical storm.[7] By this time, Winona was expected by both agencies to move over northeastern Japan, but Winona tracked further south than predicted, maintaining a northward course in the direction of Japan.[1] At noon on August\u00a09, the JMA estimated that Winona peaked in intensity with winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg). Meanwhile, the JTWC upgraded Winona into a typhoon; simultaneously, the agency estimated that the typhoon reached peak intensity, with winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph)[1] over 330\u00a0km (205\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Tokyo.[6] Early on August\u00a010, Winona made landfall close to Hamamatsu near peak intensity. After landfall, it began to accelerate northeastward and by 12:00\u00a0UTC, Winona was embedded in the mid-latitude westerlies and started a transition into an extratropical cyclone.[1] Eighteen hours later, at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a011, the JMA declared Winona an extratropical cyclone;[2] the JTWC followed suit several hours later.[1] On August\u00a014, the JMA ceased tracking the system.[2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Tropical Storm Winona brought strong winds and heavy rains to the Japanese archipelago.[8] A peak rainfall total of 545\u00a0mm (21.5\u00a0in) occurred in Hakone,[9] with 538\u00a0mm (21.2\u00a0in) falling in a day.[8] Meanwhile, a peak hourly total of 70\u00a0mm (2.8\u00a0in) fell in Harunasan.[10] A wind gust of 45\u00a0km/h (28\u00a0mph) was recorded on Mount Tsukubasan.[11] Offshore, waves up to 26\u00a0ft (7.9\u00a0m) high were recorded.[12] Due to stormy weather, more than 60\u00a0scheduled domestic flights between Tokyo and western Japan were delayed or cancelled.[13] Inter-island ferry service was suspended.[12] A total of 50\u00a0trains were cancelled and 60\u00a0others were delayed, which resulted in 250,000\u00a0stranded passengers.[14] Thirteen people suffered injuries,[13] including three seriously.[12] More than 400\u00a0roads were damaged[15][16][17][18][19][20] and 43\u00a0landslides were reported. A total of 686\u00a0houses sustained flooding.[13] One person was killed[21] and damage totaled 8.74\u00a0billion yen ($60.3\u00a0million USD).[15][17][18][22][23][24][25][nb 3][nb 4] In Akita Prefecture, authorities reported that twelve houses were damaged in Akita City while eight homes were damaged in Yokote, and there were two landslides.[26] Passing over Shizuoka Prefecture with most of its former intensity, 8\u00a0roads were closed and 28\u00a0homes were damaged. A total of 77\u00a0ha (190 acres) of rice as well as 212\u00a0ha (520 acres) of vegetables were damaged, along with three agricultural facilities. Damage was estimated at 243.1\u00a0million yen ($1.68\u00a0million USD), but the extent was limited by the storm's fast forward motion.[15] A 54-year-old hotel owner broke a rib when gusty winds toppled a seaside structure in Shizuoka.[14] In Fukushima Prefecture, seven homes were damaged in four towns, thirty-nine roads were closed, of which two were national highways. A total of 1,350\u00a0households lost power, and power lines downed several trees. The towns of Nakakura and Yazukado suffered flooding.[16] One person was killed in Toyama Prefecture.[21] A landslide closed two roads in Kmoagane in Nagano Prefecture.[27] Throughout the prefecture, 18\u00a0dwellings sustained damage and 68\u00a0trains were cancelled or delayed, resulting in 49,000\u00a0stranded travelers.[28] In Tochigi Prefecture, 141\u00a0houses, 266\u00a0roads, 284\u00a0communication lines, and 6 bridges received damage, while 10\u00a0homes were damaged and 23\u00a0landslides occurred. River embankments were breached in 710\u00a0locations while 221\u00a0ha (550 acres) of arable land was damaged, totaling 89.5\u00a0million yen ($617,000 USD). Damage there totaled to 1.32\u00a0billion yen ($9.1\u00a0million USD) and one person was hurt.[17] In Gunma Prefecture, 26\u00a0structures, 35\u00a0roads, and 573\u00a0ha (1,420 acres) of farmland were damaged. Prefecturewide, Winona inflicted 390.8\u00a0million\u00a0yen ($2.7\u00a0million\u00a0USD) in damage.[18] Along coastal areas of Saitama Prefecture, 60\u00a0houses were damaged, 158\u00a0ha (390 acres) of crops were damaged, 30 traffic accidents occurred, and five landslides were reported.[29] In Ibaraki Prefecture, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, which resulted in four downed power lines, while one individual was injured.[30] Damage in Yamanashi Prefecture totaled 6.62\u00a0billion yen ($45.7\u00a0million USD), including 4.80\u00a0billion yen ($33.1\u00a0million USD) in property damage.[22] To the southeast of Tokyo, in Chiba Prefecture, 35\u00a0dwellings were damaged, and damage amounted to 3\u00a0million yen ($20,000 USD).[23] Two people were hurt, a 56-year-old fractured his leg and a 78-year-old female fell due to strong winds, six embankments were breached, and thirty-two roads sustained damage.[19] In Shizuoka Prefecture, the prefecture where the storm moved onshore, the heavy rainfall damaged 541\u00a0homes, destroyed 55\u00a0others, and triggered 13\u00a0landslides, which resulted in 12\u00a0damaged roads and 21\u00a0people homeless.[20] The capital city of Tokyo was lashed with strong winds and heavy rain for several hours, with damage estimated at 34.9\u00a0million yen ($241,000 USD).[24] Seven reservoirs in Tokyo received more than 20,000,000 short tons (18,143,695\u00a0t) of water; the reservoirs reached 36% capacity, which prompted officials to lift restrictions on water use that were enacted following a drought.[13] Ten homes were flooded and damage totaled 128.5\u00a0million yen ($886,000 USD) in Kanagawa Prefecture. Seven people were wounded, mostly due to gusty winds.[25] The cyclone forced the first two days of the Karuizawa 72 Tokyu Ladies Open to be shortened.[31]",

      "1925 Florida tropical storm": " The 1925 Florida tropical storm was the deadliest tropical cyclone to impact the United States that did not become a hurricane.[1] The fourth and final storm of the season, it formed as a tropical depression on November\u00a027 near the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, the system initially tracked southeastward before turning north as it gradually intensified. After skirting western Cuba on November\u00a030, the storm reached peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) before striking central Florida on December\u00a01. Within hours, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. The system moved onshore once more on December\u00a02 in North Carolina before turning east, away from the United States. On December\u00a05, the system is presumed to have dissipated offshore.[2] Throughout the system's existence, it was responsible for 73 fatalities, most of which resulted from offshore incidents. The worst loss of life took place off East Coast, where the 30 crewmen of the American SS Cotopaxi drowned. Property damage amounted to $3\u00a0million, $1\u00a0million of which was in Jacksonville.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The 1925 Florida tropical storm was first identified on November\u00a027, 1925 as a tropical depression situated to the southeast of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, nearly a month after the official end of the hurricane season.[3][4] Situated over 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C) waters,[5] the system slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm status roughly 12\u00a0hours after forming, as it drifted towards the southeast before abruptly turning north-northwestward. Throughout November\u00a030, the storm quickly strengthened as it brushed the western tip of Cuba with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h).[3] Once in the Gulf of Mexico, the storm turned northeastward and intensified to peak winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[2] The lowest known barometric pressure attained by the storm was 995\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.38\u00a0inHg) as it moved inland.[2] Within hours of reaching this strength, the storm made landfall just south of Fort Myers, Florida early on December\u00a01 as it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone.[2][6] The storm was originally thought to have moved ashore as a minimal hurricane, thus becoming the latest-landfalling hurricane in United States history. However, a reanalysis in 2011 lowered the peak winds.[2] While crossing the Florida peninsula, the storm briefly weakened as it completed its transition; however, once back over water, it re-intensified.[2] Off the coast of The Carolinas, the former tropical storm became a large and powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining peak winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) along with a pressure of 979\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.91\u00a0inHg), measured by the USS Patoka.[3][6] Gale-force winds extended to at least New Jersey, where winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) were recorded.[2] Throughout December\u00a02, the storm gradually slowed as it tracked roughly parallel to the East Coast. Later that day, the system moved onshore again, this time between Wilmington and Cape Hatteras,[6] with winds equivalent to a minimal hurricane.[3] A strong area of high pressure located over the Canadian Maritimes caused the system to turn towards the east-southeast.[6] Over the following few days, the storm gradually weakened as it moved away from North Carolina. By December\u00a05, the storm was no longer identifiable and is presumed to have dissipated offshore.[2] However, a monthly weather review published in 1925 that documented the system indicated that the cyclone continued towards the east, eventually impacting Bermuda and the Azores.[6] Later analysis in 2009 concluded that a separate extratropical low, which formed near the remnants of the storm, was responsible for inclement weather in both areas.[2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "From November\u00a028 to November\u00a030, the storm brought light rains to most of eastern Cuba.[5] Although the cyclone had tropical storm-force winds at the time, the highest recorded wind in Cuba was 12\u00a0mph (18\u00a0km/h) in Havana and only 0.22\u00a0in (5.58\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the city. The Swan Islands, off the northern coast of Honduras, recorded 2.36\u00a0in (59.94\u00a0mm) of precipitation during a three-day span.[5]",
      "United States[edit]": "During its passage through Florida, the storm produced torrential rain over coastal cities, peaking in Miami at 14.08\u00a0in (358\u00a0mm).[2] The storm caused significant property and crop damage along the Gulf Coast of Florida. Trees, power lines, and telegraph wires were knocked down by high winds along the Suwannee River.[6] Communication throughout southern Florida was severed as miles of telegraph wires were downed during the evening of November\u00a030.[7] Structures previously considered safe from storms due to their location over 100\u00a0ft (30.4\u00a0m) inland sustained significant damage, probably from storm surge. Beaches along the Atlantic coast also sustained considerable damages from the storm.[6] Four people were killed near Tampa in two separate incidents . The first occurred when a house collapsed on three men, pinning them to the ground. The second incident occurred after a woman ran outside her home and was struck by a tree limb.[8] At least 12 workmen were killed and 38 others injured after the bunkhouse they were sleeping in collapsed due to high winds.[9] The facility in which they were working in also sustained $200,000 in damage from a fire ignited by the cyclone.[10] Throughout Florida, property loses were estimated at $3\u00a0million,[11] with $1\u00a0million in Jacksonville alone. Damages to the citrus industry  were also significant, with total losses exceeding $600,000.[6] Losses in Miami amounted to $250,000 as up to 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) inundated the city for more than two days.[12] Shipping incidents resulting from the storm caused several deaths. A schooner carrying seven people sunk, killing all its occupants. A tug boat sank off the coast of Mobile, Alabama while towing a lumber barge; the fate of the crew is unknown. A ship named the SS Cotopaxi sank between Charleston, South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba, with all 30 crew members lost. Near Daytona Beach, a vessel carrying 2,000 cases of liquor sank along with all six crewmen. The last incident, involving a yacht, occurred off the coast of Georgia. The ship sank near Savannah, Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning. The total loss of life at sea was at least 55.[6] Shipping throughout the East Coast was crippled by the storm as vessels were forced to seek shelter at port.[13] Due to the large size of the storm as an extratropical cyclone, gale and storm warnings in force from Beaufort, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine.[14] In North Carolina, heavy rains and strong winds were reported along the coast. Near record high water rises were recorded around Wilmington.[15] Cape Hatteras was temporarily isolated from the surrounding areas as the high winds from the storm knocked down power lines throughout the area. Several buildings along the coast and numerous boats sustained considerable damage.[16] As far north as New Jersey, gale-force winds produced by the powerful extratropical storm caused significant damage and killed at least two people.[2] Large swells and high winds throughout New Jersey, southern New York and Connecticut resulted in significant damage. Along the coast of Long Island, large waves resulted in severe beach erosion which threatened to undermine homes.[17] Parts of Coney Island were inundated by the increased surf, damaging homes and businesses. Several barges in nearby marinas were torn from their moorings and swept out to sea.[18] In Sandy Hook, several workmen were nearly killed after a building collapsed amidst high winds.[17] Minor precipitation was recorded throughout Rhode Island, peaking at 0.62\u00a0in (16\u00a0mm).[19]",

      "Typhoon Nina (1987)": " Typhoon Nina, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Sisang, was the most intense typhoon to strike the Philippines since Typhoon Irma in 1981. Typhoon Nina originated from an area of convection near the Marshall Islands in mid-November\u00a01987. It gradually became better organized, and on November\u00a019, was first classified as a tropical cyclone. Moving west-northwest, Nina attained tropical storm intensity that evening. Late on November\u00a020, Nina passed through the Chuuk Lagoon in the Federated States of Micronesia. After a brief pause in intensification, Nina intensified into a typhoon on November\u00a022. Two days later, the typhoon intensified suddenly, before attaining its peak 10 minute intensity of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph; 90\u00a0kn). During the afternoon of November\u00a025, Nina moved ashore in Southern Luzon at the same intensity. It gradually weakened over land, before entering the South China Sea and turning to the north. By November\u00a030, Nina dissipated. Across the Chuuk Lagoon, four people were killed and damage ranged from $30\u2013$40\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD). In the capital of Weno, 85%\u00a0of dwellings and 50%\u00a0of government buildings were damaged. Throughout the atoll, at least 1,000\u00a0people were rendered homeless, approximately 1,000\u00a0houses were damaged, and 39\u00a0injuries were reported. While crossing the Philippines, Nina brought extensive damage to the northern portion of the island group. The town of Matnog sustained the worst damage from the typhoon, where 287\u00a0people died. Sixty-one people died in the nearby city of Verla, where 98%\u00a0of all structures were either damaged or destroyed. Four hundred people died, 80%\u00a0of all crops were destroyed, and 90%\u00a0of all homes were either damaged or destroyed in the Sorsogon province. Nearby, in the Albay province, 73\u00a0people were killed. Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces, four-fifths\u00a0of all schools and half\u00a0of all public infrastructure were destroyed. Elsewhere, in Boac, 80%\u00a0of homes lost their roofs. In Bacacay, 18\u00a0of the village's 200\u00a0homes were destroyed. However, the capital city of Manila avoided the brunt of the typhoon. Throughout the Philippines, approximately 114,000\u00a0people sought shelter, approximately 90,000\u00a0houses were destroyed, leaving more than 150,000\u00a0homeless. Nationwide, damage from the storm totaled $54.5\u00a0million and 979\u00a0people perished.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "An area of convection developed within near the Marshall Islands in mid-November. Initially, convection waxed and waned, but on November\u00a017, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system. At this time, the system developed deep convection as well as good outflow. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 0100\u00a0UTC on November\u00a019 due to a significant increase in organization.[1] Five hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.[2][nb 1] Continuing to rapidly become better organized while moving west-northwest, the cyclone was classified as a tropical depression by the JTWC at midday.[1] On the evening of November\u00a019, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm, prompting JTWC to name the system as Nina, shortly after developing banding features.[4][nb 2] Initially forecast by the JTWC to move slowly, instead, Nina accelerated while gradually intensifying. At 1600\u00a0UTC on November\u00a020, Tropical Storm Nina passed 75\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi; 40\u00a0nmi) south of Weno Island in the Chuuk Lagoon.[1] Two hours later, the JMA upgraded Nina to a severe tropical storm.[2] After moving away from the island on the morning of November\u00a021, the JTWC upgraded Nina to a typhoon at 1200\u00a0UTC,[1] with the JMA following suit early on November\u00a022.[2] Shortly thereafter, Nina made its closest approach to Ulithi, passing 110\u00a0km (70\u00a0mi; 60\u00a0nmi) to the north. At 1600 UTC, Nina tracked about 175\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi; 95\u00a0nmi) north of Yap.[1] Typhoon Nina accelerated slightly as it traversed the open waters of the Philippine Sea. The storm continued to slowly deepen, though early on November\u00a023, the system leveled off in intensity.[1] That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Sisang, upon entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[6] However, midday on November\u00a024, Nina entered a phase of explosive intensification , at a rate of 1.33\u00a0mbar (0.039\u00a0inHg) an hour.[1] Despite this, the JMA only increased the intensity slightly to 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph; 90\u00a0kn).[2] After developing a well-defined eye, the JTWC reported that Nina attained its peak intensity of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph; 145\u00a0kn), making it a low-end Category\u00a05 system on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. At 1500\u00a0UTC on November\u00a025, Nina moved ashore as it made landfall along the southern tip of Luzon at its peak intensity.[1] Despite land interaction, little change in strength occurred until 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a026, at that time, the system began to weaken.[2] After traversing Luzon and Mindoro, the JTWC reduced the wind speed of the typhoon to 110\u00a0mph (175\u00a0km/h; 95\u00a0kn). Although no eye was visible on satellite imagery, radar imagery indicated that an eye was present, but cloud-filed; henceforth, the JTWC increased the intensity of Nina to 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph; 100\u00a0kn), equivalent to a weak Category\u00a03 hurricane.[1] According to the JMA, however, Nina never re-intensified.[2] By 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a027, the low and mid level circulations began to decouple, deeply thwarting many JTWC forecasters. During this time, the cyclone posed a serious threat to Southern China and Hong Kong; but instead, Nina veered northward while gradually weakening;[1] by midday on November\u00a027, the JMA had reduced the intensity of Nina to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph; 70\u00a0kn).[2] Early on November\u00a028, an eye once again became visible on satellite imagery. However, no re-intensification occurred. By the afternoon, increased wind shear took toll on the cyclone, causing Nina to become less organized due to deep convection being sheared off to the east-northeast. Thus, the JTWC expected Nina to move into the Luzon Straits and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. After meandering within the South China Sea, Nina turned south, before dissipating on November\u00a029;[1] though, the JMA continued to monitor its remnants until 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a030.[2]",
      "Preparation and impact[edit]": "",
      "Federated States of Micronesia[edit]": "While passing near Truk, which has a population of 42,000,[7] Typhoon Nina inflicted heavy crop damage on the area.[7] In the capital of Weno, 85% of homes and 50%\u00a0of government buildings were damaged.[8] There, communication lines were downed[9] and hundreds of people were evacuated.[7] Throughout the atoll, four people died,[9] including a woman and a 14-year-old boy killed by a falling breadfruit tree and an 11-year-old girl died after her leg was struck by a piece of flying metal.[7] One person was reported missing. Over 1,000\u00a0people were rendered homeless[10] while roughly 1,000\u00a0homes were damaged.[11] Damaged from the storm ranged from $30\u201340\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD) and 39\u00a0were wounded.[12]",
      "Philippines[edit]": "Prior to landfall, around 10\u00a0provinces,[13] including most of Luzon, was placed under a typhoon alert.[14] However, many fisherman ignored the alerts and refused to flee to higher ground.[15] Furthermore, Philippine Air Lines cancelled 21\u00a0domestic flights and three international flights.[13] Numerous other flights were delayed.[16] Local authorities also suspended school classes.[13] Typhoon Nina brought widespread damage to much of the northern Philippines.[17] It was the strongest system to strike the archipelago since Typhoon Irma in\u00a01981.[17] The capital city of Manila was spared the worst of Nina. There, only minor damage and power outages were reported,[18] though 800\u00a0were evacuated to shelters due to flooding and the city's airport closed.[19] Two men were crushed to death in Lucena City.[13] The worst effects of the storm were felt in Matnog,[20] where 287\u00a0people drowned due to storm surge.[17] In nearby Verla, 61 fatalities occurred,[21] where 98% of the city's buildings were damaged or destroyed and its supply of drinking water was cut off.[22] Throughout the Sorsogon province, 80%\u00a0of all crops were destroyed[23] and 90% of all homes were either damaged or destroyed.[24] Province-wide, 400\u00a0people died.[22] In the Albay province, 73\u00a0people were killed.[25] Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces combined, 80% of all schools and 50%\u00a0of all public buildings were demolished.[22] Elsewhere, seven casualties occurred in the Laguna province, while one person perished each in San Pablo, Batangas, Marinduque and Mindoro Oriental.[22] Thirty-two\u00a0people were killed in the Camarines Sur province and 23\u00a0other people died in Camarines Norte.[26] Five others were killed in the Masbate province,[27] and one died in Marinduque.[28] In Boac, the capital of Marinduque, 80%\u00a0of all dwellings lost their roofs and damage was severe to churches, schools and city buildings.[29] In Bacacay, situated to the southeast of Legaspi, all but 15\u00a0of the town's 200\u00a0dwellings were leveled.[22] Although there were no deaths, Samar Island also suffered severe damage.[30] Offshore, five fisherman perished and a tugboat and cargo ship were rendered missing due to rough seas.[17] Nina also brought widespread power outages to most of Luzon;[31] consequently, trading on the nation's two biggest stock exchange was suspended for November 26.[24] Overall, around 114,000\u00a0persons were evacuated to shelters,[17] 153,339\u00a0were listed homeless,[32] and 1,075 were wounded.[33] A total of 90,173\u00a0homes were demolished due to Nina while an additional 109,633 were partially destroyed.[34] Nationwide, 979\u00a0people were killed.[35] In all, damage from the storm totaled $54.5\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD),[36][nb 3] $7.9\u00a0million of which occurred along the Bicol Region.[33]",
      "Hong Kong and Macau[edit]": "Although Nina was rapidly weakening over the South China Sea, the storm brought 4.7\u00a0mm (0.19\u00a0in) of rain to Hong Kong,[37] prompting a tropical cyclone signal for nearby Macau.[38] Temperatures at the Hong Kong Observatory fell to 9.9\u00b0C, and wind speed was recorded at 53 mph (85 km/h) at Waglan Island.[39][40]",
      "China[edit]": "An intense surge of winter monsoon affected the southern coast of China.[41]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "Due to the damage wrought by Nina, President Corazon Aquino declared four Luzon provinces a disaster area.[17] Initially, only 11 provinces were declared a state of emergency,[42] but by November\u00a029, this total increased to 17.[43] United States Ambassador Nicholas Platt released $25,000\u00a0in emergency aid and sent officials to help with relief efforts.[33] The American Red Cross also provided $24,000\u00a0worth of aid to post-storm victims.[22] The Roman Catholic Church also provided $160,000 worth of food to the nation.[44] Additionally, Social Welfare and Development Secretary Mita Pardo de Tavera donated $50,000\u00a0for emergency disaster relief,[42] though many locals complained that this aid was too little and too late.[22] Around 11,000\u00a0lb (5,000\u00a0kg) of rice was donated for use in eight provinces,[22] and on December\u00a01, an additional 35,000\u00a0lb (16,000\u00a0kg) of aid was airlifted to the region.[45] Belgium also launched a four-month program to help 380,000\u00a0post-storm victims.[34] Most flights in and out of Manila had returned to a normal schedule by November\u00a028.[25] In all, nine countries and several foreign Red Cross organizations responded by providing aid, totaling roughly $700,000\u00a0worth of value, mostly from Japan.[34] PAGASA later retired the name Sisang on the list of tropical cyclones in the country; it was replaced by Sendang.[46]",

      "Cyclone Laurence": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Laurence of December 2009 was the first Category 5 tropical cyclone to make landfall in Australia since Cyclone George in 2007.",
      "Meteorological history": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Laurence was first identified by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) on 8 December 2009 over the Arafura Sea.[1] As the system moved west north of the Top End on 10 December, TCWC Darwin issued a Tropical Cyclone Watch for coastal areas from Croker Island to Bathurst Island but excluding Darwin.[2] Later that day, TCWC Perth cancelled all previous warnings and issued new watches for Kalumburu, south to Wyndham and west to Mitchell Plateau.[3] The system hovered in the same general region for a day, before strengthening into a category one cyclone, and was named by the TCWC Darwin as Tropical Cyclone Laurence. During the morning of 15 December, the cyclone strengthened into a category 2 cyclone before strengthening further into a category 3 system.[4] In the early hours of 16 December Severe TC Laurence was upgraded to a strong category 4 with an eye starting to develop; later developing into a category 5 system.[5] The cyclone crossed the Kimberley coast southeast of Cockatoo Island on 16 December and Derby was in the projected path.[6] On 17 December the cyclone weakened as it meandered over land dumping heavy rain over northern Kimberley. The cyclone's track during the day veered south-west and re-intensification was likely by 18 December as it moved over warm waters.[7] On 19 December, the storm re-intensified into a category one cyclone and began moving slowly southwest, and further intensified into a category 2 the same day.[8] On 20 December it intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, and showed signs of further intensification.[8] On 21 December, the cyclone rapidly intensified into a category 4, and then 5 by the afternoon. The cyclone made landfall on the Western Australia coast near Eighty Mile Beach as a category 5 storm with significant damage to structures reported, although no injuries have been reported. Telephone services to the affected area were disrupted.[9] Overnight, the system began moving inland and rapidly picking up speed, while gradually weakening into a category 3 tropical cyclone.[9] By early 23 December, the cyclone had weakened to Category 1 intensity, but not before inundating eastern Pilbara region with rain and flash flooding.[10] Laurence accelerated even further, and was expected to cause gale-force winds and flooding rain as far as South Australia.[8]",
      "Preparations and impact": "As a tropical low, the precursor to Laurence produced 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) of rain in Darwin, Northern Territory in a 24-hour span.[11] One person was seriously injured after falling off a roof in the Kimberley, Western Australia.[12] After making its final landfall along the Pilbara coastline as a Category 5 cyclone, Laurence wrought severe damage. Numerous trees were uprooted by wind gusts reaching 295\u00a0km/h (183\u00a0mph) and several homes sustained substantial damage. Rainfall in the region was estimated to have exceeded 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in). Power and phone service to most of the Pilbara was lost during the storm and several residents sought shelter in public buildings.[13] Although no people were killed by the storm, hundreds of livestock were feared to have been killed in the affected region.[14] Heavy rain and gale-force winds associated with the cyclone forced the closure of Newcrest Mining Ltd's Telfer gold mine for a day as all non-essential workers were flown from the site.[10] New South Wales' river systems were put on flood alert as rain fell widely. Systems affected were: The name Laurence was retired. It was replaced with Lincoln.[citation needed] Damage from the storm amounted to A$10\u00a0million (US$9\u00a0million).[16]",

      "Tropical Storm Vicente (2018)": " Tropical Storm Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone that made landfall as a tropical depression in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n on October 23, 2018, causing deadly mudslides. The 21st named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Vicente originated from a tropical wave that departed from Africa's western coast on October 6. The wave traveled westward across the Atlantic and entered the Eastern Pacific on October 17. The disturbance became better defined over the next couple of days, forming into a tropical depression early on October 19. Located in an environment favorable for further development, the system organized into Tropical Storm Vicente later that day. The small cyclone traveled northwestward along the Guatemalan coast before later shifting to a more westerly track. Vicente peaked late on October 20 with winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,002\u00a0mbar (29.59\u00a0inHg). At its peak, Vicente displayed a sporadic eye feature in its central dense overcast. The storm maintained this intensity for about eighteen hours as it turned towards the southwest. Dry air caused Vicente to weaken on October 21. A brief break from the dry air during the next day allowed the storm to recuperate and slightly strengthen. However, outflow from the nearby Hurricane Willa caused Vicente to weaken into a tropical depression early on October 23. After making landfall near Playa Azul at 13:30 UTC, Vicente quickly lost organization and dissipated a few hours later. Vicente caused torrential rainfall in the Mexican states of Michoac\u00e1n, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Guerrero, and Colima; the highest total exceeded 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) in Oaxaca. In some states, the effects of Vicente compounded those from the nearby Hurricane Willa. The storm left a total of 16 people dead throughout 2 states: 13 in Oaxaca and 3 in Veracruz. The heavy rainfall caused numerous rivers to spill their banks, dozens of landslides to occur, and severe flooding to ensue elsewhere. This resulted in hundreds of homes being inundated, dozens of road closures, and agricultural damage amongst an array of other effects. Plan DN-III-E was activated in multiple states to provide aid to affected individuals. The federal and state governments mobilized to help with relief efforts and repairs.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Tropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex associated with the eastern Pacific monsoon trough and a tropical wave. The wave departed from Africa's western coast on October 6 and traveled westward across the Atlantic Ocean, arriving at the Lesser Antilles around October\u00a014. Although convection or thunderstorm activity initially flared along the northern side of the wave, it gradually decreased until the wave was completely devoid of convection. The wave came into contact with Central America on October\u00a016; deep convection re-ignited along the monsoon trough and wave south of Panama a day later. Bursts of convection occurred to the south of Nicaragua and El Salvador as the wave proceeded westward into the Eastern Pacific.[1] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned that the system had the potential for tropical development early on October\u00a019. The system was part of a broader disturbance which stretched from Central America to the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.[2] Over the next several hours the system rapidly organized, becoming a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC, while located about 90\u00a0mi (150\u00a0km) west-southwest of Puerto San Jose, Guatemala. The depression's development was not anticipated due to its small size and the close proximity of a larger disturbance to the west (which later become Hurricane Willa).[1] The nascent depression was located in an environment of low wind shear and warm 82\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures, both conducive for further intensification.[3] The structure of the unusually small storm continued to improve, with satellite and microwave imagery showing an increase in banding features around the center. The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Vicente around 18:00\u00a0UTC. Throughout the majority of October\u00a019, the system was less than 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) off the coast of Guatemala while it inched towards the northwest.[1] Early on October\u00a020, increasing northwesterly wind shear disrupted Vicente, causing the degradation of its central dense overcast. At the same time, its low-level center had accelerated towards the northwest and was almost entirely exposed.[4] A deep-layer ridge located over the Gulf of Mexico and central Mexico, as well as a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind, caused Vicente's track to shift to the west during the overnight.[1] The tiny tropical cyclone's structure improved over the next several hours, with the storm displaying a sporadic eye feature surrounded by medium to weak convection.[5] Vicente peaked at 18:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020 with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,002\u00a0mbar (29.59\u00a0inHg). At that time, the storm was located less than 115\u00a0mi (185\u00a0km) off the coast of Chiapas and Oaxaca, Mexico. Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone, with 45\u201350\u00a0mph (70\u201380\u00a0km/h) winds extending only 25\u00a0mi (35\u00a0km) from its center. The system maintained its peak intensity for approximately 18\u00a0hours as it began traveling towards the west-southwest.[1][6] Dry air began to entrain into the mid-levels of the system on October\u00a021, causing convection to weaken and the low-level center to become uncovered once more.[1][7] The storm turned to the west-northwest early on October 22 as it rounded the southwestern edge of the aforementioned ridge. The structure of Vicente markedly improved while it experienced a brief reprieve from the onslaught of the dry air; a banding feature with cold cloud tops of \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C) developed and wrapped around a majority of the storm.[1][8] Later in the day, Vicente began to be affected by the outflow of Hurricane Willa, which was located to the northwest. This outflow imparted northeasterly shear upon Vicente, causing rapid degradation of the system's structure. Banding features decreased significantly and only limited convection remained, displaced to the south and east of Vicente's center.[1][9] Vicente weakened into a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a023 and made landfall near Playa Azul, Michoac\u00e1n, at 13:30\u00a0UTC. After moving ashore, Vicente quickly lost its convection and dissipated by 18:00 UTC.[1][10]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Despite Vicente's close proximity to land, no tropical storm watches or warnings were issued for Guatemala and Mexico.[1] An overall green alert, signifying a low level of danger, was issued for southwestern coast of Mexico.[11] The threats posed by both Vicente and Hurricane Willa forced the Norwegian Bliss cruise ship to divert to San Diego, California.[12] Vicente caused torrential rainfall in multiple states. Peak rainfall of at least 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) occurred in the state of Oaxaca. Rainfall totals of 6.21\u00a0in (157.7\u00a0mm) and 5.31\u00a0in (134.8\u00a0mm) were recorded in Zihuatanejo, Guerrero. In the same state, 4.63\u00a0in (117.5\u00a0mm) of rain fell in San Jer\u00f3nimo. Rainfall exceeding 5.9\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) registered in the state of Colima.[13]",
      "Michoac\u00e1n[edit]": "Vicente made landfall near Playa Azul, Michoac\u00e1n, at 13:30\u00a0UTC (08:30\u00a0CDT) on October\u00a023.[1] Schools along the coast of Michoac\u00e1n were closed to safeguard everyone from the effects of Vicente and Willa.[14] Rainfall from the storm flooded 27 neighborhoods in the city of Morelia.[15] Ventura Puente, Carlos Salazar, Jacarandas, Los Manantiales, and Industrial experienced flooding up to 3.3\u00a0ft (1\u00a0m) deep, which left hundreds of homes inundated.[16] Residents were evacuated from the Jacarandas neighborhood by state officials and police officers after rainfall caused a gasoline leak to occur.[17] Five schools were closed in the city due to flooding and another for mud removal and disinfection work.[18] The Rio Grande overflowed, and drainage systems were completely filled throughout the Morelia municipality. The heavy rainfall also caused the ground to give way near Atapaneo, resulting in a freight train derailment that left two workers injured.[16][19] Plan DN-III-E, a disaster relief and rescue plan, was activated in the municipality; 500 individuals from the Police Training Institute were dispatched to help those affected by the flooding.[17]",
      "Oaxaca[edit]": "The system brought heavy rainfall to Oaxaca, causing widespread flooding and mudslides.[20] Torrential rainfall filled four Oaxacan dams to their highest levels in over four years; two of the dams exceeded 90% of their capacity and another exceeded 100%.[21] The floods left 21\u00a0communities without any outside communication.[22] Roads in Oaxaca suffered severe damage in 203 sections; machinery was apportioned to clear landslides off roads.[23][24][25] At least 13\u00a0people died throughout the state, 6 of whom died in a landslide in San Pedro Ocotepec.[20] A family of four went missing after trying to leave one of the communities.[26][20] Rescue searches for the individuals ceased a week later; they were assumed to have been buried by a landslide.[27] A landslide in Santiago Camotl\u00e1n buried a house and killed a 40-year-old man. In Tututepec, a 56-year-old man drowned after getting caught in river currents.[28] Multiple rivers in the state overtopped their banks and inundated nearby communities. A landslide in Santiago Choapam destroyed three homes.[29] A drainage ditch emptying into the Chahu\u00e9 Bay overflowed, flooding at least 80 homes and businesses;[30] a portion of the ditch also collapsed.[31] Rainfall caused a sinkhole to develop on a bridge. A total of five cars were swept away by water currents flowing down streets in Santa Cruz Huatulco.[31] As a result of the flooding, a temporary shelter was enabled in that area.[32] National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples facilities were activated to help 30 people who were affected. The ports of Puerto \u00c1ngel, Puerto Escondido, and Huatulco were closed.[30][33] Several communities in the Sierra Norte region were isolated and left without any outside communication by landslides and damaged bridges.[34][35] Crops in that area were destroyed by the storm, leading to food shortages.[36] Vicente damaged schools, health care facilities, houses, and crops in the Sierra Mazateca area.[37] In La Humedad, Federal Highway 200 was flooded for over 0.62\u00a0mi (1\u00a0km) and covered by landslides. A fence collapsed and several homes were inundated by floodwaters in Santiago Jamiltepec. Five families were evacuated from their homes in Piedra Ancha due to flooding.[38] Emergency declarations were issued for 167\u00a0municipalities that were severely affected.[39] The Mexican Army and Navy alongside State Police deployed 10,000\u00a0personnel to assist in recovery efforts.[22] Plan DN-III-E was activated to disperse aid to the state; a Mexican Air Force helicopter was utilized to get food and supplies to people in affected areas.[40] A disaster declaration was issued for 71 Oaxacan municipalities affected by Vicente; these areas would have access to national disaster relief funds.[41]",
      "Veracruz[edit]": "Rainfall from the storm triggered flooding in Veracruz, leaving three people dead.[42] A declaration of emergency was issued for 13 municipalities in Veracruz.[43] The World Heritage city of Tlacotalpan prepared for the overflow of the Papaloapan river by creating levees to prevent floodwaters from affecting historical and cultural sites. Multiple landslides were reported on the Zomgolia-Orizaba highway.[44] In the southern portion of the state, the Veracruz-Coatzacoalcos highway was blocked by floodwaters after the Tesochoac\u00e1n river overflowed.[45] Throughout the state, 21 landslides occurred, and 42 roads and 36 schools sustained damage.[46] In the municipality of \u00c1lamo-Temapache, the Oro Verde stream and the Pantepec river overflowed, flooding multiple streets. Plan DN-III-E was enabled to aid with relief in the state.[28][47] The San Juan river spilled its banks, completely blocking the Tinaja-Cosoleacaque highway, a road that connects other states to Veracruz. Federal Police stopped cars from crossing a section of the Cosamaloapan-Acayucan highway after the same river left 5.0\u00a0mi (8\u00a0km) of the road completely submerged under water. Additionally, 1,764 people were evacuated, 15 temporary shelters were activated, and 8 people were rescued throughout the state.[48] Several communities were inundated in Hidalgotitl\u00e1n after the Coatzacoalcos river overflowed; 790 homes were flooded in the towns of Ramos Mill\u00e1n and Vicente Guerrero. Shelters were set up for affected families and 500 pantries distributed water. Classes in the area were canceled as a result of the floods.[49] Twenty-one emergency declarations were authorized for municipalities in the state.[46][47]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "A total of ten landslides occurred in the state of Hidalgo as a result of heavy rainfall from Vicente and the nearby Willa. In the municipalities of the Huasteca and Sierra Alta regions, highway accesses were blocked by boulders and tree limbs. Two people were hospitalized due to a landslide in Zacualtip\u00e1n. Seven people were evacuated after a house was buried in Calnali.[50] Roads in Huehuetla and Tenango del Valle were impassable due to landslides. Landslides affected the Tlanchinol-Hueyapa state highway in Tepehuac\u00e1n de Guerrero, the Pachuca-Huejutla highway in the Mineral del Chico municipality, and on the Mexico City-Tampico federal highway.[51] The rains also filled several dams and reservoirs in the state to over 90% of their capacity, however, there was no risk of failure as a result of active spillways.[52] Due to the unsettled weather produced by Vicente and the nearby Willa, numerous oil tankers were unable to unload fuel at ports in Manzanillo, Colima, and Tuxpan, Veracruz. Combined with the closure of a major pipeline that transports petroleum to Guadalajara, this caused a fuel shortage in Jalisco, with some 500 gas stations being affected.[53] Damage to gasoline distribution centers in Manzanillo and Tuxpan as well as a refinery in Salamanca, Guanajuato, led to shortages in Jalisco, Nayarit, and Colima.[54] Heavy rainfall from Vicente and Willa caused a total of 24 landslides on highways in Jalisco, with about half occurring on El Tuito-Melaque-Cabo Corrientes section of Federal Highway 200.[55] Agricultural losses in the state of Colima from Vicente and Willa were estimated to be about MX$136 million (US$7.05 million).[56] The state of Guerrero also experienced the effects of Vicente. One home flooded in Tixtla and another in Tecpan; the latter's roof also collapsed. Mudslides were reported on two roads in the state. The state government activated over 500 shelters with enough capacity to house 100,000 people. The Tesechoac\u00e1n, Papaloapan, and San Juan rivers began to overflow from heavy rainfall.[57] The storm felled 16 trees in Zihuatanejo; sewers were congested with garbage, leading to street flooding in multiple places throughout the city.[58]",

      "Cyclone Giri": "Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Giri (IMD designation: BOB 04, JTWC designation 04B, also known as Cyclone Giri) was a powerful tropical cyclone in terms of 1-minute sustained wind speed which caused catastrophic damage in parts of Myanmar in late October 2010. Originating from an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on October\u00a019, the system began as a weak depression 250\u00a0km (155\u00a0mi) south of Myanmar. Over the following few days, the depression underwent explosive intensification, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph 3-minute sustained) on October\u00a022. Cyclone Giri made landfall roughly 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) northwest of Kyaukpyu, shortly after peaking. Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened. By the following day, Giri had degenerated into a tropical depression and the final advisory was issued on the storm. Unlike during Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the Government of Myanmar took steps to ensure the safety of residents in the path of Cyclone Giri. An estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm. Throughout central Myanmar, at least 157 people are known to have been killed by Giri. Thousands of structures near where the storm made landfall were destroyed, leaving more than 70,000 people homeless. An international relief effort began shortly after the storm passed to assist survivors of the storm. Local and foreign media initially criticized the Myanmar government for not giving residents enough warning of the storm and then for keeping quiet on the situation, but the focus later shifted to the loss of life and relief efforts.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Cyclone Giri was first identified by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) as an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on October\u00a019. Early on October\u00a020, the system was classified as a depression and given the name BOB 04; and at that time, the system was situated roughly 250\u00a0km (155\u00a0mi) southwest of Sittwe, Myanmar.[1] Continued development took place as convection consolidated around the system and banding features formed along the western side of the low. As the depression was situated in an area of weak wind shear, further development was anticipated over the following days.[2] Early on October\u00a021, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression and expected it to further intensify into a cyclonic storm within 24\u00a0hours.[3] Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the depression, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 04B. The system rapidly developed throughout the day on October\u00a021, developing an eye embedded within deep convection. In response to a near-equatorial ridge to the south, the system slowly tracked towards the northeast, placing Myanmar within its path.[4] Around 0600\u00a0UTC, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm, assigning it the name \"Giri\".[5] Tracking over an area of high sea surface temperatures, rapid intensification ensued during the latter half of October\u00a021.[6] Following the development of very intense convection, with estimated cloud top temperatures between \u221270 and \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221294 and \u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F), Giri strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm, having sustained winds of at least 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph 3-minute sustained).[7] Around 1800\u00a0UTC, the JTWC estimated that the system intensified into a Category\u00a01 equivalent cyclone on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[8] Early on October\u00a022, Giri further strengthened into a very severe cyclonic storm as it slowly moved towards the central coast of Myanmar.[9] Throughout the day, the storm underwent explosive deepening, attaining winds of 240\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained) by 0900\u00a0UTC. Satellite imagery depicted a well-defined 46\u00a0km (29\u00a0mi) wide eye surrounded by deep convection. Accompanied by strong poleward outflow, additional strengthening took place despite Giri's proximity to land.[10] In the hours before landfall on October\u00a022, Giri attained its peak intensity with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph 3-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05\u00a0inHg).[11] However, the JTWC estimated that Giri was a substantially stronger storm, nearly attaining Category\u00a05 status; peak winds were believed to have reached 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained) along with an estimated pressure of 922 mbar (hPa; 27.23\u00a0inHg).[12] Around 1400\u00a0UTC, Cyclone Giri made landfall near Hunter's Bay, roughly 50\u00a0km (31\u00a0mi) northwest of Kyaukpyu at peak intensity.[13] Upon doing so, Giri became the most intense storm to ever strike Myanmar, surpassing Cyclone Nargis which struck the Irrawaddy Delta region as a low-end Category\u00a04 equivalent in May 2008.[14] However, according to the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies, substantial weakening had taken place within the hours before landfall; they estimated that Cyclone Giri struck the coastline with winds of 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph 1-minute sustained).[15] Once overland, the cyclone rapidly decayed as convection dissipated.[16] By early October\u00a023, only scattered bursts of convection remained around the center of Giri as it degenerated into a tropical depression.[17] The final advisory from the IMD was issued later that day as the system weakened further.[18]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Shortly after Giri was classified a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of Myanmar. Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, this was because forecasters did not anticipate Giri to strengthen as quickly as it did.[19] The greatest fear of the residents was the aftermath of the storm. There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta.[20] The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, authorities used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri.[21] According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.[22] Even though the storm wasn't expected to hit Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department issued storm signal five, \"danger level\", at ports of Cox's Bazar and Chittagong.[23] Ships and vessels were also asked to return to shore quickly.[24] On October\u00a023, the warning signals were lowered as the threat from Giri diminished.[25]",
      "Impact[edit]": "According to local media, Cyclone Giri brought a storm surge up to 3.7\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft), along with waves up to 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) and winds in excess of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[26] In Kyaukphyu, much of the city was left more than 1.2\u00a0m (3.9\u00a0ft) under water by the storm. Residents stated that most of Kyaukphyu was destroyed by Giri, with nearly every tree and lamppost felled and all structures damaged or destroyed.[27] Later reports confirmed that roughly 70% of the city had been destroyed by Giri.[28] In the Ashey Paing ward, an entire village was flattened by the storm as roughly 1,000 homes were destroyed. Near the Gangawtaw Pagoda in Kyaukphyu, nearly 100 homes were completely destroyed.[27] The local Red Cross office in the city was also destroyed after a large tree fell on it due to high winds.[29] Myebon Township was the hardest-hit area in the country: several villages were completely destroyed by the storm and many others were severely damaged.[30] According to the United Nations, roughly 15,000 homes were destroyed by the storm throughout Rakhine State.[31] In the Seikphyu Township, flood waters up to 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) deep inundated 20 villages after overflow from a dam was released without warning. Of the few reports coming from the region, there were indications of fatalities in outlying villages. Most of the livestock in the area perished as there was no time to bring them to higher ground safely.[32] The overall timing of the cyclone's landfall was also devastating for the region. It came at the only harvest of the year for Rakhine State. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 16,187\u00a0hectares (40,000\u00a0acres) of rice paddies were destroyed and another 40,468\u00a0hectares (100,000\u00a0acres) were damaged.[33] Within a day of Giri striking Myanmar, three people were reported to have been killed by the storm and tens of thousands of residents were believed to have been left homeless.[27] By October\u00a025, officials in Myanmar stated that the death toll had risen to 50 and at least 30 people in the Pyin Wan Village were missing. Press reports stated that \"The situation here is alarming\", as more bodies were discovered.[34] Offshore, more than 100 fishermen from Myanmar and Bangladesh were reported missing after 21 ships were caught in rough seas produced by the cyclone.[26] By October\u00a029, at least 94 people were confirmed to have been killed by Giri. Of these fatalities, 84 were in Myebon Township (Mray Bon) and 10 in Pauktaw Township.[35][36] However, according to local relief groups, the death toll had risen over 100.[31] By November\u00a02, 157 fatalities had been confirmed as a result of Cyclone Giri. Of these fatalities, 138 were in Myebon Township, 11 in Pauktaw Township, 5 in Minbya Township and 3 in Kyaukpyu Township.[37] According to officials in Kyaukpyu Township, damage from the storm amounted to Ks.2.34\u00a0billion (US$359\u00a0million).[38]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "Immediately following the storm, urgent requests for food and clean water were made by residents in the hardest hit areas. By the afternoon of October\u00a023, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu where at least 5,000 people were left homeless.[39] According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless.[40] By October\u00a030, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1\u00a0million and roughly 100,000 respectively.[41][42] Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar.[29] Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of Ks.10\u00a0million ($10,000\u00a0USD).[43] By October\u00a025, temporary shelter camps set up by relief agencies housed an estimated 5,000 people.[44] By October\u00a026, the Government of the Union of Myanmar had begun distributing 60,000 zinc roof sheets and the Ministry of Forestry provided 200\u00a0tonnes (220\u00a0tons) of timber. Through the end of October, six non-governmental organizations in Myanmar planned to distribute emergency food supplies, such rice, oil, salt and pulses, to 5,000 residents in Kyaukpyu and Myebon. Health supplies were also being distributed at relief camps by UNICEF in the hardest-hit areas. About 500 family kits containing non-food items, such as tarpaulins and mosquito nets, had been distributed by the Myanmar Red Cross Society and another 1,200 were being sent to the area.[40] By the start of November, the government of Myanmar requested medial aid from the United Nations as a cholera outbreak began to unfold. Additional post-storm diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, eye infections and skin diseases became prevalent as well. According to locals, at least six people died as a result of cholera.[45] At least 200 people were infected with dysentery and four were killed by the disease in the towns of Kyaukphyu, Minbya and Myebon. The cause of the outbreak was linked to a lack of clean water.[46]",
      "International assistance[edit]": "On October\u00a026, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the country would provide emergency assistance and aid to Myanmar.[47] Roughly a week after the passage of Cyclone Giri, the government of Australia pledged about US$200,000 to victims of the storm. The governments of Britain and Japan also pledged to donate US$700,000 and US$500,000 respectively to Myanmar.[48] The World Food Programme sent 900\u00a0tonnes (992\u00a0tons) of rice with another 300\u00a0tonnes (330\u00a0tons) on the way; stocks of rice in Kyaukpyu itself had reportedly been exhausted.[40] By late-November, the World Food Programme had allocated US$2.8\u00a0million in relief funds.[48] Roughly 1,500 households in Kyaukpyu township were being cared for by Save the Children.[40] Through the United Nations, organizations pledged to provide a total of US$54\u00a0million in aid. In late-November, the United States provided an additional US$3\u00a0million in relief funds.[48]",
      "Criticism of the Junta[edit]": "International and local media criticized the military government for inadequate warnings prior to Giri's landfall in the country. However, the junta claims to have informed the public appropriately.[44] Little assistance had reached thousands of survivors days after the storm's passage, fueling anger from local media sources. Government relief slowly reached the area; however, workers only cleared debris left by the storm and only encouraged residents to rebuild by giving them the supplies needed to do so.[28] Further criticism was made about the government withholding information on the loss of life and scale of damage.[49] Requests were also made to postpone a national election for residents in Arakan State;[31] however, no response was given and the elections were still planned to be held on November\u00a07.[41] Additional criticism continued even a week after the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need.[31] Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by the Junta. The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing what was going on in the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region.[50] On November\u00a08, local media discovered that the junta was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, the Junta had complete victories.[51]",

      "Tropical Storm Laura (2008)": "Tropical Storm Laura was a large but short-lived tropical cyclone that developed over the north-central Atlantic Ocean in late September during the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Laura's remnants later impacted the Netherlands, Germany, and Norway. The 12th named storm of the season, Laura formed out of a large extratropical area of low pressure located about 1,015 miles (1,633\u00a0km) west of the Azores on September\u00a029. Laura slowly developed tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters. On the afternoon of September\u00a030, Laura had acquired enough tropical characteristics to be designated a tropical storm. Shortly after being declared tropical, Laura began to undergo an extratropical transition, which did not fully take place until the morning of October\u00a01. Laura degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning, and the final advisory by the National Hurricane Center was issued. The remnants of Laura contributed to heavy rainfall and power outages in the British Isles, the Netherlands, and Norway on October\u00a05 to 8.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On September\u00a026, a very large extratropical area of low pressure developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a027. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction.[1] By September\u00a029, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura.[2] Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying.[3] A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.[4] During the afternoon, satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature.[5] By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still under the influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow.[6] However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September\u00a030, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical.[7] Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude,[8] 40.6\u00b0N.[1] Laura peaked as a tropical cyclone, attaining maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 994 millibars (29.4\u00a0inHg).[1] Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.[9] Overnight, convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status.[10] Early on October\u00a01, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system.[11] With minimal shower and thunderstorm activity remaining around the center of Laura, the storm degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area on October\u00a01 while still producing tropical storm-force winds. The next day, the remnant system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and began to re-intensify as it rapidly tracked towards the north. Early on October\u00a03, the system slowed down as it turned towards the east and strengthened into a hurricane-force cyclone, with winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 990 millibars (29\u00a0inHg), reaching its extratropical peak. After accelerating towards the east, another large extratropical cyclone absorbed the remnants of Laura while located several hundred miles west of the British Isles on October\u00a04.[1]",
      "Impact[edit]": "As a tropical cyclone, Laura never approached land, and no damages or fatalities occurred. Since the storm remained over open waters for most of its life, several ships and oil platforms recorded tropical storm-force winds. The highest recorded winds were at an oil platform with the call sign VEP717 at 03:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a01. Winds were recorded up to 47 knots (54\u00a0mph; 87\u00a0km/h).[1] Despite the lack of impact, the storm's remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and steered towards Europe.[22] There, they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of Britain on October\u00a05, causing localized accumulation of flood waters. As a result, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously saturated soil, combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions.[23] One person had to be rescued from her car after driving into a flooded street. The UK Environment Agency issued 76 flood watches and 21 severe flood warnings as a result of the rainfall.[24] On October\u00a08, the remnants of Laura reached the Netherlands. At the time, its rain bands began interacting with a cold front associated with a well-developed low west of Norway,[25] dropping up to 113\u00a0mm (4.4\u00a0in)[26] of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands. Consequently, streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef were reportedly inundated. The large amounts of precipitation broke the daily and monthly rainfall records for October, which were previously set in 2006.[27] Gradually passing through Norway, the remnants of the storm caused significant damage to electric utilities. As a result, more than 10,000 people lost power in southern parts of the country.[28]",

      "Cyclone Debbie": "  Severe Tropical Cyclone Debbie in 2017 was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Queensland since Marcia in 2015, and was the costliest tropical cyclone in Australia since Yasi in 2011. Forming as a tropical low on 23 March, the low gradually intensified into a named tropical cyclone on 25 March. After steadily strengthening offshore to a Category 4 system, Debbie eventually made landfall near Airlie Beach, at 12:40 AEST on 28 March.[1] Afterwards, Debbie rapidly weakened into a tropical low by late 28 March, but continued to travel south, causing significant damage and flooding in the populous areas of South East Queensland and Northern Rivers.[1] In total, the storm caused A$3.5\u00a0billion (US$2.67\u00a0billion) in damage and fourteen deaths across Australia, primarily as a result of extreme flooding. This makes Debbie the deadliest cyclone to hit Australia since Fifi in 1991.[2]",
      "Meteorological history": "On 22 March 2017, a well-defined but weak area of low pressure developed over the Coral Sea, near the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. Strong wind shear aloft kept the accompanying convection poorly organised and displaced west of the surface circulation.[3] With environmental conditions forecast to improve and favour cyclogenesis, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Brisbane classified the system as a tropical low on 23 March.[4] Throughout the following day, decreasing shear enabled convection to wrap around the low;[5] however, convective activity remained largely transient. A mid-level ridge to the east and an approaching trough over the Tasman Sea steered the low generally south.[6] High sea surface temperatures of 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F) and excellent dual-channel outflow fuelled rapid consolidation on 24 March. This prompted the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, indicating the system was likely to acquire gale-force winds within 24\u00a0hours.[7] A scatterometer pass at 11:56\u00a0UTC revealed surface winds of up to 75\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph) and subsequent satellite intensity estimates supported gale-intensity, and the JTWC accordingly classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 13P by 21:00\u00a0UTC. With exceptionally favourable environmental conditions ahead of the storm, the agency noted a high probability for rapid deepening before landfall in Queensland.[8] The BOM followed suit soon thereafter, classifying the system as a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale at 00:00\u00a0UTC on 25 March. Concurrently, they assigned it the name Debbie.[9] The cyclone continued to track generally southwards, developing into a Category 2 cyclone later that day. After attaining that strength, Debbie assumed a generally southwestwards track\u2014a track it would maintain, with minor fluctuations, until about 14 hours after landfall.[1] After a day-long period of arrested development, environmental conditions became highly favourable for renewed intensification. Beginning early on 27 March, Debbie strengthened rapidly from Category 2 to a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone in just 12 hours, and achieving peak sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 949\u00a0hPa (28.02\u00a0inHg).[1] After that, the Dvorak intensity given that the storm weakened slightly. Debbie passed over the Whitsunday Islands in the morning of 28 March local time with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (103\u00a0mph), still at Category 4 intensity. Nonetheless, the cyclone weakened to Category 3 before making landfall in Airlie Beach at 02:40 UTC with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[1][10] Following landfall, Debbie began to weaken steadily while interacting with North Queensland's rugged terrain. The cyclone weakened below severe tropical cyclone status while passing Collinsville at 12:00 UTC on 28 March.[1] The system was downgraded to Category 1 in the early hours of 29 March local time, and then weakened further to a tropical low six few hours afterwards.[1] The tropical low then executed a long turn to the southeast, and proceeded towards South East Queensland, moving roughly parallel to the coast.[1] The remnants of Debbie brought heavy rainfall\u2014torrential rains in many areas\u2014that resulted in flooding in large parts of the land areas across which it tracked, before moving out over the Pacific Ocean on Friday 31 March.[1]",
      "Preparations": "Major storm surge was seen as one of the most dangerous factors associated with the approaching cyclone. With the storm potentially coinciding with high tide, it was estimated that water rise in some areas could potentially exceed 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft).[11] Residents in low-lying areas across Bowen, Proserpine and Airlie Beach were ordered to evacuate their homes. Late on 27 March, just over 12 hours prior to landfall, 25,000 residents in low-lying areas of Mackay were ordered to evacuate.[12] Approximately 5,500\u00a0people in the Bowen area were also urged to leave.[11] Across Queensland, more than 400 schools and education centres were closed.[13] All flights at Townsville Airport, Proserpine/Whitsunday Coast Airport, Mackay Airport, Hamilton Island Airport and Moranbah Airport were cancelled from 27 March,[11] and Queensland Rail suspended train services between Rockhampton and Townsville. North Queensland Bulk Ports closed the ports at Mackay, Abbot Point and Hay Point.[14] A total of 1,000\u00a0emergency personnel and more than 200\u00a0Energex workers were deployed to the region to assist with Ergon Energy's preparations and clean up operations.[15][11] The Australian Defence Force formed Joint Task Force 661, dubbed \"Operation Queensland Assist\", to provide assistance with aeromedical evacuation, search and rescue, road clearance, restoration of essential services, emergency accommodation and the delivery of stores if required.[16] The Royal Australian Navy landing ship HMAS Choules set sail from Sydney to Queensland to support post-storm recovery. Normally, HMAS Canberra and HMAS Adelaide would be deployed; however, propulsion issues with the two vessels kept them docked for repairs.[17] Three MRH-90 helicopters from HMAS Albatross were also deployed to Queensland.[18] The Royal Australian Air Force put transport aircraft on standby at Townsville, RAAF Base Amberley and RAAF Base Darwin.[19] The Australian Defence Force's pre-deployment of resources was the largest in the nation's history in advance of a natural disaster;[13] approximately 1,200\u00a0personnel were deployed.[20]",
      "Media criticism": "There was criticism of the intense coverage of the cyclone by commercial TV media, including some unsafe actions by reporters.[21] Former Deputy Leader of Australian Greens, Adam Bandt, was criticised by the conservative government's Federal Energy Minister for suggesting that construction of new coal plants would cause climate change, and hence increase the intensity of extreme weather events like Cyclone Debbie.[22]",
      "Impact": "",
      "Queensland": "An unexpected turn to the south during the cyclone's final approach to the Queensland coast brought the storm directly on top of Hamilton Island, where no evacuations took place.[23] Damage was reported on the Whitsunday Islands, as strong winds lifted some roofs from houses; on Hamilton Island, sustained winds reached 191\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph) with gusts up to 263\u00a0km/h (163\u00a0mph) around 10:28\u00a0a.m. local time on 28 March.[24][25] Winds in excess of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) battered the island for more than 24\u00a0hours.[26] Power outages affected at least 63,000 properties across Queensland, and numerous trees were uprooted during the storm, with some crashing onto homes. Many animals would have been left to die.[27] Major damage was reported across Bowen, where most homes had been built before stricter building codes were enforced.[28] Approximately 300\u00a0people, primarily tourists, on Daydream Island were left stranded and in dire need of supplies.[27] Attempts were made to evacuate residents from the island; however, ships were unable to dock as the jetty was destroyed.[20] A flock of cockatoos was caught in the storm near Airlie Beach, and many died while clinging to tree branches. One particular bird, later nicknamed Debbie, was found stripped of its feathers by Townsville Bulletin photographer Alix Sweeney and rescued as the cyclone's eye passed through. The story of Debbie became a viral headline.[29] Although seemingly in good spirits once the storm cleared,[30] the bird died during the overnight of 29\u201330 March likely due to internal injuries.[31][32] Inclement weather and evacuations associated with the cyclone were blamed for a fatal car accident near Proserpine on 27 March, where one person died on-scene whilst two others were hospitalised.[33][34] A man in Proserpine also suffered an injury and was hospitalised after a wall collapsed on him on 28 March.[35] Torrential rains\u2014described by the Bureau of Meteorology as \"phenomenal\"[36]\u2014affected large portions of Queensland, particularly in the Pioneer Basin. Forty-eight-hour accumulations in the area exceeded 1,000\u00a0mm (39\u00a0in)\u2014these areas see an average of 1,500 to 2,000\u00a0mm (59 to 79\u00a0in) of rain per year.[20] West of Mackay, the Kinchant and Middle Creek dams overflowed, prompting additional evacuation of residents.[36] Multiple sections of the Bruce Highway between Townsville and Mackay were submerged by floodwaters, prompting its closure.[37] The ex-tropical cyclone went on to cause damage further south, particularly around the Logan and Albert Rivers, flooding infrastructure such as the Beenleigh railway station and resulting in the death of a 77-year-old man in Eagleby.[38] Damage to Queensland's sugar industry is expected to cost A$150\u00a0million (US$114.5\u00a0million). The majority of these costs lie in Proserpine and Mackay. 35% of all sugarcane in the Proserpine region and 20% of all sugarcane in the Mackay region were damaged, costing A$50\u00a0million (US$38.2\u00a0million) and A$81\u00a0million (US$61.8\u00a0million) respectively.[39] Damage to winter crops in the Bowen\u2013Gumlu region reached A$100\u00a0million (US$76.4\u00a0million).[40] Insured losses across Australia reached A$1.65\u00a0billion (US$1.26\u00a0billion), with 73,000 damage claims being filed.[41] Total economic losses reached A$3.5\u00a0billion (US$2.67\u00a0billion).[1] In addition, a total of eight deaths were reported throughout Queensland.[42]",
      "New South Wales": "Ex-Tropical Cyclone Debbie continued to move south and merged with a cold front moving up the north coast of New South Wales.[43] This triggered heavy rainfall in the Northern Rivers and led to significant flooding in the Tweed, Lismore, Byron, Richmond Valley, Kyogle and Ballina local government areas. A woman drowned in floodwaters at a rural property south of Murwillumbah, while the Pacific Motorway was cut off by floodwaters at Chinderah.[44] New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared the regions as disaster zones, thus enabling the residents to access disaster assistance funding.[45] Two more people were confirmed to have drowned in floodwaters on 1 April, another south of Murwillumbah and one at Gungal.[46] On 3 April, a mother and two of her children drowned when their car plunged into the flooded Tweed River at Tumbulgum.[47] In total, Debbie killed six people in New South Wales.[42]",
      "New Zealand": "A week after becoming extratropical, the remnants of Cyclone Debbie passed over New Zealand, causing flash flooding over many areas. The township of Edgecumbe in the Bay of Plenty region was evacuated on April 6 due to flooding, and a state of emergency declared.[48] The insurance claims reached NZ$91.5\u00a0million (US$63.8\u00a0million).[49]",
      "Aftermath": "Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk pledged A$1,000,000 (US$754,205) to assist the Australian Red Cross Society, Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul Society of Queensland, and UnitingCare Community in distributing supplies.[27] Debbie was the only name from the 2016\u20132017 season to be retired by the Bureau of Meteorology, It was replaced by Dara in mid-2018.[50]",

      "Typhoon Fanapi": " Typhoon Fanapi, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Inday, was a damaging and deadly typhoon that struck Taiwan and southeastern China in September 2010. It was the eleventh tropical storm and fourth typhoon of the very inactive season. The storm formed on September\u00a014 east of the Philippines and moved slowly for several days, initially to the northwest, then curving to the northeast before turning westward due to a ridge to the north. During this time, Fanapi intensified to reach 10\u00a0minute maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph). Fanapi made its first landfall on September\u00a019 over Hualien, Taiwan, becoming the first typhoon to hit the island since Typhoon Morakot in August 2009. Later that day made a final landfall in Fujian, China. The storm dissipated on September\u00a021 over southern China. The typhoon first affected southern Japan, bringing rainfall to the outer Miyako Islands. However, impacts were worst in Taiwan and mainland China. In southern Taiwan, Fanapi dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 1,126\u00a0mm (44.3\u00a0in) in Majia, Pingtung. About 150,000\u00a0people evacuated their homes, and there were heightened preparations after the damaging effects of Typhoon Morakot the previous year. The heavy rainfall from Fanapi caused landslides, heavy crop damage, and flooding, notably in the major city of Kaohsiung, where rains totaled 506\u00a0mm (19.9\u00a0in). In some areas of the city, the floods reached over one-story deep, inundating cars and causing about NT$3\u00a0billion (New Taiwan dollar, US$93.75\u00a0million) in industrial damage.[nb 1] There were five deaths in Taiwan during the storm's passage, and damage was estimated at NT$5\u00a0billion (US$158\u00a0million). Later, the threat from Fanapi caused 264,000\u00a0people to evacuate their homes in southeastern China. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region, reaching 640\u00a0mm (25\u00a0in) in Guangdong. Fanapi also caused landslides there, killing 100 people, including 28 in Xinyi due to a collapse at a mine. Also in Guangdong, the storm wrecked 16,000\u00a0homes and flooded 66,400\u00a0ha (164,000 acres) of crop fields. Provincial damage was estimated at \u00a55.15\u00a0billion (CNY, $757.05\u00a0million). The name Fanapi was later retired due to the heavy damage.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted west of Guam on September\u00a013,[1] in association with the monsoon trough.[2] The system gradually developed a low-level circulation and rainbands, aided by low wind shear from an anticyclone aloft.[1] Late on September\u00a014, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] designated the system as a tropical depression to the east of the Philippine island of Luzon.[3] Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] classified the system as Tropical Depression 12W. A nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough limited the depression's outflow to the north, although convection continued to increase. The depression moved northwestward along the southwestern periphery of a ridge.[5] At 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, the Philippine-based PAGASA began warning on the system, giving it the local name Inday.[6] Nine hours later, the JMA named the system Tropical Storm Fanapi.[3] As a strengthening tropical storm, Fanapi developed deeper convection near the center. A passing trough to the north weakened the ridge and caused the storm to slow,[7] turning northeastward by September\u00a016. That day, Fanapi developed an eye feature,[8] becoming a typhoon at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[3] As the ridge built into the East China Sea, the storm responded by turning to the northwest, and at the same time, outflow improved to the north.[9] The eye organized further as it contracted to a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi). By that time, the typhoon was moving due westward toward Taiwan, steered by a ridge over northeastern China. At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, the JTWC estimated that Fanapi attained peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph).[10] Around the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10\u00a0minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph).[3] Early on September\u00a019, Typhoon Fanapi made landfall over eastern Taiwan near Hualien City with winds of 162\u00a0km/h (101\u00a0mph), according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau.[11] The storm subsequently weakened over land,[3] dipping southwestward as convection diminished over the northern portion of the storm.[12] However, the storm resumed its westward trajectory and soon moved over the Taiwan Strait as a severe tropical storm.[3] The thunderstorms reorganized slightly as Fanapi reached open waters, and a nearby ship reported winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[13] Early on September\u00a020, the storm made a second landfall on southeastern China near Fujian and weakened further over land,[3][14] although thunderstorms persisted southeast of the circulation along the coast.[15] Fanapi weakened into a tropical depression later that day and dissipated late on September\u00a021.[3]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "In Taiwan, the threat of Fanapi forced the closure of rail lines and cancellation of flights from Kaohsiung International Airport,[11] and at least 156\u00a0flights were canceled.[16] The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan to close,[17] thus delaying shipments from nearby chemical plants.[18] Many boats rode out the storm at port.[19] Portions of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system suspended their service,[20] and the Maokong Gondola was shut down during the storm.[21] Ahead of the storm, officials issued landslide warnings along 61\u00a0rivers,[22] and residents in landslide-prone areas were ordered to evacuate.[11] About 10,000\u00a0people left their homes in mountainous areas.[23] Hotels were also evacuated, and residents boarded up windows,[11] with schools and businesses closed.[24] Overall, about 150,000\u00a0were evacuated due to the storm,[19] with over 7,500\u00a0people staying in their houses and requiring assistance to leave after the floods.[25] After the damaging impacts of Typhoon Morakot from the year prior, officials enacted enhanced preparations for Fanapi,[19] including activating over 19,000\u00a0emergency workers.[26] Anticipating heavy rainfall, workers at the Tsengwen Reservoir drained waters ahead of the storm.[21] Farmers also rushed to complete harvests,[27] causing a temporary drop in price due to excess supply.[28]  The inaugural Yeangder Tournament Players Championship was reduced to a 54-stroke play due to the Typhoon.[29] The shipping route linking Xiamen, in east China's Fujian Province, and Kinmen (Quemoy), in Taiwan was closed as the typhoon closed in.[30] Chinese officials ordered over 55,000\u00a0fishing boats to return to port in Fujian.[19] In Xiamen province north of where Fanapi moved ashore, all kindergarten through middle schools were closed.[31] Across Fujian province, 186,000\u00a0people evacuated due to the storm. The Fuzhou Changle International Airport in the province's capital city canceled 37\u00a0flights due to the storm.[30] About 78,000\u00a0people in low-lying areas of Guangdong left their houses.[32] Oil futures rose in Asia due to the potential for the storm affecting China's offshore oil platforms.[33] While Fanapi was still over Taiwan, the Hong Kong Observatory issued the Number 1 Standby Warning and later upgraded it to a warning Number 3 for Hong Kong. The storm ultimately passed about 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) north of the territory.[14]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Japan[edit]": "While moving toward Taiwan, Fanapi affected the southernmost islands of Japan, bringing heavy rainfall to Okinawa Prefecture. Ohara recorded 221\u00a0mm (8.7\u00a0in) of precipitation during the storm's passage. High winds were recorded as well, peaking at 158\u00a0km/h (98\u00a0mph) at Taketomi, Okinawa.[34] The storm caused flights to be canceled in the Miyako Islands.[35]",
      "Taiwan[edit]": "By the time Fanapi made landfall, portions of Taiwan reported 300\u00a0mm (12\u00a0in) of rainfall.[11] Overall rainfall peaked at 1,126\u00a0mm (44.3\u00a0in) on the island in Majia, Pingtung.[26] These were the heaviest rainfall totals in 10\u00a0years in some locations.[36] This led to flooding in the southern portion of the island, with flash flooding occurring in Kaohsiung, the island's second largest city.[37] Rainfall rates there reached 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) per hour at one point,[36] totaling 506\u00a0mm (19.9\u00a0in);[38] this was the heaviest in 50\u00a0years.[39] Several reservoirs were filled to capacity across Taiwan.[40] Wind gusts also reached 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph).[37] During the storm, a Mw5.2 earthquake struck eastern Taiwan, although it did not cause any additional injuries.[41] In Kaohsiung, nine of the eleven administrative districts were filled with water.[42] Thousands of homes and vehicles were flooded, reaching over one-story in height.[43] Flooding shut down 10\u00a0petrochemical plants in Kaohsiung,[37] causing NT$3\u00a0billion (New Taiwan dollar, US$93.75\u00a0million) in industrial damage.[44] Also in the city, a nursing home was flooded while residents were inside, forcing firemen and rescuers to evacuate the senior citizens; due to inadequate staffing during the storm, the facility was later shut down.[45] The severe flooding in Kaohsiung resulted from inadequate handling by the sewage system,[46] which was designed to handle 321\u00a0mm (12.6\u00a0in) of daily precipitation.[47] Flood systems were designed to withstand a 1 in 50 year flood, and the deluge from Fanapi was previously estimated to occur only once every 200 years; after the storm, the government began the process of reviewing the standards.[43] High winds broke windows across Taiwan,[18] while also knocking down trees and traffic lights.[19] The storm damaged 438\u00a0schools, mostly affecting colleges and universities.[48] The passage of Fanapi left about 890,000\u00a0homes without power, and another 17,000 without water.[25] Floods also affected 23,470\u00a0ha (58,000 acres) of crop fields, mostly to banana plantations. The storm killed 8,791\u00a0pigs and 533,000\u00a0chickens, and many fish breeding ponds were marred.[49] Agriculture damage was preliminarily estimated at $NT2.12\u00a0billion (US$65.27\u00a0million).[50] The storm forced 25\u00a0roads to be closed, mostly due to debris.[23] The South-Link Line was shut down after a railroad bridge along the Taimali River was washed out.[25] Across Taiwan, 111\u00a0people were injured,[25] mainly due to broken glass, and some were blown off motorcycles by high winds.[23] A girl drowned after slipping into the flooded Taoyuan Canal, and a companion attempting to rescue her died as well. One woman drowned after falling into a swollen river while harvesting her crops.[21] These three deaths were not directly related to the storm.[51] The storm directly killed two people \u2013 one was due to electrocution in Pingtung County, and the other due to drowning in Tainan County.[52] Overall damage in Taiwan were counted at NT$5\u00a0billion (US$158\u00a0million).[53]",
      "China[edit]": "The storm brought heavy rainfall to southern China, with six counties in Fujian Province reporting over 200\u00a0mm (7.9\u00a0in) of precipitation in 23\u00a0hours. Rainfall was the heaviest in a century in some portions of Guangdong.[54][55] Yangchun recorded 548.5\u00a0mm (21.59\u00a0in) in just seven hours, which broke the daily precipitation record set in 1958.[56] Elsewhere in Guangdong, 24\u2011hour rainfall reached over 640\u00a0mm (25\u00a0in).[32] Moving ashore in Fujian, the high winds from Fanapi knocked over trees and billboards.[31] However, damage was heaviest in neighboring Guangdong,[57] where the storm's heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides in the western mountainous regions. The landslides cut off traffic between cities, in conjunction with floodwaters.[58] In Xinyi, a storm-related landslide collapsed a dam at a mine,[56] killing 28\u00a0people,[59] including four people downstream. The collapse also damaged homes and farms while killing over 100\u00a0tons of fish.[60] Damage in the city alone was estimated at \u00a5460\u00a0million (Chinese yuan, US$68.5\u00a0million),[56] with 350\u00a0houses destroyed.[61] The floods forced about 128,000\u00a0people to evacuate in Guangdong,[59] including 18,930\u00a0people in Yangchun.[56] Fanapi wrecked 16,000\u00a0homes and flooded 66,400\u00a0ha (164,000 acres) of crop fields. Throughout Guangdong, Fanapi killed 100 people and provincial damage was counted to be CNY 5.15 billion (US$757.05 million).[62] Total economic losses in Fujian province were counted to be CNY 610 million (US$89.71 million).[63]\nWhile passing north of Hong Kong, Fanapi produced thunderstorms and gale-force winds in Hong Kong,[14] with a peak precipitation of 295.5\u00a0mm (11.63\u00a0in).[64] The rains caused isolated flooding that caused residents in Pok Fu Lam to require rescue. The winds knocked over 47\u00a0trees, some of which damaged vehicles, but otherwise damage was minor in the territory.[14]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "In response to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888\u00a0troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work.[41] Soldiers also set up five medical centers,[25] and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas.[24] Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September\u00a023, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority.[65] More than 100\u00a0buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods.[46] About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September\u00a021.[25] The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans.[36] Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage.[42] Power and water service was restored within days of the storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage.[25] There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods.[66] The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 in the days after the storm.[67] The government announced on September\u00a020 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house.[68] Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.[69] In mainland China, officials used helicopters to airdrop relief goods to Guangdong. By three days after the storm, workers distributed 2,000\u00a0tents and 1,000\u00a0beds.[57] Once the floodwaters dropped, residents returned their homes to clean up the mud and damage. Farm officials in Guangdong used 50\u00a0tons of disinfectant to prevent the spread of disease, while the provincial government allocated \u00a5240\u00a0million (CNY, US$35\u00a0million) for rebuilding.[59] About 1,000\u00a0soldiers worked to clean debris and animal carcasses from the reservoir providing drinking water to Maoming.[39] The collapsed dam in Guangdong was later torn down due to being structurally deficient.[70] Zijin Mining, the owner of the dam, had to sell a mine to pay for compensation and fines related to the incident,[71] which ultimately totaled \u00a5245\u00a0million (CNY, US$38.7\u00a0million).[72] After the storm, the Red Cross Society of China provided \u00a51\u00a0million (CNY, US$148,000) to localities affected hardest by the storm, as well as distributing mosquito nets, water purifiers, food, and clothing.[73]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "The name Fanapi was retired at the 43rd annual meeting of ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in Jeju, South Korea, in January 2011.[74] In February 2012, the committee selected the name Rai to replace Fanapi on the naming lists.[75] It was first used during the 2016 season.",

      "1932 Freeport hurricane": " The 1932 Freeport hurricane was an intense tropical cyclone that primarily affected areas of the Texas coast in August of the 1932 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the second storm and first hurricane of the season, developing just off the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on August 12. While moving to the northwest, the storm began to quickly intensify the next day. It rapidly intensified from a category 1 hurricane to a category 4 with winds estimated at 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and an estimated central pressure of 935\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg) shortly before making landfall near Freeport, Texas, early on August 14. After landfall, the hurricane began to quickly weaken before dissipating over the Texas Panhandle. The storm caused heavy rainfall inland, peaking at 9.93\u00a0in (252\u00a0mm) in Angleton. Record rainfall rates were also reported in some areas. Power outages were reported in Galveston and San Antonio. The storm caused $7.5 million in damages,[nb 1] mostly to crops, and 40\u00a0deaths.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The Freeport hurricane was first noted by ships on August 12 as a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico.[1] However, it was suggested in later research that the disturbance may have originated from a low-pressure area between Belize and Honduras on August 11.[2] Steadily moving to the northwest, the storm began to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 13, and soon after reaching major hurricane strength later that day.[3] A report remarked that the storm was \"phenomenal\" due to the fact that previously the storm had \"seemed to be of only moderate intensity\" while near land before rapidly intensifying.[2] The storm eventually reached winds of 145\u00a0mph (233\u00a0km/h), making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[2] The hurricane proceeded to make landfall early on August 14 just east of Freeport with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[2] A ship just offshore of the coast reported a minimum pressure of 942\u00a0mbar (27.8\u00a0inHg), but the official estimate for the hurricane's landfall intensity was set to 935\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg) given the fact that the system was still rapidly intensifying at the time.[2]  Due to the storm's small size, it quickly weakened to tropical storm strength later that day.[3] The storm finally weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating the next day over the Texas Panhandle.[2]",
      "Preparations, impact, and aftermath[edit]": "In preparation for the storm, 150\u00a0vehicles evacuated out of Freeport, while water craft were taken up the Brazos River as far inland as possible.[5] 100\u00a0families in Caplen and Gilchrist were also evacuated. The 38th division of the Texas National Guard, stationed in Palacios, was alerted due to the oncoming storm.[6] Heavy rainfall occurred across the coast and further inland due to the storm. Four locations set 24-hour rainfall records for the month of August, the highest of which was set near Angleton, recording 9.93\u00a0in (252\u00a0mm) of rain on August\u00a013. Angleton also faced a water shortage after its pumping station was destroyed.[7] The remnants of the storm produced as much as 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) of rain in Oklahoma.[6]\nOccupants in four vehicles were rescued by the United States Coast Guard near San Luis Pass.[5] In Wharton, 800\u00a0birds went missing in the heavy rain.[6] Galveston suffered primarily wind damage in the form of unroofed structures and broken windows. The Galveston Causeway was flooded by the heavy rain, preventing access from Galveston Island to the mainland.[5]  Several other roads were blocked by fallen trees.[8] \nThe city was also affected by a power outage after the storm caused loss of power and damaged communication lines.[9] In addition, communication lines in San Antonio were damaged.[5] At William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, 11\u00a0planes were damaged when a hangar collapsed, resulting in losses of $250,000.[7] Hermann Park was also affected by the storm, where nine goats began to roam within the park due to a broken fence caused by a fallen limb.[10] 35\u00a0convicts were freed from the Ramsey Unit state prison during the storm due to the chance of the prison collapsing. However, after the storm, only eight returned to the prison, leaving 27\u00a0others missing.[11] After the storm, the American Red Cross brought supplies to areas affected by the hurricane, requesting as much as $10,000 in relief work.[12] Several other local relief committees also brought supplies to affected areas.[13] An estimated $2\u00a0million in damages from the storm were attributed to crop damage alone, especially rice and cotton.[12] The storm was estimated to have killed 40\u00a0people and caused $7.5\u00a0million in damage.[6]",

      "Typhoon Nabi": " Typhoon Nabi (pronounced [na.bi]), known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Jolina, was a powerful typhoon that struck southwestern Japan in September 2005. The 14th named storm of the 2005 Pacific typhoon season, Nabi formed on August\u00a029 to the east of the Northern Mariana Islands. It moved westward and passed about 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) north of Saipan on August\u00a031 as an intensifying typhoon. On the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status, with winds equivalent to that of a Category\u00a05 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on September\u00a02. Nabi weakened while curving to the north, striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September\u00a06. After brushing South Korea, the storm turned to the northeast, passing over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September\u00a08, before dissipating on September\u00a012. The typhoon first affected the Northern Mariana Islands, where it left US$2.5\u00a0million in damage,[nb 1] while damaging or destroying 114\u00a0homes. The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4\u00a0million in damage. About 250,000\u00a0people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left \u00a54.08\u00a0billion[nb 2] (US$36.9\u00a0million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322\u00a0mm (52.0\u00a0in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61\u00a0daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29\u00a0people and caused \u00a594.9\u00a0billion (US$854\u00a0million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon affected the Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35\u00a0people.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On August\u00a028, a large area of convection persisted about 1,035\u00a0km (643\u00a0mi) east of Guam. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, the system quickly organized while moving westward, its track influenced by a ridge to the north.[2] At 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, a tropical depression formed from the system,[3] classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 3] as Tropical Depression 14W. In initial forecasts, the agency anticipated steady strengthening,[5] due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area.[6] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a029, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 4] upgraded it to a tropical storm.[7] As such, the JMA named the storm Nabi.[nb 5][2] About 12\u00a0hours later, the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm,[3] after the convection organized into spiral rainbands.[6] At 18:00\u00a0UTC, Nabi intensified to typhoon status, reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[3] On August\u00a031, Nabi passed about 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) north-northeast of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands during its closest approach.[8] The typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September\u00a01, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon and later estimated peak one-minute winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph); this is the equivalent of a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. By contrast, the JMA estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) on September\u00a02, with a barometric pressure of 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg).[2][3] While at peak intensity, the typhoon developed a large 95\u00a0km (59\u00a0mi) wide eye.[9] For about 36\u00a0hours, Nabi maintained its peak winds, during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of PAGASA;[2][3] the Philippine-based agency gave it the local name \"Jolina\", although the storm remained away from the country.[2] On September\u00a03, Nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north, the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge.[2] Later that day, the winds leveled off at 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph), according to the JMA. On September\u00a05, Nabi passed near Kitadait\u014djima and Yakushima, part of the Dait\u014d and \u014csumi island groups offshore southern Japan.[7] Around that time, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph).[3] After turning due north, Nabi made landfall near Isahaya, Nagasaki around 05:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, after passing through the Amakusa of Kumamoto.[10] Shortly thereafter, the storm entered the Sea of Japan.[7] The typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid-latitude flow, influenced by a low over the Kamchatka Peninsula.[11] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Nabi, declaring it extratropical,[12] although the JMA continued tracking the storm. On the next day, Nabi moved across northern Hokkaido into the Sea of Okhotsk. The JMA declared the storm as extratropical on September\u00a08, which continued eastward until the JMA ceased monitoring the storm's remnants on September\u00a010, while situated south of the Aleutian Islands.[7] The remnants of Nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern Alaska on September\u00a012, dissipating soon afterward.[13]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "After Nabi formed as a tropical depression on August\u00a029, the local National Weather Service office on Guam issued a tropical storm watch for the islands Tinian, Rota, Sapian, and Agrihan.[14] On August\u00a030, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for Rota and Agrihan, while a typhoon warning was issued for Tinian and Saipan.[15] On all four islands, a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared. The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly-built buildings to evacuate, and several schools operated as shelters.[16] About 700\u00a0people evacuated on Saipan,[17] and the airport was closed, stranding about 1,000\u00a0travelers.[18] As a precaution, schools were closed on Guam on August\u00a031, after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior. The island's governor, Felix Perez Camacho, also declared a condition of readiness 2,[16] as well as a state of emergency.[19] Due to the typhoon, several flights were canceled or delayed at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam.[20] Ahead of the storm, United States Forces Japan evacuated planes from Okinawa to either Guam or mainland Japan to prevent damage.[21] Officials at the military bases on Okinawa advised residents to remain inside during the storm's passage. While Nabi was turning to the north, the island was placed under a Condition of Readiness 2.[22] At the military base in Sasebo, ships also evacuated,[23] and several buildings were closed after a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared.[24] In Kyushu, officials evacuated over a quarter of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan.[25] These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides. The first order during the storm took place in the Arita district. In Miyazaki City, 21,483\u00a0households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000\u00a0residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports.[26] The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down.[2] Canceled train services affected 77,800\u00a0people on Shikoku.[27] Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation for tens of thousands of people. In addition, at least 723\u00a0flights were cancelled because of the storm.[28] Japan's second-largest refinery, Idemitsu Kosan, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest refinery, Nippon Oil, stopped all sea shipments. The Cosmo Oil Company, Japan's fourth largest refinery, stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries.[29] About 700\u00a0schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500\u00a0soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm.[30] Officials in the Miyazaki Prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area.[26] In South Korea, the government issued a typhoon warning for the southern portion of the country along the coast, prompting the airport at Pohang to close,[31] and forcing 162\u00a0flights to be canceled.[32] Ferry service was also disrupted,[32] and thousands of boats returned to port.[33] The storm also prompted 138\u00a0schools to close in the region.[32] Earlier, the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon Rusa in 2002 or Maemi in 2003, both of which were devastating storms in South Korea.[34] Officials in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning for Vladivostok, advising boats to remain at port.[35]",
      "Impact[edit]": "While passing between Saipan and the volcanic island of Anatahan, Nabi brought tropical storm force winds to several islands in the Northern Mariana Islands. Saipan International Airport reported sustained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (59\u00a0mph), with gusts to 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph). Also on the island, Nabi produced 173\u00a0mm (6.8\u00a0in) of rainfall. The storm destroyed two houses and left 26\u00a0others uninhabitable, while 77\u00a0homes sustained minor damage, largely from flooding or roof damage. Nabi damaged 70\u201380% of the crops on Saipan and also knocked down many trees, leaving behind 544\u00a0tonnes (600\u00a0tons) of debris. The entire island was left without power, some without water, after the storm. On Tinian to the south, Nabi damaged or destroyed nine homes, with heavy crop damage. On Rota, there was minor flooding and scattered power outages. Farther south, the outer reaches of the storm produced sustained winds of 69\u00a0km/h (43\u00a0mph) at Apra Harbor on Guam, while gusts peaked at 101\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph) at Mangilao.[17] Gusts reached 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) at the international airport on Guam, the highest during 2005. The storm dropped 115\u00a0mm (4.5\u00a0in) of rainfall in 24\u00a0hours on the island.[36] Flooding covered roads for several hours and entered classrooms at Untalan Middle School, forcing hundreds of students to evacuate. Damage in the region was estimated US$2.5\u00a0million.[17] After Nabi exited the region, it produced high surf for several days on Guam and Saipan.[36] Later in its duration, Nabi brushed southeastern South Korea with rainbands.[2] Ulsan recorded a 24\u2011hour rainfall total of 319\u00a0mm (12.6\u00a0in),[2] while Pohang recorded a record 24\u2011hour total of 540.5\u00a0mm (21.28\u00a0in).[37] The highest total was 622.5\u00a0mm (24.51\u00a0in) of rainfall.[38] The periphery of the storm produced gusts of 121\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) in the port city of Busan,[33] strong enough to damage eight billboards and knock trees over.[2] Heavy rains caused several traffic accidents and injuries in Busan,[33] while strong waves washed a cargo ship ashore in Pohang.[2] Throughout South Korea, the storm led to six fatalities and caused US$115.4\u00a0million in damages.[39][38] In the Kuril Islands of Russia, Nabi dropped about 75\u00a0mm (3.0\u00a0in) of rain, equivalent to the monthly average. Gusts reached 83\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph), weak enough not to cause major damage. During the storm's passage, high waves washed away unpaved roads in Severo-Kurilsk.[40]",
      "Japan[edit]": "The outer rainbands of Nabi began affecting Okinawa on September\u00a03.[51] The storm's strongest winds ended up bypassing the island, and wind gusts peaked at 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph).[23] Two elderly women were injured from the wind gusts. There were minor power outages and some houses were damaged.[52] In the Amami Islands between Okinawa and mainland Japan, Nabi produced gusts of 122\u00a0km/h (76\u00a0mph) in Kikaijima.[53] Waves of 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in height affected Amami \u014cshima.[54] While moving through western Japan, Nabi dropped heavy rainfall that totaled 1,322\u00a0mm (52.0\u00a0in) over a three-day period in Miyazaki Prefecture,[53][55] the equivalent to nearly three times the average annual precipitation.[56] The same station in Miyazaki reported a 24\u2011hour rainfall total of 932\u00a0mm (36.7\u00a0in), as well as an hourly total of 66\u00a0mm (2.6\u00a0in).[53] Within the main islands of Japan, Nabi dropped 228.6\u00a0mm (9.00\u00a0in) of rainfall per hour in the capital Tokyo.[2] During the storm's passage, there were 61\u00a0daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan.[2] The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment displaced by the rains was estimated at 4,456\u00a0m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630\u00a0m3 (22,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) of driftwood was recorded.[57] However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures.[58][59] In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119\u00a0km/h (74\u00a0mph).[53] The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings.[60] In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a Foehn wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly.[61] Throughout Japan, Nabi caused damage in 31 of the 47\u00a0prefectures,[62] leaving over 270,000\u00a0residences without power.[2] Torrential rains caused flooding and landslides throughout the country.[63] The storm destroyed 7,452\u00a0houses and flooded 21,160\u00a0others.[53] Several car assembly plants were damaged in southwestern Japan,[2] while others were closed due to power outages, such as Toyota, Mazda, and Mitsubishi.[64] In addition, the storm wrecked about 81\u00a0ships along the coast.[53] On the island of Kyushu, damage in \u014cita Prefecture on Kyushu reached \u00a511.7\u00a0billion (US$106\u00a0million), the fifth highest of any typhoon in the preceding 10\u00a0years; about 20% of the total there was related to road damages.[65] In nearby Saga Prefecture, crop damage totaled about \u00a51.06\u00a0billion (US$9.6\u00a0million), mostly to rice but also to soybeans and various other vegetables.[66] Crop damage as a whole on Kyushu totaled \u00a54.08\u00a0billion (US$36.9\u00a0million).[56] In the capital city of Tokyo, heavy rainfall increased levels along several rivers, which inundated several houses.[67] Strong winds damaged \u00a528.8\u00a0million (US$259,000) in crop damage in Gifu Prefecture,[68] and \u00a527.1\u00a0million (US$244,000) in crop damage in Osaka.[69] In Yamaguchi Prefecture on western Honshu, Nabi damaged a portion of the historical Kintai Bridge, originally built in 1674.[70] In Yamagata Prefecture, the winds damaged a window in a school, injuring several boys from the debris.[71] One person was seriously injured in Kitakata, Fukushima after strong winds blew a worker from scaffolding of a building under construction.[72] Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido, where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close.[73] In Ashoro, an overflown river flooded a hotel,[74] and a minor power outage occurred in Teshikaga.[75] Ahead of the storm, high waves and gusty winds led to one drowning when a woman was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes,[76] killing three people. A man who was listed as missing was found dead in a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people.[63] Nabi caused a portion of the San'y\u014d Expressway to collapse in Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing three people.[67] In Fukui Prefecture, the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle, killing him.[77] Overall, Nabi killed 29\u00a0people in Japan and injured 179\u00a0others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at \u00a594.9\u00a0billion (US$854\u00a0million).[53]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "After the storm, members of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni provided $2,500 to the town of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief.[78] Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines.[79] The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses.[80] Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country.[81] Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled \u00a558.8\u00a0billion (US$53\u00a0million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with \u00a512.6\u00a0billion (US$11.4\u00a0million). The total was split between \u00a549\u00a0billion (US$44\u00a0million) in housing claims and \u00a57.9\u00a0billion (US$71\u00a0million) in car claims.[82] The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas in the days after the storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.[83] On November\u00a08, nearly two months after the dissipation of Typhoon Nabi, President George W. Bush declared a major disaster declaration for the Northern Mariana islands. The declaration allocated aid from the United States to help restore damaged buildings, pay for debris removal, and other emergency services. Federal funding was also made available on a cost-sharing basis for the islands to mitigate against future disasters.[84] The government ultimately provided $1,046,074.03 to the commonwealth.[85] Due to the similar pronunciation to the word \"prophets\" in Arabic, and the conflict of religious views,[86] the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization agreed to retire the name Nabi. The agency replaced it with the name Doksuri, effective January\u00a01, 2007,[87] and was first used during the 2012 Pacific typhoon season.",

      "Hurricane Klaus (1990)": "Hurricane Klaus was a minimal Atlantic hurricane that dropped heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles in October 1990. The eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Klaus developed from a tropical wave on October 3 a short distance east of Dominica. It drifted northwestward, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on October 5. Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within 12 miles (19\u00a0km), the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear, which caused Klaus to steadily weaken. After deteriorating into a tropical depression, Klaus briefly restrengthened over the Bahamas before dissipating on October 9 under the influence of developing tropical storm, Marco. Heavy rainfall on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties occurred and 1,500\u00a0people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the impact Klaus had on Martinique, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 27. It tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge, becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the Cape Verde islands on September 28. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the Lesser Antilles it organized further, and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 while located about 115 miles (185\u00a0km)/h) east of Dominica. Located in an area of weak steering currents, the depression drifted to the northwest, and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the National Hurricane Center designated it with the name Klaus.[1] Upon becoming a tropical storm, Klaus was located in an area of 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h) of wind shear, although concurrently it was located over warm water temperatures of 83.1\u00a0\u00b0F (28.4\u00a0\u00b0C).[2] Tracking through a highly baroclinic environment,[3] the storm became better organized, and at 1200\u00a0UTC on October 5 Klaus attained hurricane status about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) east of Antigua; shortly thereafter, it passed 12 miles (19\u00a0km) east of Barbuda, its closest point of approach to the Lesser Antilles. Klaus reached peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 985.0\u00a0mbar (29.09\u00a0inHg), though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained to its northeast due to wind shear.[1] At the time the hurricane was forecast to continue tracking to the north-northwest. However, after weakening to a tropical storm on October 6, Klaus turned westward.[3] Klaus continued tracking just north of the Lesser Antilles, and after continuing to deteriorate from the wind shear, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression on October 8 to the north of Puerto Rico. Later that day, convection redeveloped over the center, and Klaus re-attained tropical storm status as it accelerated toward the northeast Bahamas; it briefly reached winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[1] A low pressure area to its west over Cuba had been steadily intensifying and building toward the surface, and on October 9 it developed into a tropical depression; the cyclone became the dominant system, eventually becoming Marco, and Klaus dissipated under the influence of the system late on October 9. The remnant moisture continued to the northwest, reaching the coast of South Carolina by October 11.[4]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Shortly after Klaus attained tropical storm status early on October 4, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern Leeward Islands from Saint Martin to Antigua, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning as its quick strengthening became apparent; additionally, the government of France issued a tropical storm warning for Guadeloupe. A hurricane watch was issued for the Virgin Islands, though it was dropped as Klaus began to weaken.[5] In Guadeloupe, officials advised citizens to transport livestock to safer areas, and also to avoid potentially flooded areas. Prior to its arrival, schools were closed in Martinique,[6] Sint Maarten, and Antigua. The VC Bird International Airport was closed during the passage of the hurricane.[7] Later in its duration, the government of The Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the central and later northern Bahamas, though it was discontinued as the cyclone dissipated.[5]\nDue to Hurricane Klaus, Space Shuttle Columbia's launch was delayed.",
      "Impact[edit]": "Hurricane Klaus dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles, potentially as high as 15 inches (380\u00a0mm); the hurricane affected many areas struck by Hurricane Hugo in the previous year. On Barbados, flooding from the rainfall blocked a few roads and forced a few families to move to safer areas; lightning from the outskirts of the storm left a portion of the island without power.[6] High winds and rainfall affected the island of Saint Lucia, which destroyed about 15% of the nation's banana crop for the year; damage totaled about $1\u00a0million (1990\u00a0USD).[8] The rainfall resulted in severe flooding on Martinique, which accrued to almost 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) in some locations; two sisters drowned near Saint-Joseph after a bridge was washed away.[6] Several landslides were reported on the island.[9] The passage of the cyclone left damaged and power and telephone systems. 750\u00a0people evacuated their homes in Le Lamentin due to flooding,[6] and a total of 1,500\u00a0residents were left homeless on the island.[7] Offshore, rough conditions damaged a fishing vessel, leaving its two passengers drifting on the boat for 25\u00a0days before being rescued about 640 miles (1,030\u00a0km) to the north-northwest of Martinique.[10] In all, seven people were killed on the island.[11] On Dominica, winds from the hurricane damaged power lines and downed trees in the northern portion of the island.[6] High winds on Antigua damaged a few roofs, and also downed communications from two radio networks.[7] The outer rainbands of the storm dropped light rainfall on the United States Virgin Islands, reaching about 1.25 inches (32\u00a0mm) on Saint Thomas; wind gusts peaked at 33\u00a0mph (53\u00a0km/h) on Saint Croix.[12] Moderate rainfall continued into the Turks and Caicos Islands, with Grand Turk reporting a total of 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) in 36\u00a0hours.[4] On the east coast of Florida, Klaus produced 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) waves and tides of 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along the east coast, due to persistent easterly winds.[13] As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, it produced heavy rainfall between 10 and 15 inches (254 and 381 millimetres) of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people.[4] About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.[14]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "Due to the storm's impacts on the islands of the lesser Antilles, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Klaus from the Atlantic hurricane name lists following the 1990 season.[15] It was replaced with Kyle for the 1996 season.[16]",

      "2015 Accra floods": "The 2015 Accra floods resulted from heavy continuous rainfall in Accra, the largest city in Ghana.[1] The rain started on 1 June 2015. Other causes of this flood is as a result of the improper planning of settlement in Accra, choked gutters which block the drainage system and a few other human factors. The floods have resulted in heavy traffic on the roads in the city and also a halt in commercial activities as markets were flooded and workers trapped.[2][3] Mayor of Accra Metropolitan Assembly, Alfred Oko Vanderpuije described the flooding as critical.[4] At least 25 people have died from the flooding directly, while a petrol station explosion caused by the flooding killed at least 200 more people.[5][6]",
      "Affected areas[edit]": "",
      "Kaneshie[edit]": "The Kaneshie market and its surroundings were submerged, preventing vehicles from moving.[7]",
      "Graphic Road[edit]": "Graphic Road, home to some automobile companies and a hub for scrap dealers and other squatters,[8] was heavily flooded. The Toyota Ghana and Rana Motors showrooms were completely submerged.[9][10]",
      "GOIL fire[edit]": "On June 3, 2015, a GOIL fuel station near Kwame Nkrumah Interchange burnt with people and vehicles in the vicinity.[11] The fire also burnt a Forex Bureau and Pharmacy nearby.[12] Over 200[5] people were feared dead and bodies have been moved to the 37 Military Hospital. The hospital later announced they are unable to hold more bodies.[13][14] The cause of the fire was yet to be determined. On 4 June 2015 the Mayor of Accra Alfred Vanderpuije, Member of Parliament for Korle Klottey, Nii Armah Ashitey and President John Mahama visited the scene.[15]",
      "Response[edit]": "\u2014 President Mahama declared 3 days' national mourning for the victims affected by the flood and explosion. The government also released GH\u20b5 60 million to support victims.[16][17]",

      "Hurricane Gustav": " Hurricane Gustav (/\u02c8\u0261\u028ast\u0251\u02d0v/) was the second most destructive hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. The seventh tropical cyclone, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Gustav caused serious damage and casualties in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, Cuba and the United States. Gustav caused at least $8.31\u00a0billion (2008\u00a0USD) in damages.[1] It formed on the morning of August 25, 2008, about 260 miles (420\u00a0km) southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm that afternoon and into a hurricane early on August 26. Later that day it made landfall near the Haitian town of Jacmel. It inundated Jamaica and ravaged Western Cuba and then steadily moved across the Gulf of Mexico.[2][3] Once into the Gulf, Gustav gradually weakened because of increased wind shear and dry air. It weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on August 31, and remained at that intensity until landfall on the morning of September 1 near Cocodrie, Louisiana.[4] Weakening continued, and Gustav weakened to a tropical storm that evening and to a tropical depression the next day as it meandered around the south-central US. The weak system became extratropical on September 4 and was absorbed by another low on September 5.[4] In total, an estimated 153 deaths had been attributed to Gustav in the U.S. and Caribbean. Damage in the U.S. totaled to $6\u00a0billion (2008\u00a0USD)[5] with additional damage of $2.1\u00a0billion in Cuba[6] and $210\u00a0million in damage in Jamaica.[7]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Gustav formed out of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the Lesser Antilles. It developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature. The NHC designated it Tropical Depression Seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system.[8] At the time, the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrants,[8][9]\nand data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm, which was soon designated Tropical Storm Gustav.[10]\nA brief period of disorganization[11]\nproved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night.[12]\nIn the early hours of August 26, as the storm approached Haiti's southwestern peninsula,[13]\nanother hurricane hunter aircraft confirmed what forecasters already suspected\u2014that Gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds topping 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[14]\nBefore reaching Haiti, its satellite presentation continued to intensify, a central dense overcast became more prominent,[15]\nand the minimum central pressure fell.[16] Hurricane Gustav regained a pronounced eye as it made landfall on Haiti, with 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) winds,[17]\nnear the town of Jacmel.[18]\nAs the hurricane moved over Haiti's mountainous terrain its circulation was disrupted[17] and it lost a little strength.[19]\nAlthough downgraded to a tropical storm, it still had a pronounced eye in its mid- and upper-level structures. Its outflow improved throughout the night of August 26,[20]\nand the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve.[21]\nHowever, the storm's movement slowed, and continued interaction with nearby Haiti, combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast, resulted in further weakening during the day on August 27.[22][23]\nThe storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to Jamaica. On the morning of August 28 it was found that, overnight, Gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought. The storm was also found to have restrengthened nearly to hurricane status.[24]\nIt then was upgraded to a hurricane again during the late afternoon of August 29. At 11:00 a.m EDT (1500\u00a0UTC) on August 30, as Gustav neared the west end of Cuba, it was upgraded to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale,[25]\nwith sustained winds near 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[25] Gustav continued its rapid deepening trend, and three hours later, it had already reached Category\u00a04 strength. Gustav's maximum sustained winds had reached 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h)[26]\nwith a minimum pressure of 941\u00a0millibars.[27] On August 30 Gustav made landfall twice on Cuba: first, on Isla de la Juventud and then on the mainland near the community of Los Palacios in Pinar del R\u00edo Province.[28] At 2235 UTC (6:35 PM Cuba Daylight Time), a weather station at Paso Real de San Diego recorded a wind gust of 184 knots (212\u00a0mph; 341\u00a0km/h), which at the time was the strongest wind gust from a tropical cyclone on record.[4][29] By the early hours of August 31, Gustav entered the Gulf of Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 135\u00a0mph (217\u00a0km/h) and minimum central pressure of 958\u00a0millibars.[30] \nDuring August 31, the storm moved in a northwest direction slightly losing its strength (despite passing over a shortened Loop Current) with sustained winds at 115\u00a0mph.[31] On the evening of August 31, Gustav weakened to a Category 2 hurricane and remained at such intensity until landfall in the U.S.[4] Gustav made landfall along the Louisiana coast with 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h) winds near Cocodrie,[32] at about 9:30 a.m CDT (1430\u00a0UTC). At U.S. landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 70 miles (110\u00a0km) from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extended 200 miles (320\u00a0km).[32] That night, by 10\u00a0pm CDT, Gustav had been downgraded to a Tropical Storm with winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) southwest of Alexandria, Louisiana[33] and by 4\u00a0am CDT on September 2 Gustav had diminished to a Tropical Depression with a threat of severe flooding in the lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas.[34]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Hispaniola[edit]": "In the Dominican Republic, a landslide in a rural area killed eight people.[101] Two people were injured. Government authorities said that some 67,255 persons were evacuated and more than 1,239 homes were damaged with 12 destroyed. 50 communities were isolated by the flooding.[102] Gustav made landfall in Haiti at approximately 1\u00a0pm EDT on August 26, about 10 miles (16\u00a0km) west of the city of Jacmel.[103] While inland, Gustav's rains triggered a landslide in the community of Benet which killed one person.[104] Two more were killed in southwestern Haiti when their house collapsed. Another two deaths were caused by an explosion inside a house, thought to be possibly related to Hurricane Gustav.[105] The southern town of Jacmel, where the hurricane made landfall, was bisected by floodwaters.[54] According to Haiti's National Director of Civil Protection, 77\u00a0people died as a result of the hurricane.[4] Some 2,100 houses were destroyed and another 8,150 damaged, causing an estimated 7,200\u00a0people to live in temporary shelters, including churches, community centers and schools.[106]",
      "Jamaica and Cayman Islands[edit]": "On August 25, Carnival Cruise Lines diverted one of its ships from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Mexico in order to avoid the storm.[38] Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) readied response systems in anticipation of Hurricane Gustav affecting the island.[40] In the Cayman Islands, a hurricane watch was issued at 6\u00a0pm August 25 and upgraded that to a warning on 6\u00a0pm August 27. Banks and non-essential government services were closed Friday to allow residents to prepare. Extra flights were organized to get tourists off the island and, per usual practice, further visits were banned until the All Clear was given. Stores and gas stations were busy and each district office offered free plywood to protect windows and residents hurried about to secure their business interests and property.",
      "Cuba[edit]": "Fidel Castro addressed in a \"reflection,\" published on September 1 in the official daily Granma. \"Two days ago ... out of 11 international press reports devoted to Cuba, none told about the hurricane that moved toward our island and the feverish efforts of our Civil Defense,\" Castro writes. Instead, the news services, \"echoing a Yankee press organization dedicated to the media war and campaigns against Cuba,\" reported about the defection of TV actor Yamil Jaled. (The \"Yankee press organization\" appears to be an allusion to El Nuevo Herald, which broke the news of Jaled's arrival in Miami.) \"What a patriot! What a democrat! What a brilliant example,\" wrote Castro. \"This way, the world is informed about a character a lot less known and important than Hurricane Gustav. They want to make a sacred cow out of him.\"[154]",
      "United States[edit]": "Hurricane Gustav was expected to make landfall near New Orleans almost exactly three years after Hurricane Katrina struck the same region. It also arrived in the midst of the campaign for the 2008 U.S. presidential elections and during the week the 2008 Republican National Convention was scheduled to start. The federal and state administrations, as well as the candidates for the 2008 presidential election were sensitive that Gustav was likely to remind U.S. voters of the \"botched response\" by state and local municipalities and subsequent federal aid authorities to the earlier storm.[146] On August 30, President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney canceled their planned attendance at the 2008 Republican National Convention.[147] Because of the expected U.S. landfall, governors and some other political leaders from Louisiana and other states chose to stay home from the 2008 Republican National Convention.[148] As the hurricane approached the coast, presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain canceled all non-essential opening-day festivities at the convention[149] and said that he might give his acceptance speech via satellite from the affected area.[150] Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and vice presidential nominee Joe Biden, monitoring the situation in the Gulf Coast, encouraged New Orleans residents to evacuate.[151] Obama also announced that he would ask his large network of donors and volunteers to contribute money, goods and work to assist victims of the storm according to what was most needed after the storm hit.[152] Louisiana's Congressional primary election, originally scheduled for September 6, was delayed to October 4, which then delayed the general election for two races that required a runoff vote to December 6, 2008.[153]",
      "Louisiana[edit]": "In the state of Louisiana, 34 parishes were declared as disaster areas.[121]\nHurricane Gustav reached the Louisiana coast on the morning of September 1, making landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana (see rainfall map); however, at 9\u00a0am wind speed at Grand Isle had been 115\u00a0mph (185 km/h),[122] the highest eyewall speed, indicating the eyewall had traveled over 4\u00a0hours along the coast. The center of the storm continued northwest across the state, so damage and deaths were widespread in many areas. Forty-eight deaths in the state of Louisiana were blamed on Hurricane Gustav. Five were due to falling trees, two due to a tornado and the rest were indirect deaths.[4] The tornado also injured two others.[123] Around 1.5\u00a0million people were without power in Louisiana on September 1.[124]\nThe state reported about 100,000\u00a0people remained on the coast, after evacuation.[68] Nearly 2\u00a0million people had evacuated from south Louisiana in the days before Gustav's arrival.[68] The city of New Orleans had the official reopening date on Thursday (Sept. 4),[125] after crews had restored most electric power and other services.[125]\nDamage assessments came as residents returned to inspect their properties. Damage included numerous trees down in various locations, such as around some Marriott hotels,[126] and large tree limbs were broken from oak trees along St. Charles Avenue.[68] Millions of smaller branches were scattered throughout neighborhoods, blown by the strong winds. Area hotels planned to reopen the week of September 8, some by Saturday, September 6 (such as the InterContinental & 16 area Marriotts, which already had electricity restored).[126]\nThe Associated Press[68] reported on the floodwall along the Industrial Canal (the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal), which connects Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River, and is susceptible to surges via the Gulf Outlet. High water splashed over the floodwalls onto new splash guards (designed to prevent foundation erosion), but the walls were not breached.[68] Minor street flooding began in the upper Ninth Ward of New Orleans. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, it was considered to be the worst storm to hit the area since Hurricane Betsy in 1965. An elderly couple was killed when a tree fell on the house they were temporarily staying in and 85% of the area lost power.[127] The community of Houma, Louisiana, and the surrounding area in south-central Louisiana sustained extensive wind damage. The winds blew off many roofs, blew windows out of houses and knocked down many trees and left much of the region without power.[122] Shingles and awnings were scattered throughout downtown Houma.[122] At Ellender High in Houma, the school's new gym was heavily damaged, with a rear wall collapsed.[122] The roof of the Houma-Terrebonne Chamber of Commerce was also blown away. Overall, the area was considered to have dodged a bullet. Had the storm come ashore farther west, the Intracoastal Waterway would have been a highway for storm surge to penetrate into the heart of Houma.[122] However, flooding was relatively minor in the region.[122] Central Louisiana was also hard hit. Many trees and power lines were knocked down in that region as well, and many houses sustained damage from the winds and localized flooding. Part of the roof at the Alexandria Mall collapsed. Two people died in the region\u00a0\u2014 one was electrocuted and one had a tree crush her trailer.[128] The area's water supply was also hampered as power was knocked out to most of the water wells in the Alexandria and Pineville areas.[129] Damage and significant power outages were reported as far north as northern Louisiana, in the Interstate 20 corridor.[130]  Highest rainfall totals received thus far across the state include 16.37 inches (416\u00a0mm) near Bunkie, Louisiana,[131] and 19.17 inches (487\u00a0mm) at Barataria Bay Pass.[132][133][134] President Bush declared 34 Louisiana parishes as disaster areas and visited the area on September 3.[121] On Wednesday, September 3, field staff and emergency supplies from the Arkansas Rural Water Association departed to assist the Louisiana Rural Water Association restore water and wastewater service to impacted communities.[135]  Staff and supplies from other state associations, including Alabama, Mississippi and Florida went on stand-by the same day. By Friday, September 5, response teams from Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi were assisting efforts to restore water and wastewater service. There was little structural damage to the water infrastructure, with power loss the primary difficulty.[136] Rural water teams provided 771 on-site technical assistance visits to 370 affected water and wastewater systems. Later, the LRWA efforts received applause from the Louisiana Joint Select Committee on Homeland Security.[137] The LSU football team postponed their game, scheduled for September 6, against Troy University and rescheduled it for November 15 after damage was caused to Tiger Stadium. The swirling wind in the stadium tore awnings, threw team benches from the sidelines of the playing field into the stands and littered the stadium with debris.[138]",
      "Local events[edit]": "One major sporting event was directly affected by the disaster preparations. On August 30, Louisiana State University (LSU) opened its 2008\u00a0football season against Appalachian State. The originally scheduled kickoff time of 4\u00a0pm CDT would have conflicted with the start of contraflow lane reversal, and Interstate 10 is a key evacuation route through Baton Rouge. Accordingly, LSU moved kickoff to 10\u00a0am CDT.[69] A college football game between Nicholls State University and New Mexico State University, scheduled for September 4, was cancelled.[70] The Triple-A baseball New Orleans Zephyrs cancelled the final three games of their season because of the impending approach of Gustav and evacuation preparations.[71] The New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL) proceeded with plans to evacuate from New Orleans and headed to Indianapolis, where they practiced at Lucas Oil Stadium.[72] The Saints returned to New Orleans to play their first home game as scheduled on Sunday, September 7, defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24\u201320.[73] Hotel and business closures related to Gustav had impact on New Orleans's Southern Decadence celebrations, which were scheduled for August 27 through September 1, 2008.[74][75]",
      "Texas[edit]": "Texas Governor Rick Perry activated 5,000 members of the Texas Military Forces on August 29 in response to the possible crisis, in addition to preparations made by other agencies.[76] As of August 29, other preparations in Texas to deal with Gustav and its effects were implemented.[77] Some evacuees were being placed in Northeast Texas, including in Dallas County, Tarrant County, and Tyler, Texas.[78] In Harris County, Texas, the administrative County Judge Ed Emmett said that the Reliant Astrodome will not be used as a shelter for evacuees if Hurricane Gustav hits New Orleans because Houston is also vulnerable to Hurricane Gustav. Emmett said that it would make more sense to evacuate to a more inland area.[79] Voluntary evacuations of Jefferson and Orange Counties started on August 30 with mandatory evacuations in the two counties started on August 31.[80] Also, the Texas Governor deployed other assets to help handle the oncoming disaster.[81]",
      "Mississippi and Alabama[edit]": "The National Weather Service reported 14 confirmed tornadoes spun by Gustav from Biloxi to Mobile. In Mississippi, damage from Gustav was far less severe than that caused by Hurricane Katrina, with its 2005 storm surge of 27\u00a0ft (8.2\u00a0m); however, Gustav's storm surge was high as 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) in places on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Sections of U.S. Route 90 (including Gulfport and Biloxi) were flooded and some houses were flooded.[139] Two people from Metairie, Louisiana died near Vicksburg in an automobile accident while evacuating from the storm.[140] In Alabama, scattered damage already reached multimillion-dollar levels, with the destruction of the Dauphin Island berm (sand dune barrier) by storm surge waves,[141] flood damage to island roads & homes,[141] and extensive flooding around Bayou La Batre. The manmade sand berm took about two years to complete, and construction of another berm for Dauphin Island started in 2010,[141] which acts as a barrier island for the western Alabama coastline at Mobile Bay.[141]\nA fuller assessment of damage can be expected when more residents return to the coastal areas and further insurance claims are filed.",
      "Multistate agencies[edit]": "On Friday, August 29 several state rural waters associations activated their Water Agency Response Networks to prepare for Gustav's landfall.[86] WARN systems are agreements between rural water associations and government agencies in neighboring states that coordinate the response to large water emergencies. Water technicians and trailers of portable generators, pumps, spare parts and testing equipment were readied along the Gulf Coast and neighboring states to respond to the emergency.[87]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Operationally, Gustav went from a tropical depression to a hurricane in 14\u00a0hours, tying Hurricane Humberto's record of 14\u00a0hours, although this may be disputed in post-season analysis.[88] In the aftermath, the Canadian government sent a C-17 airlifter, with a medical team, from CFB Trenton to assist in the evacuation of New Orleans.[89] and two C-130 Hercules airlift planes from Greenwood, Nova Scotia and from Winnipeg, Manitoba.[90] The United Kingdom sent HMS Iron Duke and RFA Wave Ruler to provide emergency assistance and assess the damage caused by Gustav.[91] Anheuser-Busch provided canned water to affected residents.[92]",
      "Jamaica[edit]": "In Jamaica, 15 deaths were reported after Gustav swept through the area as a tropical storm.[4] Flash flooding was also reported on the island as a result of Gustav's heavy rains.[107]\nThe banana sector in the parishes of St. Thomas, St. Mary and Portland suffered significant damage.[108]\nThe Hope River Bridge linking the capital Kingston with the eastern reaches of the city including Harbour View and St. Thomas collapsed and the Georgia bridge in Portland was destroyed. Jamaica's government ministry initially estimated US$41.8\u00a0million in damage to the road infrastructure in the country.[109] Total damage in Jamaica was estimated at $210\u00a0million.[4]",
      "Cayman Islands[edit]": "In the Cayman Islands, Gustav's heavy rains and storm surge flooded the streets of Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, the smaller easternmost \"Sister Islands\" in the chain. More than 1,100\u00a0people spent the night in government shelters in the three islands as high waves and heavy winds battered the chain, the National Emergency Operations Center said in a statement. Most people waited out the storm in private homes or hotels.[110]",
      "Florida[edit]": "The state of Florida was affected by both the Cuba landfall, with Gustav traveling past the Florida Keys, and the Louisiana landfall (September 1), affecting the Florida panhandle, with storm surge and outer band tornadoes and thunderstorms. Several tornado warnings were issued around the Pensacola area. Panhandle beaches had rip currents,[142] and officials in Pensacola Beach had been passing out pamphlets warning of deadly rip currents that could continue for days.[142] Four people died in rip currents on Florida beaches.[4] The USS\u00a0Oriskany\u00a0(CV-34), now an artificial reef off the coast of Pensacola, shifted 10 feet deeper leaving the flight deck at 145 feet (44\u00a0m) following Gustav.[120] Four people died in a car accident on Interstate 20 near Carrollton, Georgia while evacuating from Louisiana. Two other people in the car were alive and airlifted to nearby hospitals.[143]",
      "Arkansas[edit]": "Because of Gustav's slow motion across northwest Louisiana and Arkansas on September 4 and 5, significant rainfall accumulation was seen statewide. The maximum amount in Arkansas was at Hamburg, where 11.25 inches (286\u00a0mm) had fallen,[144]\nmaking Gustav the third wettest tropical cyclone to affect the state since 1972.[145]",
      "Political implications[edit]": "",
      "Retirement[edit]": "Because of the damage and deaths wrought by the storm, the name Gustav was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in April 2009, and it will never again be used to name an Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Gonzalo for the 2014 season.[155][156]",

      "Tropical Storm Danielle (1992)": "Tropical Storm Danielle was a strong tropical storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth storm of the season, Danielle was one of two tropical cyclones in the year to make landfall in the United States, the other being Hurricane Andrew. It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina. The system quickly reached tropical storm status, and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents. Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds before weakening and hitting the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm quickly dissipated over land. The storm dropped light rainfall throughout its path, and winds were minimal. The combination of Danielle and a high pressure system produced higher than normal tides and strong waves, causing beach erosion and light coastal damage. The waves killed two in New Jersey from a boat sinking, and also destroyed three houses in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Overall damage from the storm was minimal.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A surface trough of low pressure with an area of convection persisted off the southeast coast of the United States on September 18. On the same day, a weak tropical wave which moved off the coast of Africa on September 8 approached the area. A cold front merged with the stationary area of disturbed weather on September 20, and on September 22 a circulation developed 200 miles (320\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.[1] Organization continued as outflow became better defined, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Six later that day.[2] The depression rapidly organized and attained tropical storm status with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) just six hours after forming, upon which it was named Danielle. In response to an approaching trough, Danielle initially moved to the northeast. However, the trough outran the system, and a developing high pressure system to its north resulted in Danielle executing a tight, anticyclonic loop on September 23 to the 24th. The storm strengthened as it turned to the northwest, and reached a peak of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) winds on September 25 while just off the northeastern coast of North Carolina. Danielle turned to the north-northwest, and made landfall on the Eastern Shore of Virginia late on the 25th. It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26.[1]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Early in its life, forecasters had difficulties regarding the future track and intensity of Danielle, including a northeastward motion instead of its loop. After Danielle executed its loop, forecasters consistently predicted a landfall along the northeastern North Carolina coastline.[3] As a result, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings for the coast of North Carolina on September 24, 36\u00a0hours before the storm passed to the east of the state. The continued northward motion caught forecasters off guard, and consequentially tropical storm warnings were not issued for the Delmarva Peninsula until just 12\u00a0hours before the storm made landfall. In addition, forecasters issued tropical storm warnings from Delaware through Watch Hill, Rhode Island, as a precaution.[4] In North Carolina, ferry operations between Ocracoke and the mainland at Hyde County were closed, while officials canceled schools in Dare County, North Carolina due to the approaching storm.[5] Several families voluntarily evacuated St. George's Island in southern St. Mary's County, Maryland.[6] In addition, officials in Delaware recommended evacuations for low-level areas and beaches. As a precaution, officials set up two shelters in Kent County.[7]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "North Carolina[edit]": "The pressure gradient between Tropical Storm Danielle and a ridge of high pressure to its north produced moderately strong winds across eastern North Carolina, peaking at 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) at Alligator River Bridge. Several other locations reported over tropical storm force winds. The pressure gradient also produced higher than normal waves along the coastline, with a maximum of 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) at Duck.[8] Despite passing close to the coastline, Danielle dropped only light rainfall, totaling to 0.2 inches (5.1\u00a0mm) at Cape Hatteras.[9] However, locations in the central portion of the state experienced over 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[10] Waves and high tides from the storm caused flooding along the Pamlico Sound side of Ocracoke and southern Hatteras Island. High tides also resulted in overwash in Pea Island, forcing the closure of Highway 12 due to 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) of salt water. High tides from the storm also destroyed two houses in South Nags Head and one in Rodanthe, two of which were previously condemned after the 1991 Perfect Storm. Three other houses in the Outer Banks were threatened by the storm.[9] Elsewhere in the Outer Banks, damage was minimal, and was limited to pedestrian ramps and steps to the beachfront.[5]",
      "Mid-Atlantic[edit]": "In Virginia, Tropical Storm Danielle produced peak wind gusts of 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henry, though sustained winds remained below tropical storm strength. Rainfall was light along the coast, totaling to around 0.34 inches (8.6\u00a0mm).[11] However, outer bands of the storm produced heavier rainfall in the center portion of the state, peaking at 4.09 inches (0.104\u00a0m) at Charlottesville.[12] The storm also produced higher than usual tides, peaking at 4.42 feet (1.35\u00a0m) at the mouth of the Elizabeth River in Sewells Point,[11] as well as strong waves along the Virginia coastline. The waves caused significant overwash, leaving parts of Norfolk under 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of water. Several homes, businesses, and cars were flooded, as well. The waves also eroded beaches along the coast.[13] Overall, damage was minimal, and there were no reports of deaths or injuries.[11] Upon making landfall Danielle produced an estimated storm tide of 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91\u00a0m) in Ocean City, Maryland. Wind gusts peaked at 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h), also in Ocean City.[6] The storm produced moderate rainfall of over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) across the Eastern Shore of Maryland,[10] while interior amounts experienced slightly lesser amounts of up to 2.79 inches (71\u00a0mm) in Pasadena. Waves from the storm caused minor to moderate beach erosion along the coastline, and the combination of waves and high tides caused moderate street flooding. Near Salisbury, the storm produced a possible hook echo, though no tornadoes were reported. Danielle caused no deaths or injuries in the state.[6] In Delaware, the storm dropped light precipitation, with a maximum amount of 3.75 inches (95\u00a0mm) in Smyrna. Wind gusts peaked at 66\u00a0mph (106\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henlopen.[12] Danielle caused 2 to 3-foot (.6 to .9-m) higher than normal tides, along with strong waves. The combination of the two flooded some coastal houses[7] and resulted in significant beach and dune erosion. The waves also sank four boats and washed away a dock near Slaughter Beach.[14] Gusty winds caused power outages in New Castle County, while persistent rainfall caused sewer interruptions. Overall, with the exception of the severe beach erosion, damage was minimal.[15]",
      "Northeast United States[edit]": "Tropical Storm Danielle dropped light rainfall across much of New Jersey, with some areas in the southwestern portion of the state experiencing over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm).[10] Strong waves from the storm washed out miles of beaches along the coastline. In Ocean City, the waves passed over the boardwalk and into houses. Further north, the waves crashed a four-person, 35-foot (10-m) sailboat near Island Beach State Park. Two managed to swim safely to shore,[16] though the other two occupants drowned.[17] Danielle's outer bands dropped light rainfall from Connecticut through Maine, with isolated locations in Rhode Island and Massachusetts reporting over 3 inches (76\u00a0mm). Damage in New England is unknown.[10]",

It traveled 1,300 miles (2,092\u00a0km) and lasted 22\u00a0hours.[1]",
      "Storm path[edit]": "",
      "North Dakota[edit]": "In the pre-dawn hours of July 4, a band of thunderstorms developed over far eastern North Dakota. Hector International Airport in northwest Fargo recorded winds in excess of 58\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) for 40 minutes and a maximum wind gust of 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h). Many planes were damaged or overturned. The hangars suffered damage as well. The worst damage occurred farther south in West Fargo, North Dakota and in south central Fargo, North Dakota.  Wind gusts in these areas were estimated at as high as 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h). The storm caused $85\u00a0million in damage (1999\u00a0dollars) in the Fargo metropolitan area. Over 40,000\u00a0people were without power. Cars were overturned, roofs were severely damaged, and power poles were blown down.",
      "Minnesota[edit]": "The derecho moved into Minnesota and caused massive damage in Cass, Itasca, and Aitkin Counties, at around $3\u00a0million. A semi-trailer truck was blown over on U.S. Route 53 near Canyon. One person was killed and 60 were injured as the derecho passed through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and Superior National Forest. People were there to enjoy canoeing and other recreation for the Independence Day weekend. Straight line winds in excess of 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) uprooted and snapped off trees in over 370,000 acres (1,500\u00a0km\u00b2) of the 1\u00a0million acre (4,000\u00a0km\u00b2) wilderness area. In total, more than 477,000 acres (1,930\u00a0km\u00b2) of forest was affected in the Superior National Forest in a swath 30\u00a0miles (48.3\u00a0km) long and 4 to 12\u00a0miles (6.4 to 19.3\u00a0km) wide.[2] It is estimated that 25\u00a0million trees were blown down in the BWCAW.[3][4]",
      "Ontario[edit]": "The derecho brought more damage when it crossed the border into Ontario during the early afternoon hours of July 4. At its peak near Thunder Bay, the winds were estimated to have been much stronger, around 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) and it spawned some small tornadoes. One small sailboat was overturned and two people were thrown into the cold waters of Lake Superior. They were rescued by a nearby boater. The storm carved a path of destruction into the sparsely populated forested areas of northern Ontario. The Canadian Pacific track between White River and Chapleau in northeastern Ontario was put out of service by fallen trees. Significant tree and property damage was recorded in Timmins.",
      "Quebec[edit]": "As it raced eastward at 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), the system entered into western Quebec in the T\u00e9miscamingue region around 11:00 p.m. A gust of 65\u00a0mph (102\u00a0km/h) was reported at the automatic station of Angliers. There was also a tremendous amount of lightning associated with this derecho, with around 6,000 lightning strikes per hour. Another person in this derecho was killed at Val-des-Lacs (V on the map) when a tree fell on the victim. A woman was injured when a tree crushed her car. After narrowly missing the Ottawa area, the storm moved quickly into Montreal (M on the map) around 3:00 a.m. heading southeastward toward Maine. Much damage was recorded in the Metropolitan area but the worst affected area of Quebec was farther along its path near Sherbrooke (S on the map) in the Eastern Townships where a church was badly damaged, farm buildings were damaged and 2,000 trees were felled. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec reported that over 600,000\u00a0people lost power; some were without power for over a week.",
      "New England[edit]": "The storm continued southeast and caused more damage in New Hampshire and Vermont, killing one more person, before finally dissipating in Maine after 5:00 a.m. on July 5.",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "The Boundary Waters \u2013 Canadian Derecho is one of the farthest north \"progressive\" derechos to have ever been recorded. The derecho caused well over $100\u00a0million in damage, killed 4 persons and injured 70. Over 700,000 homes and businesses lost power from the event.",

      "Cyclone John": " Severe Tropical Cyclone John was an intense tropical cyclone that rapidly deepened offshore before devastating areas of Western Australia. The system was the second cyclone and first severe tropical cyclone of the active 1999\u201300 Australian region cyclone season. Cyclone John developed from a monsoon trough positioned northwest of Australia on 9 December 1999. As it moved to the west and later south as the result of a subtropical ridge under favourable conditions, the cyclone was able to rapidly intensify. John reached peak intensity on 14 December as a Category\u00a05 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale, the highest rating possible. Cyclone John later began interacting with a mid\u2013latitude trough, which slightly weakened the cyclone prior to making landfall near Whim Creek early on 15 December. Increasingly unfavourable conditions further inland resulted in the cyclone's rapid weakening, before it dissipated during the next day. Cyclone John extensively affected areas of Western Australia, but damage was not as bad as expected. Widespread power outages across the Pilbara region were caused by John. Strong winds caused minor damage to infrastructure across the coast, as well as tree damage. 140\u00a0windmills were destroyed by the cyclone on the coast. Further inland, rainfall associated with the cyclone and its remnants brought flooding, which flooded 25\u00a0houses and caused rivers to overflow. The system was responsible for no deaths and a limited amount of damage. After the season, the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In early December, a monsoon trough north of Australia intensified due to a strong northwest cross\u2013equatorial surge in the South China Sea.[1][2] This resulted in the formation of a tropical low southwest of Timor on 9 December.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on 10 December, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began to monitor the system, designating it as 02S.[3] As it moved towards the west and subsequently southwards, improving upper\u2013air divergence allowed the system to intensify, reaching tropical cyclone intensity on the evening of 11 December and thus attaining the name John.[1] At the time, a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the system revealed a compact system, with a convective rainband tightly surrounding a central cloud\u2013filled eye. A developed anticyclone positioned over the system provided favorable conditions for development. Due to the presence of a subtropical ridge to the east over Australia, Cyclone John was forecast to generally move in a south-southwestward direction.[4] Steadily intensifying, the cyclone attained Category\u00a03 cyclone intensity on the Australian cyclone scale at 1600\u00a0UTC on 12 December. TRMM imagery indicated that the cyclone had developed a banding eye feature, and had good outflow and a symmetric structure. Cyclone John continued to intensify under favorable atmospheric conditions, before reaching its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 cyclone on the Australian cyclone scale at 0800\u00a0UTC on 14 December, while located 170\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) northwest of Port Hedland, Western Australia.[4] At peak intensity, the storm had maximum 10\u2013minute sustained wind speeds of 205\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 915\u00a0mbar (27.0\u00a0inHg).[5] However, after peak intensity, dry air began to become wrapped into the northwestern quadrant of the system. Moving towards the Australian coastline, radar imagery from Dampier, Western Australia showed a strong eyewall associated with John. Cyclone John began to become elongated along a northwest\u2013southeast axis as it neared the coast.[4] The cyclone also began interacting with a mid\u2013latitude trough the southwest. This generated some vertical wind shear, which weakened John slightly and caused it to curve towards the southeast.[1] Cyclone John made landfall near Whim Creek, Western Australia at 0030\u00a0UTC on 15 December with a minimum central pressure between 930 and 940\u00a0mbar (27.46\u201327.46\u00a0inHg),[6] and around 30 minutes later had maximum 10\u2013minute sustained winds of 85 knots (155\u00a0km/h; 100\u00a0mph). The entirety of the cyclone's eye crossed the coast by 0200\u00a0UTC as the storm moved further inland into an area of wind shear and dry air, which caused it to rapidly weaken. The cyclone was last noted by TCWC Perth and the JTWC on 16 December as it dissipated overland.[1]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Prior to Cyclone John's landfall, hundreds of people were evacuated from homes, primarily in Karratha,[7] where two shelters were set up.[8] In Point Samson, 500\u00a0people evacuated to shelters in Wickham, Western Australia.[9] TCWC Perth began issuing hourly warnings for potentially affected areas beginning at 1400\u00a0UTC on 14 December.[4] As the storm made landfall, some residents of Whim Creek took refuge in a shipping container.[9] Strong winds from the cyclone caused widespread power outages to areas in Pilbara.[7] At Cape Lambert, winds averaged 150\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph) for five hours, with a peak wind gust of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph).[6] Karratha suffered minor damage from John, primarily in the form of wind damage. Various trees were uprooted by strong winds, and some homes suffered minor roof damage.[4] Palm fronds in Karratha were blown off palm trees due to strong winds.[8] In Whim Creek, where the cyclone had made landfall, the top floor of a 113-year-old pub and hotel was destroyed.[4] A temporary roof made up of tarpaulins later collapsed in a flood event the following month.[10] 140\u00a0windmills between Whim Creek and Newman were destroyed by the cyclone.[11] Offshore, 220\u00a0cattle aboard a ship died after the ship was battered by rough seas associated with Cyclone John.[12] Production from an oil field off the coast of northwest Australia were down 38%, partly due to being shut down in preparation for Cyclone John.[13] Rough seas from John also caused a maximum storm surge height of 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft), recorded in Port Hedland by the Port Hedland Authority on 15 December.[6] Further inland, Cyclone John brought widespread rainfall and flooding. In Newman, Western Australia, 240\u00a0mm (9.4\u00a0in) of rain was recorded early on 16 December. As a result, some roads and 25\u00a0houses were flooded by the rains. By the evening of that day, the rainfall total had increased to 500\u00a0mm (20\u00a0in).[4] Todd River was flooded after 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) of rain fell as a result of the cyclone.[14][15] Overall John was responsible for no deaths and a limited amount of damage.[1] After the season had ended the name John was retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list.[16]",

The storm was the 41st depression and the 8th typhoon in the 2013 typhoon season. Typhoon Nari was a deadly typhoon that made landfall in the Philippines and Vietnam. Nari made landfall on October 14, 2013 as a moderate category 1 typhoon.[citation needed]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On October 8, 2013 the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to monitor a tropical depression, that developed within an area of low to moderate vertical windshear, about 1,150\u00a0km (715\u00a0mi) to the southwest of Manila on the Philippine island of Luzon.[1][2] The system was subsequently named Santi by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) as it moved along the southern edge of a subtropical ridge of high pressure.[2][3][4] Later that day the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Depression 24W after the systems low level circulation center had started to consolidate.[3] During the next day after central convection over the systems low level circulation centre had increased both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the depression had developed into a tropical storm, with the latter naming it as Nari.[1][5] Nari ensued a period of rapid intensification in the Philippine Sea, with the Japan Meteorological Agency and PAGASA upgrading the system into a typhoon. Nari became a Category 3 as it smashed ashore into Dingalan, Aurora. Power outages affected much of Central Luzon as the typhoon crossed the region.[6] Five people were killed by falling trees and landslides from Nari as it weakened to a Category 2 typhoon on October 12.[7] With land interaction, Nari weakened to a Severe Tropical Storm during October 13. Late on October 14, the system affected Vietnam and made landfall later that day. Due to land interaction, Nari weakened to an remnant low. Early on October 16, both the JMA and JTWC issued their final warnings on Nari, as the system dissipated.[citation needed]\nWithin the Philippines a total of 15 people were left dead while 5 were missing, while total economic losses were amounted to be Php 12.3 billion (US$277.34 million).[8]",

      "Cyclone Orson": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Orson was the fourth most intense cyclone ever recorded in the Australian region.[2] Forming out of a tropical low on 17 April 1989, Orson gradually intensified as it tracked towards the west. After attaining Category 5 intensity on 20 April, the storm began to track southward and accelerated. The following day, the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 904\u00a0hPa (mbar).[1] Orson maintained this intensity for nearly two days before making landfall near Dampier. The cyclone rapidly weakened after landfall as it accelerated to the southeast. After moving into the Great Australian Bight on 24 April, the storm dissipated. Despite Orson's extreme intensity, damage was relatively minimal as it struck a sparsely populated region of Western Australia. Five people were killed offshore and damages amounted to A$20\u00a0million (US$16.8\u00a0million). The storm damaged a new gas platform, delaying the project for nearly two weeks. The most severe impacts took place in Pannawonica, where 70 homes were damaged. Following the storm, cleanup costs reached A$5\u00a0million (US$4.1\u00a0million). Due to the severity of the storm, the name Orson was retired after the season.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Cyclone Orson originated out of a tropical low, monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, that formed northwest of Darwin, Northern Territory on 17 April 1989. The system tracked southwest throughout the day before turning due west and strengthening into a tropical cyclone, at which time it received the name Orson.[3] At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began monitoring the storm as Tropical Storm 28S.[4] The forward motion of the storm gradually slowed as it intensified and on 19 April, Orson attained Category 3 status on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, classifying Orson as a severe tropical cyclone.[2] Later that day, as the storm attained Category 4 status, an eye developed. By this time, Orson began to turn towards the southwest and on 20 April,[3] the storm intensified into a Category 5 cyclone with winds of 210\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained).[2] The JTWC also reported significant strengthening during the same period. They assessed Orson to have attained an intensity equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale on 22 April with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained).[4] Around this time, the storm tracked directly over the North Rankin gas platform. The platform was in the 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) wide eye of Orson for roughly 40 minutes.[5] A weather station there recorded a barometric pressure of 904\u00a0hPa (mbar; 26.69\u00a0inHg)[1] and wind gusts of 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) before the station was damaged. This was, at the time, the lowest pressure ever recorded in the Australian region since records began.[5] It was later surpassed by Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 when that storm attained a pressure of 900\u00a0hPa (mbar).[6] By this time, Cyclone Orson was roughly 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) in diameter.[7] Continuing on a southerly track, accelerating ahead of an approaching cold front, Cyclone Orson made landfall, near Dampier, around 4:45\u00a0am AWST on 23 April (2045\u00a0UTC 22 April).[5] with winds of 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) (10-minute sustained).[2] The JTWC also reported that Orson had weakened, with winds at landfall estimated at 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) 1-minute sustained).[8] Tracking at 28\u00a0km/h (17\u00a0mph), the weakening storm passed over Pannawonica.[5] Less than 12\u00a0hours after landfall, the storm weakened below Category 3 status.[2] By this time, the JTWC was no longer monitoring the system.[8] Around 5:00\u00a0am AWST on 24 April (2100\u00a0UTC 23 April), Orson weakened to a tropical low while situated over southern Western Australia.[2] Continuing to accelerate to nearly 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph), the remnants of the storm moved over the Great Australian Bight late on 24 April.[3] Several hours after moving back over water, the storm dissipated.[5] The Australian Bureau of Meteorology uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds.[9] The conversion factor between the two is 1.14.[10] The Bureau of Meteorology's peak intensity for Orson was 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained, or 290\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained.[2][10] The JTWC's peak intensity for Orson was 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) one-minute sustained, or 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) 10-minute sustained.[8][10]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "As Cyclone Orson approached the coast of Western Australia, residents were urged to prepare for the storm; people proceeded to clean up litter, secure outdoor items and make sure their disaster kits were stocked. All 200 personnel from a A$1.5\u00a0billion gas platform off the coast were evacuated ahead of the storm.[12] Since Cyclone Orson made landfall in a sparsely populated region, its effects were relatively light compared to its intensity.[3] More than 20 fishermen were reported missing during the storm.[13] On 23 April, a rescue mission with three aircraft recovered roughly 20 fisherman, while one was still missing.[13] Offshore, the storm killed four Indonesian fishermen after their ships sank in swells up to 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) produced by the storm.[3] The North Rankin gas platform sustained minor damage despite wind gusts reaching 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph)[14] and waves estimated at 21\u00a0m (69\u00a0ft).[15] The large swells also delayed the find of a major oil field that contained more than 200 million barrels (32,000,000\u00a0m3) of oil. The waves knocked a drill rig used to find oil out of position; it would take several days for the drill rig to be repositioned.[16] After an assessment of damage, it was found that the drill rig snapped off and broke the chains of two anchors before drifting nearly 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) from the platform. The repositioning and cleanup of the drill rig delayed the project by nearly two weeks.[17] The damages from Cyclone Orson increased the total cost of the platform to roughly A$20\u00a0million (US$16.8\u00a0million).[18] Upon making landfall, Orson produced a storm surge of 3.1\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft).[5] This came during low tide, having a height of 1.6\u00a0m (5.2\u00a0ft).[3] Severe erosion was recorded along coastal areas, some losing nearly 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) of rocks.[3][19] Wind gusts in Dampier reached 183\u00a0km/h (114\u00a0mph) and a station near where Orson made landfall recorded a wind gust of 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph).[5] Harbour officials stated that several ships were knocked off their moorings and washed up onshore.[19] In Karratha, the local weather radar sustained roughly A$900,000 (US$760,000) in damages.[12] A nearby airport was also damaged.[19] The jetty at Point Samson was severely damaged and eventually removed.[20] The most severe damage took place in the mining town of Pannawonica, where 70 homes were damaged by the storm. Numerous trees and power lines were downed along the storm's path. Before dissipating, the storm left one additional person missing after contact was lost with his yacht.[19] Later reports confirmed that the missing person drowned during the storm.[21] Twenty people were also injured during the storm, 60 were left homeless and about 1,000 were affected.[22] Total damages from the storm were estimated at A$20\u00a0million (US$16.8\u00a0million) and repair costs reached A$5\u00a0million (US$4.1\u00a0million).[3][23] Due to the severity of the storm, the name Orson was retired after the season.[24]",

      "Typhoon Judy (1982)": " Typhoon Judy, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Susang,[1] was the third tropical cyclone to affect Japan during the 1982 Pacific typhoon season. Forming east of the Philippines in tandem with another system on September\u00a04, the disturbance continued to intensify, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on September\u00a06 and a typhoon on September\u00a08 while tracking northwestward. On September\u00a09, Judy attained its peak intensity, with winds of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). Thereafter, increased wind shear took a toll on the typhoon, as it turned northward on September\u00a011 in the general direction of Japan under the influence of a mid-latitude cyclone. Judy passed over southeastern Japan on September\u00a012; by this time, the typhoon had weakened considerably. Judy became an extratropical cyclone almost immediately thereafter. Across Japan, a total of 26\u00a0people were killed, eight others were rendered as missing, and 86\u00a0were injured. A total of 61,000\u00a0homes were flooded. Three boats sank and highways were cut in 956\u00a0locations. It is estimated that 1,100\u00a0landslides occurred during the passage of the cyclone. Downtown Tokyo sustained the worst of the damage, where 8,000\u00a0homes were flooded. Approximately 200,000\u00a0travelers were stuck after 25\u00a0train lines were flooded, including 17,000\u00a0individuals who were stranded on 40\u00a0stalled trains.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Typhoon Judy can be traced back from a highly active monsoon trough along the low-latitudes of the Western Pacific basin in the first week of September. Two tropical disturbances soon developed, the first of which later spawned Typhoon Irving. By September\u00a04, the systems developed a surface circulation. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on the second system.[2][nb 1] This system rapidly became better organized, and on September\u00a05, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) starting watching the second system.[4][nb 2] Following an increase in organized thunderstorm activity near the center, the JTWC started issuing warnings on Tropical Depression\u00a019 at 1600\u00a0UTC that day. At 2200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a06, Hurricane Hunters reported winds of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (30\u00a0inHg). Based on this, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Judy early the next day.[2][4] Tropical Storm Judy was initially expected by the JTWC to move west-northwest because a subtropical ridge was expected to build north of the system. However, the ridge did not build, which enabled Judy to track northeastward under the influence of a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) located to north of the cyclone.[2] Meanwhile, the storm held its intensity of about 36\u00a0hours, but on September\u00a07, the JMA upgraded the low into a severe tropical storm.[4] Due to the lack of wind shear, Judy continued to intensify.[2] Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also briefly monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on September\u00a08, the JMA upgraded the system to typhoon status. The storm intensified slightly thereafter, and early the next day, the JMA estimated that Judy attained peak intensity of 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 950\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg).[4] Later on September\u00a09, the JTWC reported that Judy reached peak intensity of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category\u00a02 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[2] Shortly after its peak, cool air began to take a toll on the system as it ingested the remnants of the TUTT. By late on September\u00a09, virtually all deep convection associated with Judy was removed from the center.[2] Based on this, the JMA lowered the intensity of the system to 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). Moving slower than expected due to the strong northwesterly flow over the Sea of Japan, the system became better organized due to a brief decrease in wind shear.[2] However, Typhoon Judy failed to intensify further.[4] On September\u00a011, Judy began to accelerate in the general direction of Japan as interaction with the TUTT ceased. The next day, wind shear once again increased significantly; consequently, thunderstorm activity decreased along the southwest portion of Judy.[2] Despite this, no change in intensity occurred.[4] At 0800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a012, Judy moved onshore at Omezaki Point on Honshu,[2] while still producing hurricane-force winds.[4] Four hours later, however, the JMA demoted Judy to a severe tropical storm.[4] Midday on September\u00a012, the JTWC downgraded Judy to a tropical storm.[6] Several hours later, the agency noted that Judy had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone,[2] with the JMA following suit the next day. On September\u00a015, the JMA ceased monitoring the system.[4]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Upon making landfall in Japan,[2] 730\u00a0mm (29\u00a0in) of rain fell in Oshima, including 713\u00a0mm (28.1\u00a0in) of precipitation within 24 hours. Additionally, Kikugawamakinohara sustained a peak total of 91\u00a0mm (3.6\u00a0in) in an hour. Furthermore, a wind gust of 115\u00a0km/h (71\u00a0mph) was measured in Tsukubasan.[7] A total of 34\u00a0people were killed[8] and 86\u00a0were hurt.[9] A total of 61,000\u00a0homes were flooded.[10] Three boats sank.[9] Downtown Tokyo sustained the worst of the damage.[11] Nearby, the Kanda River overflowed their banks, flooding 8,000\u00a0dwellings,[12] including 2,000\u00a0in the Shinjuku entertainment district.[13] Throughout Tokyo, 590,100\u00a0homes lost power; however, power service was quickly restored to all but 20,000. In Shizuoka and Kanagawa, eight people perished because of mudslides. Offshore, one person died due to 3 to 4\u00a0m (9.8 to 13.1\u00a0ft) waves. One person died and three others were lost when a boat with 10\u00a0anglers was capsized due to rough seas off the coast of Kobe.[9] Throughout Tokyo, 12\u00a0people perished and three were reportedly missing.[13] Elsewhere, in Iiyama, a river overflowed their banks, flooding 631\u00a0residencies.[12] Approximately 300\u00a0km (185\u00a0mi) north of Tokyo, in Sendai, a three-story apart complex was turned upside-down.[14] All the residents living in the complex were rescued.[12] About 50,000\u00a0police men and soldiers were mobilized to help with rescue work.[9] A total of 105\u00a0homes were destroyed.[15] In addition, 1,100\u00a0landslides were reported while river banks broke in 20\u00a0places.[16] According to officials, highways were cut in 956\u00a0spots and bridges were damaged in 43\u00a0locations.[15] Around 200,000\u00a0passengers were stranded after railroad lines near Tokyo[9] were inundated in 25\u00a0places.[16] Moreover, around 17,000\u00a0persons on 40\u00a0stalled trains were stranded for the night.[17] Air travel in Tokyo and Handa were halted due to strong winds.[9] Damage nationwide were about \u00a5125.8\u00a0billion (US$505\u00a0million).[18] Typhoon Judy was the second storm to affect Japan within a month,[19] as well as the third to system affect the nation during the 1982 Pacific typhoon season.[20] From all three systems combined, the death toll exceeded 100.[21] A few weeks later, Typhoon Ken became the fourth storm of the year to rake the islands of Japan.[8]",

      "Tropical Storm Linda (1997)": " Severe Tropical Storm Linda, also known as Typhoon Linda, Cyclonic Storm Linda (BOB 08), or in the Philippines as Tropical Depression Openg, was the worst typhoon in southern Vietnam in at least 100 years, killing thousands of people and leaving extensive damage. It formed on October 31, 1997, in the South China Sea, between Indochina and the Philippines. Strengthening as it moved westward, Linda struck extreme southern Vietnam on November 2 with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), dropping heavy rainfall. Once in the Gulf of Thailand it strengthened further to minimal typhoon status, but weakened to tropical storm strength before crossing the Malay Peninsula into the Bay of Bengal, the first storm to do so in five years. It restrengthened in the Indian Ocean to typhoon status, but increasing wind shear and weakened steering currents caused Linda to dissipate on November 9. The worst of Linda's impact was in Vietnam, where 3,111 people were killed, and damage totaled $385 million (USD). Heavy rainfall caused flooding, which damaged or destroyed about 200,000 houses and left about 383,000 people homeless. Widespread crop and transportation damage also occurred, the latter which impeded relief efforts. Several countries around the world sent relief aid, including medical teams, food, and clothing. However, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. Linda later struck Thailand, causing flash flooding and at least 164 deaths. The storm also affected Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia to a lesser degree.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Typhoon Linda were from an area of convection that were first noted east of the Philippines on October 26. A subtropical ridge persisted to the north, which caused the disturbance to move generally westward. On October 29, the system crossed the Philippines and entered the South China Sea. It subsequently began to organize, and late on October 31, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 30W. At that time, the system was located off the northwest coast of Borneo.[1] The PAGASA organization named it \"Openg\".[2] Shortly after developing, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, and was named \"Linda\" by the JTWC. It continued to intensify, reaching winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) as it approached southern Vietnam. At 0900 UTC on November 2, Linda made landfall in the Vietnamese province of C\u00e0 Mau. It maintained its strength over land, and the storm quickly reached typhoon status after entering the Gulf of Thailand; a typhoon is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), although Linda did not intensify beyond minimal typhoon status. Turning northwestward, Linda deteriorated to tropical storm strength, and struck Thailand late on November 3 with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[1] Linda weakened further over the mountainous terrain of the Malay Peninsula, and the storm emerged into the Andaman Sea with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). This made Linda the first tropical cyclone since Tropical Storm Forrest in 1992 to cross from the western Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean.[1] Additionally, upon reaching the Indian Ocean, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the storm as Cyclonic Storm BOB 08, with winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h).[3] With warm waters, Tropical Storm Linda gradually re-intensified as it slowed down, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. On November 6, it again attained typhoon status while located off the southwest coast of Burma (Myanmar).[1] Initially, it was expected to cross the Bay of Bengal and make landfall near the India/Bangladesh border.[4] The cyclone only maintained peak strength for 18\u00a0hours, due to an increase in wind shear from a mid-latitude trough. Linda's motion became nearly stationary, and it gradually weakened for several days. On November 9, Linda dissipated about 375 miles (604\u00a0km) southwest of Yangon, Burma.[1] That day, the IMD also terminated advisories.[3]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials in Vietnam issued warnings to the residents, although its approach was faster than expected, and the region rarely experiences tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Linda dropped heavy rainfall across southern Vietnam, peaking at 9.17 inches (23.3\u00a0cm) in C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1.[5] The storm caused heavy damage in the country, particularly in the southernmost province of C\u00e0 Mau where it struck,[1] but also in B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau, S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng, and Ki\u00ean Giang.[6] The most severely affected regions were poor fishing communities.[7] Overall, the storm damaged 139,445\u00a0houses and wrecked 76,609 more,[8] which left 383,045 people homeless.[9] Thousands of schools were damaged, and 130,815\u00a0dykes were breached.[5] Additionally, the storm destroyed at least 3,122\u00a0boats.[8] The rainfall also flooded 1,750 square miles (4,500\u00a0km2) of rice paddy crop, about half of which in C\u00e0 Mau.[10] A preliminary damage total was estimated at 7.18 trillion dongs (US$385 million).[11] Typhoon Linda caused considerable deaths in Vietnam. Many fishermen and sailors were caught at sea in the path of the storm,[1] unable to escape its path.[5] Within three days, the death toll in Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing,[4] many of them fishermen.[10] By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390,[6] and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the death toll reached 464.[8] Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111.[11] Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857\u00a0people were injured by the storm.[8] The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, and a total of 3,513 people were rescued after the storm.[5] In the weeks after the storm, hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.[12] The Vietnamese government identified basic supplies that it needed in response to the storm; those included various foods, clothing, medicine, shelter supplies, and sanitation equipment.[6] The country made a formal request for international assistance, noting that the storm was the worst in 100\u00a0years, and officials had limited resources due to the unexpected destruction.[5] Prior to the request, the government of Switzerland sent about 500,000 Swiss francs (US$360,000) for immediate relief assistance.[10] Subsequently, ten other countries sent cash or relief supplies worth $2.6 million, including medical shelters from the United States, clothing from the United Kingdom, tents from Russia, and transport goods from Japan.[5] Red Cross workers had to travel by riverboat to bring aid to the most affected communities,[7] due to the poor state of the roads.[12] After two months, the Red Cross distributed 65,401 roofing sheets, 390 metric tons of rice, 11,990 mosquito nets, 6,871 blankets, 3,664 medical kits, and abundant clothing supplies to about 150,000 affected people; the supplies were purchased in Ho Chi Minh City. Eventually, the food supply and health status of the storm victims proved not as bad as originally feared. After the assistance was distributed, the Red Cross shifted focus toward reconstruction. Reconstruction was slow, partly due to a slowdown in economic activity from the Vietnamese New Year. Additionally, the two primary factories responsible for making iron and construction frames were only intermittently open, due to machines failing.[13][14] Elsewhere, moderate damage was also reported in Thailand,[1] where at least 12 casualties were reported on land,[12] and at least 152 fishermen were killed at sea.[15] Flash flooding occurred in six districts, which damaged about 88 square miles (230\u00a0km2) of croplands and destroyed 12 houses. Land transportation was affected, with 184 roads and 14 bridges damaged. The government of Thailand sent 20 medical teams to the most affected areas.[16] Following the storm, about 10,600\u00a0people became sick from flood related diseases.[17] Heavy rains fell in Tanintharyi Division in southeastern Burma (Myanmar), although because the winds were not strong, there was little damage. The typhoon increased smog and haze in Indonesia and Malaysia, which had been occurring for weeks. In Indonesia, the typhoon also removed atmospheric moisture, which lowered the chance for rain in areas affected by wildfires.[4] Cambodia was also affected by the outskirts of the storm.[10]",

      "Hurricane Pali": " Hurricane Pali was the earliest-forming Pacific hurricane on record, being the first Pacific hurricane to occur in January since Hurricane Ekeka of 1992. The first tropical cyclone of the 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Pali originated as an area of low pressure within a persistent trough, near the equator on January 6, 2016. Deep convection gradually built up around the center of the disturbance as the system curved northward, before it organized into a tropical depression on the next day, making the system the earliest recorded tropical cyclone in the Pacific hurricane basin. The system quickly intensified into a tropical storm, resulting in it being named Pali. During the next few days, Pali slowly moved northward while slowly curving towards the west, strengthening somewhat before weakening due to the presence of wind shear. On January\u00a010, Pali slowly turned eastward and proceeded to re-strengthen as wind shear diminished. On January\u00a012, Pali strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale (SSWHS) while curving towards the south. The next day, Pali reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h)[nb 1] and a minimum central pressure of 978\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.88\u00a0inHg). Afterward, Pali quickly began to weaken, as the storm encountered stronger wind shear, with the storm weakening into a Category\u00a01 hurricane several hours later, before weakening into a tropical storm later that day. On January\u00a014, Pali weakened into a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low the next day, since conditions became increasingly hostile. Later that day, Pali's remnants dissipated near the same location where they had formed roughly a week ago. Pali formed and tracked near the equator, forming at a latitude of 3.3\u00b0N and tracking as low as 2.6\u00b0N as a tropical depression. This made Pali the second-lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere at the time, which was extremely unusual, given the unfavorable conditions that are usually in place around the equator. Pali had severe impacts in Kiribati, grounding a cargo ship and killing four people, in addition to causing major coastal flooding, although the total amount of damage was not specified in the island nation's report to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).[2][3][4]",
      "Background and records[edit]": "As currently defined, the Pacific hurricane season lasts from May\u00a015 to November\u00a030, the period in which tropical cyclones are most likely to develop across the basin. Occasionally, systems develop outside these seasons,[5] most frequently in May or December, though some off-season storms also develop in January.[6] Activity in January is extremely rare; only two systems other than Pali have been recorded since 1949: Tropical Storm Winona in 1989 and Hurricane Ekeka in 1992, which became a Category 3 major hurricane.[7][6] Pali was the earliest tropical cyclone recorded in the Central Pacific basin, forming on January 7, beating Tropical Storm Winona by six days.[8] Pali was also the earliest recorded Central Pacific hurricane, reaching hurricane intensity on January 12, beating the previous record-holder, Hurricane Ekeka, by 19 days.[9] Pali also formed and tracked closer to the equator than any other storm recorded in the Pacific hurricane basin.[9][10] Pali became a tropical depression near 3.3\u00b0N.[1] During its final days as a tropical cyclone, Pali reached a minimum latitude of 2.6\u00b0N as a tropical depression, making it the second-lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere, just behind Tropical Depression Nine-C, which attained a minimum latitude of 2.2\u00b0N just two weeks prior;[1][11][12] no other tropical cyclone in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s records in the Central Pacific had ever ventured that close to the equator, dating back to 1842.[9] Tropical cyclones usually do not develop that close to the equator, due to the strength of the Coriolis force at those latitudes, which is too weak to induce the spin necessary to form tropical cyclones.[9][7] Prior to the storm's dissipation, when Pali curved back towards the south, some meteorologists speculated that Pali could cross over the equator into the Southern Hemisphere, given the steering currents in place, which would have been an extremely rare occurrence had the storm done so.[9][13] Unrelated to Pali, the formation of Hurricane Alex over the North Atlantic in mid-January coincided with Pali's development over the Central Pacific. This marked the first occurrence of simultaneous January tropical cyclones between these two basins.[14]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In late December 2015, a long-lived and powerful westerly wind burst\u2014a feature commonly associated with strong El Ni\u00f1o events\u2014triggered the formation of Tropical Depression Nine-C in the central North Pacific, along with its twin, Tropical Cyclone Ula, in the central South Pacific. Tropical Depression Nine-C quickly dissipated by the start of 2016, leaving behind a large area of moisture across the equatorial Pacific.[1][11][12] The persistent, powerful westerly wind burst spurred cyclogenesis within a persistent, low-latitude, west-to-east-oriented surface trough that spanned between 1.0\u00b0N and 3.0\u00b0N latitude as far east as 155.0\u00b0W longitude, resulting in the formation of a weak area of low pressure on January\u00a06, at the extremely low latitude of 1.9\u00b0N.[1] The disturbance developed in an area of high wind shear, which kept the system from quickly organizing. The low and the trough drifted northward, as the subtropical ridge spanning the region was significantly weakened by a passing extratropical storm in the North Pacific. Deep convection then developed near the low and also along a broad portion of the trough; however, thunderstorms failed to concentrate around the center of the disturbance. Fueled by unusually high sea surface temperatures, estimated at 29.5\u00a0\u00b0C (85.1\u00a0\u00b0F), deep convection increased and gradually organized around the low, and the system gradually coalesced into a tropical depression by 06:00 UTC on January\u00a07, at a latitude of 3.3\u00b0N. This marked the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone on record in the Central Pacific, surpassing 1989's Tropical Storm Winona by six days.[8] A ridge aloft centered directly above the system enhanced its poleward anticyclonic outflow, enabling the development of deep convection around its center, and soon afterward, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, which received the name Pali, becoming the earliest tropical cyclone recorded in the northeastern Pacific.[1][15] Pali continued intensifying through the first half of January\u00a08 and nearly reached Category\u00a01 hurricane strength, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds reaching 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), but easterly vertical wind shear caused by the ridge aloft increased and disrupted its center, causing the storm to start weakening and curve northwestward.[1] Steady weakening continued through January\u00a09, as Pali's deep convection was displaced to the west of its low-level circulation center and intermittently pulsed, later leading to a sharp decrease in the storm's intensity.[1] By the end of that day, Pali barely maintained tropical storm strength, with the storm's 1-minute sustained winds registering at 40\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h). The lack of persistent deep convection resulted in Pali being a weaker system, but this permitted the storm to be more resistant to the easterly wind shear, causing its forward motion to decrease significantly.[1] The ridge of high pressure weakened and retreated southward on January\u00a010, which caused the vertical wind shear to gradually diminish. Afterward, Pali started re-intensifying, with persistent deep convection redeveloping near its center and within the storm's western quadrant. This shift in steering currents also caused Pali to slowly turn eastward. Pali almost completely stalled during this time, due to the absence of significant steering currents.[1] On January\u00a011, the ridge of high pressure moved directly over Pali, leading to the reestablishment of poleward outflow above the storm and the eventual development of southwesterly flow aloft, enabling the storm's convection to slowly increase in coverage and organization within all quadrants, and also establishing a northeastward movement.[1] At 00:00 UTC on January\u00a012, light vertical wind shear and high sea surface temperatures enabled Pali to strengthen into a Category\u00a01 hurricane, becoming the earliest hurricane on record in the northeast Pacific basin, beating the previous record set by Hurricane Ekeka in 1992, by 19 days. Around the same time, the storm began curving towards the southeast, as a deep ridge developed to the north. The storm also displayed a well-defined eye by 18:00 UTC that day.[1] Pali continued strengthening while travelling southward, and early on January\u00a013, Pali reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a02 hurricane, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 978 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg).[1][16] During the next few days, Pali rapidly weakened while turning back towards the south-southwest, due to steady increases in southerly vertical wind shear and the loss of Coriolis force. The storm's weakening trend began on January 13 and accelerated through the next day, as Pali moved back towards the area from where it had formed. The storm's eye became indistinguishable by 06:00 UTC on January 13, as the system continued to weaken.[1] Vertical wind shear exceeded 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) by early January 14. Further decay in the organization of the storm's deep convection caused Pali to be downgraded into a remnant low late on January\u00a014, with the system barely being distinguishable within the surface trough where it had spent its entire life,[1][17] and the storm's center dissipated by 00:00 UTC on January\u00a015. However, Pali's remnants continued to persist for a while, before dissipating later that day.[18][19] Pali completed a broad and looping track, dissipating approximately 50\u00a0nmi (58\u00a0mi; 93\u00a0km) from where it had initially developed.[1] While weakening, Pali reached a minimum latitude of 2.6\u00b0N, making it the second-lowest latitude tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere, behind Tropical Depression Nine-C, which attained a minimum latitude of 2.2\u00b0N just two weeks prior.[1][11][12]",
      "Impacts[edit]": "In the 19th session of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)'s Tropical Cyclone Committee, in July 2021, Kiribati reported that Hurricane Pali had severe impacts in Kiribati. While Pali caused a significant amount of property damage, the exact amount of damage was not given in the report to the WMO.[2] Pali caused a cargo ship to run aground on the coast of Kiribati, killing four people.[3] Additionally, Pali's storm surge combined with the Spring Tide and the El Ni\u00f1o-induced above-average sea level, producing major coastal flooding in Kiribati, which caused significant damage to the island nation's coastal infrastructure.[4][20]",

      "Typhoon Nock-ten": " Typhoon Nock-ten, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Nina, was the strongest Christmas Day tropical cyclone worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained winds.[1][2] Forming as a tropical depression southeast of Yap and strengthening into the twenty-sixth tropical storm of the annual typhoon season on December\u00a021, 2016, Nock-ten intensified into the thirteenth typhoon of the season on December\u00a023. Soon afterwards, the system underwent explosive intensification and became a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon early on December 25. Nock-ten weakened shortly afterwards before making eight landfalls over the Philippines.[3] The typhoon weakened rapidly due to the landfalls as it entered the South China Sea on December 26, turned southwest, and ultimately dissipated on December 28 due to the winter monsoon. Nock-ten was the third typhoon to have caused significant impacts in the Philippines, after typhoons Sarika and Haima only two months prior, both of which struck similar areas at a similar intensity. 13 people were known to have been killed by Nock-ten. Damage totals were estimated upwards of US$127.5 million, and because of this, the names Nock-ten and Nina were retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency and PAGASA name lists, respectively.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On December 20, the Japan Meteorological Agency started to monitor a tropical depression that had formed about 1,090\u00a0km (675\u00a0mi) to the southeast of Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia.[4][5] The broad and poorly organized system was being affected by moderate to high vertical wind shear, which was being offset by warm sea surface temperatures.[5]\nSoon, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, with the designation of 30W, based on improved environmental conditions and an ASCAT image.[6] Late on the same day, when central convection was increasing and consolidating over a defined low-level circulation center (LLCC), both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, with the former assigning the name Nock-ten.[7][8] One day later, late on December 22, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm, and Nock-ten started to form an eye revealed by microwave imagery.[9][10] Tracking west-northwestward and then westward along the southern periphery of a deep-layered subtropical ridge, Nock-ten intensified into a typhoon at noon UTC on December 23.[11][12] Immediately after that, explosive intensification commenced with a sharp eye embedded in a symmetric central dense overcast feature.[13] At 06:00 UTC on December 24, Nock-ten reached its peak intensity with estimated ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and the central pressure at 915 hPa (27.02 inHg); therefore, it was the latest-forming typhoon of such intensity or stronger on record.[14] The JTWC also upgraded Nock-ten to a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon, when the system was in an area of low vertical wind shear, excellent dual-channel outflow, and sea surface temperatures of 29 \u00b0C.[15] Although the eye became cloud-filled in the afternoon, it cleared again late on the same day and while the JMA did not raise its intensity estimate further, the JTWC did so.[16][17] On December 25, the JTWC reported that the Dvorak technique analyses at 03:00 UTC from \"all reporting agencies\" indicated a T-number of 7.0;[18] therefore, the JTWC added a non-synoptic entry to the operational best track for that time, indicating one-minute maximum sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[19] However, land interaction soon impacted the typhoon, as its convective cloud tops had become warmer.[18] Later, Nock-ten made landfall over the Philippines eight times: Bato, Catanduanes at 18:30 PST (10:30 UTC) and Sag\u00f1ay, Camarines Sur at 21:30 PST (13:30 UTC) on December 25; San Andres, Quezon at 02:00 PST (18:00 UTC), Torrijos, Marinduque at 04:30 PST (20:30 UTC), Verde Island, Batangas at 09:15 PST (01:15 UTC), Tingloy, Batangas at 10:10 PST (02:10 UTC), Calatagan, Batangas at 11:40 PST (03:40 UTC), and Lubang Island, Occidental Mindoro at 13:00 PST (05:00 UTC) on December 26.[20] The eight landfalls significantly eroded Nock-ten, and the structure became much more asymmetric and ragged.[21] Thus, when Nock-ten emerged into the South China Sea early on December 26, it had weakened into a minimal typhoon.[22] Subsequently, although Nock-ten's structure briefly improved, it was downgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA and a tropical storm by the JTWC early on December 27, as its LLCC had started to become exposed.[23][24] Poleward outflow was no longer offsetting the effects of strong vertical wind shear, leading to rapid weakening.[25] After the JMA downgraded the system to a tropical storm at 09:00 UTC, Nock-ten further weakened to a tropical depression late on the same day.[26][27] Influenced by a Northeast Monsoon surge, the system accelerated southwestward, and convection was unable to develop over the fully exposed LLCC due to high vertical wind shear and colder dry air.[28] The JTWC issued its final warning for the system early on December 28, and the tropical depression dissipated in the afternoon.[29][30][31]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Nock-ten made eight landfalls in the Philippines.[32] According to the NDRRMC, a total of 98,771 families were preemptively evacuated in CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, Bicol, and Eastern Visayas region.[33] A total of 13 people have been reported dead while total damages have been reported up to \u20b16.12 billion (US$123 million).[34] On December 26, 2016, MV Starlite Atlantic sank off the coast of Tingloy, Batangas during the onslaught of the typhoon. The vessel was anchored in Batangas Bay when the typhoon passed over it with winds of up to 185\u00a0km/h in the center and gusts of 215\u00a0km/h. The typhoon generated huge waves between six and eight meters in height, causing the vessel to come off its mooring and drift toward Tingloy where it sank. One person died and 18 were reported missing in the incident, while the Philippine Coast Guard rescued 15 out of the 34 crew.[35][36][37]",

      "Retirement[edit]": "PAGASA announced that Nina had removed from their naming lists, because it had caused over \u20b11\u2009billion in damages; subsequently on January 17, 2017, PAGASA announced that they selected Nika to supersede Nina for the 2020 season. On the other hand, during the 49th annual session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee during 2017, they announced that the Nock-ten had also removed from the naming lists. In March 2018, the Typhoon Committee officially chose Hinnamnor as its replacement name. But the name Hinnamnor was also retired after the 2022 season and was replaced with Ong-mang.[38]",

      "Hurricane Maria (2011)": "Hurricane Maria was a Category 1 hurricane that made landfall on the island of Newfoundland during September 2011. Originating from a tropical wave over the central Atlantic on September 6, Maria moved toward the west and slowly strengthened. While approaching the northern Leeward Islands, however, the system entered a region of higher vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, causing it to degenerate into a low-pressure area. It slowly curved toward the north and northeast around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and regained tropical storm status on September\u00a010. Maria further strengthened to attain hurricane status while making its closest approach to Bermuda. The cyclone attained peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a016, but weakened thereafter because of an increase in wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. Maria made landfall on the southeastern coast of Newfoundland during the afternoon hours of September\u00a016 before becoming absorbed by a frontal system later on that same day. Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy rainfall to portions of the east Caribbean, notably Puerto Rico. Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, and as the storm passed through the extreme northeastern Caribbean, over 15,000 people went without power. In addition, tropical storm-force winds were observed on many of the U.S. Virgin Islands. As the system passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained winds were recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. In Newfoundland, strong winds were recorded, but rainfall totals were relatively minimal. There were no deaths reported in association with Maria, although the storm caused $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Hurricane Maria can be traced back to a tropical wave\u2014an elongated trough of low pressure oriented north to south\u2014that moved westward from Nigeria to Senegal on September\u00a01. The wave entered the eastern tropical Atlantic early the following day and slowly strengthened. By September\u00a06, it had developed a sufficient amount of convection to be designated as Tropical Depression Fourteen, while it was about 700\u00a0mi (1,100\u00a0km) west-southwest of the southern Cape Verde Islands.[1] By this time, it had also developed well-established outflow within the western semicircle of the low-pressure center.[2] The depression continued to increase in strength, and it was upgraded to a tropical storm six hours after formation, receiving the name Maria.[1][3] Early on September\u00a07, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted that although Maria was in an area of favorable atmospheric conditions, most intensity guidance models did not anticipate any strengthening.[4] The system changed little in organization over the next 24\u00a0hours as it moved rapidly toward the west-northwest around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge. Though visible satellite imagery depicted a well-organized circulation center, it was displaced from the strongest convection due to increased vertical wind shear.[5] The system reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) on September\u00a08 before the unfavorable environment began to impede the system's organization. Following a reconnaissance flight into the system early on September\u00a09, it was noted that Maria had degenerated into a tropical disturbance, despite reports of tropical storm-force winds in the northern Leeward Islands.[1] Operationally, however, the NHC kept the system classified as a tropical cyclone and never downgraded it to a disturbance. When the system approached the northern Leeward Islands on September\u00a010, satellite imagery and surface observations revealed an increase in its organization; a subsequent reconnaissance aircraft into the disturbance revealed that the remnants of Maria had regenerated into a tropical cyclone about 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) east-southeast of Antigua.[1] After reaching the southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge, Maria turned to the north as its forward motion slowed considerably. Strong vertical wind shear over the system began to relax by September\u00a014, allowing Maria to slowly restrengthen as the convection redeveloped near its center.[6] At 1800\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, Maria reached Category\u00a01 hurricane status on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale while located roughly 135\u00a0mi (217\u00a0km) northwest of Bermuda.[1] Embedded within increasing atmospheric flow, the hurricane's forward motion accelerated towards the northeast. At 0000\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, Maria attained its peak intensity with winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983\u00a0mbar (29.0\u00a0inHg). Continuing on a northeastward course, Maria began to move over an area with cooler sea surface temperatures and higher vertical wind shear. Around 1800\u00a0UTC, Maria weakened to a tropical storm and made landfall near Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland at 1830\u00a0UTC with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone's circulation was absorbed by a frontal system over the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, on September 18.[1]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Caribbean[edit]": "Before Maria's arrival, tropical storm watches were issued for most of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a08; the watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings at 2230\u00a0UTC. On the following day, Puerto Rico and many of the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands were placed under a tropical storm watch. The watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued around 1500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010, after the strong thunderstorms diminished from Maria's center.[1] The storm's effects on the island of Puerto Rico were primarily in the form of heavy rainfall. Flood waters near Patillas, Puerto Rico, destroyed several homes and bridges, causing $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage.[7][8][9] In the surrounding city of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall flooded and damaged around 150 homes.[7] Many people were forced to relocate after rainfall and mud filled their homes. Near the city of Naguabo, Puerto Rico, the car of a 60-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters on a road. After becoming tangled in bushes, the woman was able to get out of her car and pulled to safety.[10] Nearly a month after the storm, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that federal disaster aid would be available to the island due to Maria.[11]",
      "Bermuda[edit]": "Following Maria's regeneration into a tropical cyclone, a tropical storm watch was issued for the island of Bermuda on September\u00a013. The watch was upgraded to a warning later that day, and at 1200\u00a0UTC the following day, it was replaced by a hurricane watch. All watches and warnings for the island were discontinued by September\u00a015.[1] When Maria bypassed Bermuda on September 15, its outer bands briefly produced tropical storm-force winds across the island.[12] At Commissioners Point, sustained winds reached 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h), with gusts as high as 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h),[13] and winds of 36\u00a0mph (58\u00a0km/h) were reported at L.F. Wade International Airport at 1500\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015.[12]",
      "Newfoundland[edit]": "In anticipation of Maria, Environment Canada declared a tropical storm watch for the coast of Newfoundland on September\u00a015, which stretched from Arnolds Cove to Brigus South. Three hours later, it was upgraded to a hurricane watch, while a tropical storm watch was put into effect from Arnolds Cove to Jones Harbor. At 0600\u00a0UTC the following day, the watches and warnings were replaced by a hurricane warning, and areas between Brigus South and Charlottestown, Newfoundland were placed under a tropical storm warning. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued at 2100\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016. While becoming absorbed by a front on September\u00a016, Maria made landfall on the southern tip of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, where winds of 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) were recorded. Offshore, winds reached up to 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h).[1] The capital city of St. John's experienced heavy rain, though not to the extent that had been forecast, as the storm moved through the peninsula faster than predicted.[14]",

      "Typhoon Nora (1973)": " Typhoon Nora, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Luming, was tied for the fourth-most intense tropical cyclone on record. Originating from an area of low pressure over the western Pacific, Nora was first identified as a tropical depression on October\u00a02, 1973. Tracking generally westward, the system gradually intensified, attaining typhoon status the following evening. After turning northwestward, the typhoon underwent a period of rapid intensification, during which its central pressure decreased by 77\u00a0mb (hPa; 2.27\u00a0inHg) in 24\u00a0hours. At the end of this phase, Nora peaked with winds of 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 875\u00a0mb (hPa; 25.91\u00a0inHg), making it the most-intense tropical cyclone on record (alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958) at the time; however, this pressure has since been surpassed by Typhoon June, Typhoon Tip and Hurricane Patricia. The typhoon subsequently weakened and turned northwestward as it approached the Philippines. After brushing Luzon on October\u00a07, the system passed south of Taiwan and ultimately made landfall in China on October\u00a010. Once onshore, Nora quickly weakened and dissipated the following day. The Philippines and Taiwan sustained the most extensive losses from Typhoon Nora, with 36\u00a0people losing their lives collectively. In the former, more than 1\u00a0million residents were left homeless as high winds and flooding wrecked homes. Damage in the country reached $2\u00a0million (1973\u00a0USD). In Taiwan, more than 1,000\u00a0homes were destroyed and 8,000\u00a0people were left homeless. The typhoon was also responsible for several maritime incidents that killed at least four people.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On September\u00a030, a weak surface low developed within the monsoon trough about 195\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) south of Yap. Drifting northwestward, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression by October\u00a02. Later that day, aircraft reconnaissance revealed the system to have intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was assigned the name Nora.[1] The system's movement soon became slow and erratic, with Nora executing a counter-clockwise loop on October\u00a03.[1][2] After completing the loop, it attained typhoon status and acquired a temporary northward trajectory.[1] Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Luming.[3] Late on October\u00a04, Nora began to undergo a period of rapid intensification.[2] Several aircraft reconnaissance missions were flown by the U.S. Air Force 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron into the storm between October\u00a05 and 6, documenting the typhoon's dramatic strengthening.[4] By the evening of October\u00a05, Nora had attained winds in excess of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), ranking it as a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[1] A recon mission into the storm at this time revealed concentric eyewalls, measured at 14\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi) and 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi). Initially, the aircraft was unable to penetrate into the core of the eye due to severe turbulence; however, they were successful after a second attempt. Once inside the eye, they discovered an almost cloud-free center with \"an amphitheater or bowl-like appearance.\" Stratocumulus clouds were suppressed to an unusually low altitude of 1.2\u00a0km (0.75\u00a0mi). The core of Nora was exceptionally warm, with temperatures reaching a near-record 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) at the 700\u00a0mb level. At 0020\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, a dropsonde released by the reconnaissance team recorded a surface pressure of 877\u00a0mb (hPa; 25.91\u00a0inHg) just inside the eyewall of the typhoon.[4] At this time, maximum winds were estimated to have peaked at 295\u00a0km/h (185\u00a0mph).[1] This intensity ranked Nora as the most-intense tropical cyclone on record in the world, alongside Typhoon Ida in 1958. However, in post-storm analysis, it was noted that since the dropsonde did not record a pressure at the storm's center, Nora was likely slightly stronger than indicated.[4] Since then, Nora's intensity has been surpassed by three other storms: Typhoon June in 1975, Typhoon Tip in 1979, and Hurricane Patricia in 2015.[5][6] Despite the storm's extreme intensity, it quickly began to weaken as it approached the Philippines on October\u00a06. Within ten\u00a0hours, the pressure rose to 894\u00a0mb (hPa; 26.40\u00a0inHg) and later dropped below Category\u00a05 status.[1][4] That morning, Nora turned more northwesterly in response to a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over China.[1] Steady weakening continued over the following days, with the storm brushing the northeastern tip of Luzon, Philippines, with winds of 175\u2013185\u00a0km/h (110\u2013115\u00a0mph) on October\u00a07.[1][2] Nora's intensity leveled out around 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph) on October\u00a08 as it tracked between the Philippines and Taiwan.[1] After passing within 95\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) of Taiwan, Nora turned more northerly before making landfall near Xiamen, Fujian as a minimal typhoon early on October\u00a010. Once onshore, the storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating the following day.[1][7]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Prior to the typhoon's arrival in the Philippines, all domestic flights in and out of Manila were cancelled; however, international travel was unaffected. The United States Air Force also moved its planes from Clark Air Base to other bases in Asia. Additionally, all schools in Manila were closed.[10] Brushing the coast of Luzon in the Philippines as a Category\u00a03-equivalent typhoon, Nora caused considerable damage in the region.[1] Gale-force winds were measured across much of western Luzon, with a peak reading of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) at Manila port.[2] These winds caused scattered power and communication losses throughout the Peninsula.[11] The city of Baguio (population 100,000) lost power for approximately six hours.[10] Crop losses were extensive, with the storm striking close to harvest time.[11] Heavy rains from the storm, peaking at 338\u00a0mm (13.3\u00a0in) in Baguio,[2] triggered significant flooding and caused a breach in the Arnedo Dike in Apalit, Pampanga. Eight towns along a 45\u00a0km (30\u00a0mi) stretch downstream were flooded; however, roads remained passable. Flooding in Manila also prompted the evacuation of 400\u00a0residents.[10] In Caloocan, a child died after being electrocuted by downed wires.[11] Across the Philippines, 24\u00a0people were killed and over 1\u00a0million were left homeless.[12] Damage to crops and property reached $2\u00a0million (1973\u00a0USD).[1] Nora was the first of three typhoons to impact the Philippines in the span of a week, with Patsy and Ruth striking the country on October\u00a012 and 15 respectively.[12] While passing south of Taiwan, rough seas spawned by the typhoon were responsible for several maritime incidents over the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. The Philippine Freighter Asian Mariner, though all 38\u00a0crewmen were rescued. The Greek freighter Baltic Klif capsized about 150\u00a0km (90\u00a0mi) southwest of the Penghu Islands, with three crewmen confirmed dead and several others missing and presumed dead. Additionally, the Taiwanese fishing vessel Jai Tai NR3 became stranded amid 9.1\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) seas, with its bow split open. One of the crew perished; however, the frigate USS Worden was able to rescue seven fishermen despite the dangerous seas.[1] As the storm neared landfall in China, two ships became stranded over the South China Sea and sent out distress signals.[13] Passing within 95\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) of Taiwan, the storm brought gale-force winds and torrential rain to the island. A peak gust of 126\u00a0km/h (78\u00a0mph) was measured in Tungchi, Penghu Islands. The most significant impacts came from the rains, which amounted to 523\u00a0mm (20.6\u00a0in) in Sinkong over a 20\u2011hour span. Widespread flooding and many landslides destroyed at least 1,000\u00a0homes, and washed out bridges, roads, and railroads.[1][2] Twelve people lost their lives and twenty-eight others were reported missing. Additionally, 8,000\u00a0people were left homeless.[1] In Hong Kong, the typhoon produced gusty winds, peaking at 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), though no rainfall was recorded.[14] Although Nora struck China as a typhoon, there were no reports of damage received.[1]",

      "Typhoon Jebi": "  Typhoon Jebi, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Maymay, was the costliest typhoon in Japan's history in terms of insured losses. Jebi formed from a tropical disturbance south-southwest of Wake Island on August\u00a026 and became the twenty-first named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season on August\u00a027. Amid favorable environmental conditions, Jebi quickly strengthened into a typhoon on August\u00a029 as it headed west and rapidly intensified as it passed the Northern Mariana Islands on August\u00a030. Jebi reached its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05-equivalent typhoon on August\u00a031, with 10-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph), and a minimum pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.02\u00a0inHg). Afterwards, Jebi began a slow weakening trend as it turned northwest, briefly passing through the Philippine Area of Responsibility on September\u00a02. Jebi accelerated north-northeast towards Japan on September\u00a03 as it interacted with the westerlies, and made landfalls over Shikoku and near Kobe early on September\u00a04. Jebi quickly weakened over land and became an extratropical cyclone later that day over the Sea of Japan. Its remnants moved over the Russian Far East before dissipating on September\u00a09. Jebi was the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan since Yancy in 1993 and left significant effects across the Kansai region. The typhoon's powerful winds, which broke wind records at 100 Japanese weather stations, damaged nearly 98,000 houses and left nearly 3\u00a0million customers without electricity after blowing down power lines. Heavy rains combined with wind and storm surge to flood over 700 houses and cause widespread damage to infrastructure, including several shrines and historical buildings. Agricultural damage from the adverse weather conditions was significant, with losses from the agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries valued at almost JP\u00a547\u00a0billion (US$430\u00a0million).[nb 1] Fruits were blown off trees, crops were lodged, and power outages affected the storage of livestock and produce. Storm surge inundated part of Kansai International Airport, which, combined with wind and rain damage to the terminals, forced the airport to close from September\u00a04 to 13.[2] Furthermore, access to the airport was cut off when the typhoon blew a tanker into the bridge connecting the airport to the mainland; repairs to the bridge were completed seven months later. Fourteen people were killed in Japan\u2014mostly from falls and flying debris\u2014and 980 were injured. Insured losses were estimated at US$13\u201314\u00a0billion, of which more than a third was from Osaka Prefecture. Elsewhere, Jebi brought minor flooding to the Northern Mariana Islands as it passed to the north on August\u00a031. Heavy swells produced by Jebi caused large waves along the coast of Taiwan that resulted in seven fatalities (including a suspected suicide) from September\u00a02 to 3. As an extratropical cyclone on September\u00a05, Jebi produced gusty winds across the Russian Far East, causing power outages and injuring three.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical disturbance was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on August\u00a026 about 1,020\u00a0km (635\u00a0mi) south-southwest of Wake Island.[3] The disturbance increased in organization over the next few hours, with rainbands wrapping into a developing low-level circulation center.[4] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a026,[5][nb 2] with the JTWC following suit at 06:00\u00a0UTC the next day.[7] Further development was expected as the depression tracked northwest around a subtropical ridge, with high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear ahead in the system's anticipated path.[8] The JMA deemed the cyclone to have attained tropical storm status at 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027 and assigned it the name Jebi;[5][nb 3] with this, Jebi became the twenty-first named storm of the 2018 Pacific typhoon season.[10] The JTWC similarly upgraded the system six hours later.[7] With favorable winds aloft aiding the development of thunderstorm activity, Jebi continued to strengthen as it turned more westward under the influence of the subtropical ridge.[11] The JMA upgraded Jebi to a severe tropical storm at 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a028 as its maximum sustained winds increased to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[5][nb 4] Amid the favorable environment, Jebi began to intensify more quickly on August\u00a029, reaching typhoon status at 06:00\u00a0UTC as it developed an eye feature visible on microwave satellite imagery.[13][5][7] Rapid intensification commenced later that day, as a central dense overcast blossomed over the system's center.[14] From August\u00a029 to 30, Jebi's satellite presentation swiftly improved as its eye cleared out and contracted to a diameter of 19\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi), while convection surrounding the eye deepened.[15][16] The JTWC analyzed that Jebi intensified into a super typhoon by 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a030 with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph),[nb 5] representing an increase of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) in the past 24\u00a0hours.[18] The JMA reported that Jebi reached its peak intensity at 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031 with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph) and a central pressure of 915\u00a0hPa (mbar; 27.02\u00a0inHg);[5] the JTWC estimated that Jebi's winds continued to increase and peaked at 285\u00a0km/h (180\u00a0mph) at 06:00\u00a0UTC.[7] Jebi's intensity leveled off thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle began, with the original eyewall encircled by a larger, secondary eyewall.[19] The cycle completed by 21:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a031 while Jebi began to curve northward through a weakness in the subtropical ridge.[20] Drier air then began to impinge on the southern portion on the circulation, resulting in continued weakening.[21] At the same time, upper-level winds pushed subsiding air over the western part of Jebi's circulation, causing its convection to warm.[22] As a result, the JTWC assessed that Jebi had weakened below super typhoon status by 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a01.[7] Travelling northwestwards, Jebi entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a02 and received the local name Maymay;[23] Jebi exited the  PAR roughly 12\u00a0hours later.[24] Slow weakening continued through September\u00a03 as dry air and subsidence continued to affect Jebi's circulation. Despite this, Jebi managed to maintain a ragged yet well-defined eye.[25] Later on September\u00a03, an extratropical cyclone approaching from the northwest began to accelerate Jebi north-northeast,[26] while interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies caused Jebi to begin extratropical transition.[27] Racing poleward, Jebi made landfall over southern Tokushima Prefecture at around 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04,[28] possessing winds of around 155\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[5][7] In the next two hours, Jebi crossed Osaka Bay and made another landfall around 05:00\u00a0UTC near Kobe, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture.[29] Land interaction and increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the system as it crossed Japan,[30] with the JTWC declaring that Jebi was no longer a tropical cyclone at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04, just hours after it entered the Sea of Japan.[7] The JMA downgraded Jebi to a severe tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC, before later declaring it post-tropical at 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a05 just offshore Terneysky District, Russia. Over the next two days, the remnants of Jebi headed generally north over the Russian Far East while gradually weakening, crossing the 60th parallel north before the JMA ceased tracking the system at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a07.[5]",
      "Effects[edit]": "",
      "Northern Mariana Islands[edit]": "Jebi passed just north of the Northern Mariana Islands as an intensifying typhoon on August\u00a031, necessitating the issuance of a typhoon warning for the islands of Agrihan, Alamagan, and Pagan.[31] A high surf advisory and small craft advisory were issued for Saipan and Tinian as heavy swells affected the islands.[32] The small size of the typhoon's inner core meant that damage in Agrihan, Alamagan, and Pagan was limited to minor flooding.[33][34]",
      "Taiwan[edit]": "When Jebi veered northward on September\u00a02 and 3, east of the Ryukyu Islands, it brought large waves to the east coast of Taiwan. On September\u00a02, at Mystery Beach in Nan'ao Township, Yilan County, five people riding all-terrain vehicles were swept out to sea and drowned; at least four of the bodies were recovered. To prevent further loss of life, Mystery Beach was closed to the public from September\u00a05 to 14.[35][36] At Neipi Beach in Su'ao Township, a passerby drowned while he was rescuing an eight-year-old girl on September\u00a02.[35] One more death occurred there the next day: a woman was swept out to sea in what was suspected by an eyewitness to be a suicide.[37]",
      "Japan[edit]": "Typhoon Jebi was the most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall on Japan since Typhoon Yancy in 1993, causing significant damage in the Kansai region.[38] Fourteen people were killed across the country and 46 others were seriously injured, while another 934 people received minor injuries. The typhoon's strong winds damaged 97,910 houses, of which 68 collapsed and 833 suffered major damage, while heavy rains and storm surge flooded another 707 houses. Another 6,527 buildings were damaged.[39] The General Insurance Association of Japan reported that nearly JP\u00a51.07\u00a0trillion (US$9.69\u00a0billion) in payouts had been made by March 2019, of which JP\u00a5601\u00a0billion (US$5.44\u00a0billion) was in Osaka Prefecture alone.[40] Insured losses were estimated at US$13\u201314\u00a0billion in December 2019, placing Jebi as the costliest typhoon to hit Japan in terms of insured losses.[41] Ahead of the storm, emergency evacuation orders were issued for parts of Osaka, Hy\u014dgo, Nara, Wakayama, and Kagawa prefectures. Evacuation advisories were issued for Ishikawa, Fukui, Yamanashi, Nagano, Gifu, Aichi, Kyoto, Okayama, Tokushima, and K\u014dchi prefectures.[39] The Fire and Disaster Management Agency reported that in total, about 8,000 residents evacuated to 1,667 shelters in 24 prefectures.[42] In Osaka, department stores and other commercial facilities were closed.[43] Public schools were closed in the cities of Kobe,[44] Kyoto,[45] Nara,[46] and Osaka,[47] as well as in Wakayama Prefecture.[48] Several tourist attractions were closed to visitors, including Universal Studios Japan, the Kyoto City Zoo, the Kyoto Aquarium, Nij\u014d Castle, and the Kyoto Imperial Palace.[49] JR-West suspended operations in the Keihanshin region on September\u00a04.[50] Services along the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen,[51] as well as the San'y\u014d Shinkansen between Shin-\u014csaka and Hiroshima stations, were halted on September\u00a04.[52] At least 912 flights in and out of Osaka were cancelled.[53] Factories across the Kansai and Ch\u016bbu regions were closed, with notable companies affected including Daikin, Panasonic, Daihatsu, and Toyota. Major department store operators, such as J. Front Retailing, H2O Retailing, and Takashimaya, closed their Kansai outlets.[54] Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe cancelled a trip to Kyushu to oversee state response efforts.[55] Jebi set new records for 10-minute maximum sustained winds at 53 weather stations and broke records for wind gusts at 100 weather stations in Japan, mostly on September\u00a04.[56] The highest sustained winds from Jebi were recorded at Cape Muroto, at 48.2\u00a0m/s (174\u00a0km/h; 108\u00a0mph). At Kansai International Airport, a gust of 58.1\u00a0m/s (209\u00a0km/h; 130\u00a0mph) was recorded, which was significantly higher than the previous record set by Typhoon Cimaron just 12 days earlier. Significant winds occurred even in urban areas, with downtown Wakayama experiencing maximum sustained winds of up to 39.7\u00a0m/s (143\u00a0km/h; 89\u00a0mph) and gusts reaching 57.4\u00a0m/s (207\u00a0km/h; 128\u00a0mph). Similarly, the financial center of Osaka, Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, recorded a maximum gust of 47.4\u00a0m/s (171\u00a0km/h; 106\u00a0mph).[57] The maximum storm surge produced by Jebi was 3.29\u00a0m (10.8\u00a0ft) in Osaka, surpassing the previous record of 2.93\u00a0m (9.6\u00a0ft) from the 2nd Muroto Typhoon (Typhoon Nancy) in 1961.[58] Across the Kansai Region, massive blackouts occurred as the typhoon blew down transmission lines, with over 2.2\u00a0million customers of Kansai Electric Power Company losing power. Restoration works were fully completed only on September\u00a020, having been hampered by fallen trees, collapsed houses, and landslides.[59][60][61] Other significant power outages were reported in the Ch\u016bbu region, with Chubu Electric Power reporting 695,320 blackouts. Elsewhere, 16,040 households in the Hokuriku region lost power, and another 14,000 households in the T\u014dhoku region were left without power.[62] Numerous incidents resulted from Jebi's high winds and heavy rain. In Shiga Prefecture, a man died after the warehouse he was working in collapsed. A man in Osaka was blown off the second floor of a house and fell to his death; at least five more people in the eponymous prefecture were killed by falls or flying debris. Another man died after he fell from a roof in Mie Prefecture. Part of the glass ceiling at Ky\u014dto Station collapsed, injuring multiple people.[63][64] In Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo, four people suffered cuts when a metal object fell from a building's roof. In neighboring Saitama Prefecture, an elderly man in Kawagoe was injured when he was blown over by a strong gust and a woman was hit by a flying object. Strong winds in Tochigi Prefecture caused a woman to fall and hurt her shoulder, while two others fell while attempting to repair a window on the second floor of their house.[65] Fallen trees trapped 160 elementary school students on a school trip in Kyoto.[66] At the Nintendo headquarters in Kyoto, the logo on the exterior of the building was damaged by strong winds.[67] The LED lighting on the Ts\u016btenkaku tower in Osaka was damaged by flying debris and made inoperable.[68] An oil refinery in Sakai operated by JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy was forced to partially shut after a cooling tower sustained damage.[69] Several shrines across Japan were damaged: the Kasuga Grand Shrine in Nara had its arrival hall damaged by fallen trees, the torii at the entrance of Oji Shrine in Tokyo collapsed,[70] while the torii on the east side of the Naganokengokoku Shrine\u00a0[ja] in Matsumoto, Nagano, was destroyed.[71] One of the three honden of Ono Shrine\u00a0[ja] in Shiojiri, Nagano, which were built in 1672, was severely damaged by a fallen tree.[72] The hall of worship at Hirano Shrine in Kyoto was destroyed and 400 cherry blossom trees on the shrine's grounds were felled. At the nearby Nishi Hongan-ji, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a wall on the southern face of the compound collapsed and a segment of the roof of the worship hall was peeled off.[73] Part of the cliff on the south side of Ueda Castle collapsed, while an iron roof tile was blown off at the Katakurakan building in Suwa, Nagano.[74] The trunk of a 400-year-old beech tree in the Shirakami-Sanchi was snapped by Jebi's strong winds.[75] Along Osaka Bay, the typhoon's storm surge carried away several shipping containers. The Port of Kobe lost 42 containers, which were eventually recovered 10 days later. Some residential areas surrounding the bay were inundated after the storm surge overtopped coastal defenses.[76] In Nishinomiya, the rising waters caused 187 cars at an auctioneer's lot to catch fire by short-circuiting their electrical systems.[42][55] Kansai International Airport was forced to close on September\u00a04, as waves reaching 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) in height overtopped coastal defenses and left a runway and cargo facilities inundated.[77][78] Access to the island was cut off on September\u00a04 when a 2,591-tonne tanker was unmoored by Jebi's strong winds and collided with the only bridge connecting the airport to the mainland.[79][52] As a result, 8,000 passengers and staff were stranded in the airport and were evacuated by ferries and speedboats on September\u00a05.[77] The 11 crewmembers on board the tanker were uninjured and were rescued by the coast guard.[78] The terminals experienced power outages, leaving passengers to wait without air conditioning.[79] A passenger sustained minor injuries from a window broken by the storm.[80] Partial operation of the airport resumed on September\u00a06,[81] with flights allowed to operate out of the undamaged Terminal\u00a02. Other flights were redirected to nearby Itami and Kobe Airports. Terminal\u00a01 began to resume operations on September\u00a013 and the previously flooded runway reopened on September\u00a014.[82][83] The airport reopened fully on September\u00a021, following repairs to an electric power facility and a baggage claim area at Terminal\u00a01.[84] Repairs to the access bridge continued and were completed in April 2019.[85] The temporary closure of the airport\u2014the country's third largest and a major export hub for manufacturers in the region\u2014sparked fears that Japan's industrial production would suffer.[86] The absence of international flights caused tourism in Osaka to decline sharply, with about a quarter of retailers reporting their sales had halved in a survey conducted by Nikkei.[87] The damage to transport infrastructure from a combination of Jebi and other natural disasters contributed to a larger-than-expected contraction in Japan's gross domestic product for the third quarter of 2018.[88] The agricultural, forestry, and fishing industries suffered significantly, with damage amounting to JP\u00a546.81\u00a0billion (US$42.39\u00a0million) across 33 prefectures. A total of 30,996 hectares (76,590 acres) of cropland was damaged by the typhoon's strong winds,[89] which blew down fruit trees and caused lodging of vegetable and feed crops.[90] About JP\u00a511.88\u00a0billion (US$107.6\u00a0million) worth of crops were lost. Across 31 prefectures, 42,918 incidents of damage to agricultural infrastructure were reported, resulting in JP\u00a520.10\u00a0billion (US$182.0\u00a0million) of damage. Another 131 fishing boats and 406 aquaculture facilities were damaged.[89] In the T\u014dkai region, some pigs suffocated after power outages stopped ventilation of the stalls they were kept in. In T\u014dhoku and Hokkaido, many apple farms suffered from apple scab after the typhoon, exacerbating losses.[90] At an aquaculture facility off Kushimoto, Wakayama, run by Kindai University, 600 bluefin tuna were lost after the cage containing them broke, resulting in losses of JP\u00a5100\u00a0million (US$906,000).[91] Extended power outages prevented farmers from shipping raw milk in at least five prefectures. Jebi served to worsen damage inflicted by Typhoon Cimaron, which passed over roughly the same areas two weeks earlier.[92] At the end of September, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced it would be providing subsidies and grants to help farmers offset repair and reconstruction costs.[93]",

      "Hurricane Beatriz (2011)": " Hurricane Beatriz was a Category\u00a01 hurricane that killed four people after brushing the western coast of Mexico in June 2011. The second named storm and hurricane of the 2011 Pacific hurricane season, Beatriz originated from an area of disturbed weather on June\u00a019, several hundred miles south of Mexico, and gradually intensified. Gaining latitude, the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status on the evening of June\u00a020. The following morning, Beatriz attained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) as it passed roughly 15\u00a0mi (20\u00a0km) of Mexico. Due to its interaction with land, the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later. Early on June\u00a022, Beatriz dissipated over open waters. Prior to Beatriz's arrival in Mexico, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas. Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero. Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the Sabana River in Acapulco, killing four people. However, the overall effects of Beatriz were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in mitigating a severe drought.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On June\u00a016, 2011, a trough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis.[1] Though located within an area favoring development, the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west-northwestward.[2] Gradually, convection consolidated around an area of low pressure.[3] On June\u00a018, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within 24\u00a0hours.[4] On the following day, the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two-E by the National Hurricane Center at 1500 UTC. Upon being declared, the depression was located about 335\u00a0mi (540\u00a0km) south-southeast of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Mexico.[5] However, after post-analysis, the depression had  actually developed nine hours earlier. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression was forecast to move into a favorable environment, characterized by low wind shear and sea surface temperatures up to 86\u00a0\u00b0F (30\u00a0\u00b0C).[6] Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season.[7] Early on June\u00a020, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops (denoted by cloud-top temperatures below \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212112\u00a0\u00b0F)) appearing on satellite imagery. A notable increase in southerly outflow also took place.[8] As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened, Beatriz acquired a more northerly component to its track, bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico.[9] Convective bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day.[10] During the afternoon hours of June 20, a hurricane hunter aircraft found Beatriz just below hurricane strength, and subsequently, the system was upgraded just a few hours later, while situated roughly 85\u00a0mi (140\u00a0km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico.[11] Early on June\u00a021, a 23 to 29\u00a0mi (37 to 47\u00a0km) wide eye developed within the central dense overcast. In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85\u00a0inHg); however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch.[12] Throughout the morning of June\u00a021, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15\u00a0mi (20\u00a0km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico.[13] Centered just off the coast of Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening.[14] Hours later, convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm.[15] Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz.[16] The storm's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175\u00a0mi (280\u00a0km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco.[17]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Following the classification of Tropical Depression Two-E on June\u00a019, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo. A hurricane watch was also put in place from Tecpan de Galeana to Punta San Telmo.[5] Later that day, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to La Fortuna.[18] As Beatriz continued to strengthen, the watches and warnings were extended westward to Cabo Corrientes on June\u00a020.[19] Early on June\u00a021, the easternmost advisories were discontinued as Beatriz moved away.[20] Later that morning, all watches and warnings were discontinued in light of Beatriz's rapid weakening.[21] In Colima and Jalisco, residents were warned of heavy rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides. Schools across both states canceled classes for June\u00a021. In Colima, 236 shelters were opened to the public.[22] Additionally, the Mexican Navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief.[23] A total of 980 temporary shelters were opened in Guerrero, many of which were in Acapulco, as many residents were expected to evacuate flood-prone area.[24] An orange-level alert was issued for portions of Chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains.[25] Throughout Western and Southwestern Mexico, the Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (National Weather Service) advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of Beatriz.[26] Across Guerrero, Beatriz produced heavy rain, peaking at 222.5\u00a0mm (8.76\u00a0in) in Copala, Guerrero.[27] Several homes across the state were damaged, though none were destroyed.[24] In Acapulco, 380 homes were inundated by flood waters, prompting evacuations in areas built in 1999 to relocate residents after Hurricane Pauline.[28] Several landslides blocked off roads and a 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) section of a roundabout was destroyed.[29] In the community of Amatillo, three people were killed after being washed away by flood waters.[28] Heavy rains from Beatriz caused the Sabana River to overflow its banks, placing 150 homes across 14 colonias under water.[30] One person drowned in San Agust\u00edn after falling in the swollen river.[24] Twenty-seven colonias in and around the city lost power after muddy floodwaters entered a substation.[28] Throughout Oaxaca, at least a dozen homes lost their roofs due to high winds.[31] Portions of Colima, Chiapas, Michoac\u00e1n and Jalisco experienced heavy rains; however, in many areas, the rain proved beneficial in mitigating a severe drought.[32][33]",

It gradually organized as it took a slow west-northwest course, strengthening into a tropical storm the following day despite its monsoonal structure. The storm subsequently made landfall in Vietnam as a broad but weak tropical storm. Persistent land interaction weakened Sinlaku, leading to its dissipation on August 3. Sinlaku brought heavy monsoonal rains to much of Southeast Asia, especially to Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. Two people were killed in Vietnam, and two people were killed in Thailand.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In late July 2020, an area of atmospheric convection began to persist approximately 410\u00a0km (255\u00a0mi) east of Virac, Catanduanes.[1] Afterwards, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system a low-chance of developing into a tropical cyclone.[2] Although situated within an environment generally conducive for the formation of a tropical cyclone,[2] the low-pressure area moved towards Luzon, emerging in the South China Sea with little to no organization.[3][4] The low-pressure system then later left the Philippine Area of Responsibility and moved towards the South China Sea.[5] By the following hours, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance's chance to develop at medium, assessing that the disturbance is a monsoon depression.[2] On the following day, July 31, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the invest as a tropical depression.[6] In a favorable environment of low vertical shear, excellent equatorial outflow and 31\u00a0\u00b0C sea surface temperatures,[2] the depression continued to organize, and by the next day, the JMA upgraded depression to a tropical storm, naming it Sinlaku.[7] The JTWC would later follow suit, upgrading the monsoon depression to tropical storm status.[8] Sinlaku would later not intensify further, although the JMA said the storm's pressure lowered to 992 hPa (29.29 inHg).[9] The storm would later make landfall on northern Vietnam,[10] and both agencies issued final advisories on Sinlaku.[11][12]",

The storm damaged over 1,400 houses, with 32 houses being flooded with 30-40 centimeters. Two people were dead, 1 in both Hoa Binh and Quang Ninh provinces, and two were injured in the province of Lam Dong. A thunderstorm from the storm broke 29 trees in districts of Hanoi.[14] The Copernicus emergency satellite mapping service was activated on 3 August to support the damage assessment across northern Vietnam.[15] Total damages were about 300 billion \u0111\u1ed3ng (US$12.94 million).[16]",
      "Thailand[edit]": "Moving towards Thailand, Sinlaku's heavy rains caused flash flooding which two people were killed.[15] In Loei Province, the storm brought heavy rains and flash flooding, submerging around 550 households and damaging farmland in the province.

      "Contents": "",
      "Cyclone Alby": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was regarded as the most devastating tropical cyclone to impact southwestern Western Australia on record. Forming out of an area of low pressure on 27 March 1978, Alby steadily developed as it tracked southwestward, parallel to Western Australia. Between 1 and 2 April, the storm quickly intensified and attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 cyclone on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. After turning to the southeast, the storm underwent an extratropical transition as it neared Cape Leeuwin. The storm brushed the cape on 4 April, bringing hurricane-force winds, before rapidly losing its identity the following day. In Western Australia, the combination of Alby's fast movement and hurricane-force winds caused widespread damage. Along the coast, large swells flooded low-lying areas and numerous homes lost their roofs from high winds. Further inland, bushfires were worsened by the storm as it brought little rain, generally less than 20\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in) along the coast. These fires burned roughly 114,000\u00a0hectares (281,700\u00a0acres). Cyclone Alby and the associated brushfires caused five deaths, with the heaviest damage in the town of Albany, Western Australia.[1] A report at the time noted that \"The Perth metropolitan area and nearly every town from Geraldton to Albany was extensively damaged.\"[2] The resulting damage was extensive, with monetary losses reaching A$50\u00a0milelion (US$45\u00a0million). According to a Canadian newspaper, the Associated Press reported initially that officials in Perth said that \"A tropical cyclone Tuesday tore across the southwestern tip of Australia, killing at least five persons and sparking brushfires that destroyed two towns,\"[3], but the two towns supposedly destroyed by fire were not identified, nor was there a report in the local press or subsequent investigations.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Alby was first identified on 27 March 1978 as a disorganized area of low pressure situated roughly 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) north-northwest of Karratha. At this time, the system was characterised as a large cluster of convection converging around the low. Notable development took place over the following three days as the system drifted towards the southwest. Convection began wrapping around the storm, forming banding features.[4] Early on 29 March, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), classified the system as a tropical storm.[5] Shortly thereafter, the Bureau of Meteorology in Perth classified it as a tropical cyclone, assigning it with the name Alby.[1] Gale-force winds were later confirmed on 30 March by the Martha Bakke, located 385\u00a0km (239\u00a0mi) west-northwest of the storm's centre. By then, a large ragged eye developed and Alby steadily intensified through 2 April.[4] At the end of this strengthening, Cyclone Alby attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 on the Australian cyclone intensity scale; a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46\u00a0inHg) was measured at the time and peak winds were estimated to be 205\u00a0km/h (127\u00a0mph) based on the Dvorak technique.[4][1] Additionally, the JTWC assessed the storm to have attained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph), a low-range Category\u00a04 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale.[6] Shortly after reaching this intensity, Alby slowed as it began turning towards the southeast. By 3 April, the storm rapidly accelerated and attained a forward speed of 50\u00a0km/h (31\u00a0mph).[4] This rapid acceleration was due to the cyclone's interaction with a cold front to its south.[7] Gradually weakening, Alby also underwent an extratropical transition as the storm's structure became asymmetrical.[8] Around 1300\u00a0UTC on 4 April, the storm passed within 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) of Cape Leeuwin as an extratropical storm. Due to the rapid movement of Alby, the system maintained winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph) as it reached this point, making it one of the most intense storms to strike the region. By 5 April, the cyclone rapidly lost its identity as it became caught up in a northwesterly flow before merging with the cold front over the Great Australian Bight.[4]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "Retaining winds in excess of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), Cyclone Alby brought damaging winds to much of the region in and around Cape Leeuwin.[4] The highest winds reached 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) in Albany.[7] In Perth, a peak gust of 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) was measured, the third-highest in the city's history.[8] The intense winds, considered unprecedented for many in the region, were attributed to the fast movement of the storm and its location in relation to land. Moving at speeds up to 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph), winds along the northeastern edge of the storm were increased by that amount due to Alby's clockwise rotation. It also allowed for winds to cover a large area northeast of the centre, impacting many areas far from the storm.[7] In general, rainfall was limited and generally less than 20\u00a0mm (0.79\u00a0in); this was due to the fast movement, as well as the asymmetrical structure with most of the thunderstorms south of the center.[4] These winds resulted in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs blowing off. The most severe losses took place in Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% of the apple crop was lost in the Donnybrook\u2013Manjimup area. A total of 154,400\u00a0m3 (5.4\u00a0million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000\u00a0m3 (7\u00a0million ft3) of future growth on established trees. Widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland sea spray. Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.[4] One person died in Toodyay after falling off his roof while trying to repair it.[2] Newspapers connected the death of one person in a vehicle accident in Pemberton to the storm;[9] however, the Bureau of Meteorology does not attribute it to Alby.[4] The large expanse of gale-force winds without precipitation exacerbated 92 ongoing brush fires in the region.[10] These fires erupted into full-fledged wildfires, expanding at a rate of 5 to 10\u00a0km/h (3.1 to 6.2\u00a0mph). A total of 114,000\u00a0hectares (281,700\u00a0acres) of land was burned throughout Western Australia as a result of the fires. Within this area, more than 10,000 sheep and 500 cattle and horses were killed. Over 100 structures, 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) of fencing and tens of thousands of hay bales were destroyed.[8] According to newspaper reports, the towns of Jarrahwood and Yornup were leveled by the wildfires.[9] At least 50 individual fires were fanned by the storm across the region, prompting more than 1,000 firefighters to assist in putting them out.[11] Containment efforts were successful after six days, with the fires put under control by 10\u00a0April.[12] Two people were killed while trying to suppress the fires: one from a fallen tree in Mount Barker and the other in Manjiump when a bulldozer clearing a firebreak flipped over.[2][13] Along the coast, large swells produced by the storm resulted in two fatalities in Albany Harbour as well as significant coastal damage. Tides across the region were expected to increase. Unexpectedly, all forecast values were exceeded by at least 0.3\u00a0m (0.98\u00a0ft).[4] The highest storm tide was in Busselton at 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft), leading to a storm surge of 1.1\u00a0m (3.6\u00a0ft).[8] Here, the surge penetrated roughly 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) inland, forcing several evacuations. This led to significant coastal flooding that damaged dozens of structures, including Busselton Jetty. In Bunbury, water breached the sea wall, inundating 100 homes and prompting the evacuation of 130 residents.[4] Throughout Western Australia, Cyclone Alby was responsible for five fatalities and A$50\u00a0million (US$45\u00a0million) in damage.[4] There was also severe beach erosion associated with the storm, with some areas losing 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) of land.[14] Due to the extensive damage, the name Alby was retired from the list of Western Australian cyclone names following its usage.[15] In the wake of Cyclone Alby, an appeal for relief in the affected region was made by The Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund.[16] The unprecedented scale of damage prompted meteorologists to vastly improve forecasting in the region to be better prepared for a similar storm in the future. At the time, little to no warning was given to residents in the South-West Land Division; this was the result of Alby's abrupt acceleration along a cold front, a complex forecasting situation. It was also regarded as a \"wake up call\" for the region, reminding residents that they are not immune to the effects of tropical cyclones.[7] Cyclone Alby has been used as a benchmark to compare future storms in the region to, such as Severe Tropical Cyclone Bianca in 2011.[17]",

Also in the city the Cumberland Basin flooded with new temporary flood barriers erected for the first time to protect housing.[29] The Severn bore combined with high water leading to flooding in Gloucestershire, as the river burst its banks at Minsterworth, Maisemore, Elmore and Newnham.[29] Widespread coastal flooding and damage occurred in Ireland.[30] Flooding was reported in Cork and County Cork.[31] Flooding began in Cork on 2 January evening tide at 17:45. Clare County Council described the promenade at Lahinch as \"seriously compromised\" following the storm.[32] Images of waves lashing the promenade and spray blowing over the normally popular surfing location, were captured.[33][34] Several families were evacuated from homes in the village after homes flooded.[35] There were further reports of damage across County Clare in Doolin, Spanish Point and Quilty.[32] Inishbofin in County Galway saw heavy seas, which caused extensive damage on the island, including a lighthouse beacon swept off its foundations.[36][37] In Northern Ireland parts of Coleraine in County Londonderry were flooded after the River Bann overflowed, several coastal roads around the region were closed because of flooding.[38] The Isle of Man Government said low-lying port areas were affected, with parts of Ramsey losing electricity, though damage appeared minimal.[39] In Wales 30 homes were flooded in Cardigan.[40] On the Welsh coast 100 residents were evacuated from vulnerable homes in Borth and Aberystwyth.[41] Aberystwyth was hit by destructive high waves for the second time this winter, after it was hit by a storm which followed the St. Jude storm on 2\u20133 November 2013.[42][43] Aberystwyth sea front has previously been severely damaged by storms in October 1927 and January 1938.[44] Damage occurred to sea defences and gardens at St Bees, Cumbria.

Water heights were expected to be higher than a surge event in 2002, which caused 8 million pounds of damage on the island. Islanders were warned of the danger posed by contaminated water and open manhole covers; and vulnerable roads around the island were closed.[9] Natural Resources Wales advised that it was expecting the highest tide to hit the entire Welsh coast since 1997.[10] The Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued warnings on 2 January for coastal flooding on the west coast.[11] It did not initially put out a flood alert for Stornoway in the Western Isles, but later issued one.[12] Coastal warnings were also in place along the north Spanish and Portuguese west coasts on 3 January.[13]",
      "Impact[edit]": "The Channel Islands saw wind gusts reach 87 miles per hour (140\u00a0km/h) on Alderney, with gusts of 75 miles per hour (121\u00a0km/h) in Jersey.[6] The storm brought heavy showers, with reports of large hail and lightning strikes causing damage.\nA thunderstorm in Exeter knocked out some traffic lights in the city.[14] Lightning strikes were also responsible for stopping all rail transport in and out of Cornwall as signalling equipment was damaged near to Liskeard on 3 January.[15] In Aylesbury four families were evacuated from their block of flats after the building was hit by lightning.[16] Hail larger than a one pence coin (20mm diameter) was reported in Somerset, and mammatus cloud on the south coast of England in Bognor Regis.[17] The sea front of Exmouth was closed after a number of trees fell.[14] Numerous sporting fixtures were disrupted in the United Kingdom.[18] Saturated ground and heavy seas led to a section of cliff to collapse at Rock-a-Nore, near Hastings, East Sussex, which was filmed.[19][20]",
      "Inland flooding[edit]": "The Somerset levels saw an increase in water levels, with the Environment Agency bringing in extra pumps to try and manage the water on the flooded moors, which was being hampered as the Agency had to wait for river levels to drop.[46] All major roads into Yeovil were cut off by flood waters on 4 January, with police advising against all travel to the town after the A37 and A359 became impassable.[46]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "The storm's impacts came on the day when the British Government announced that the Environment Agency in the UK would shed 1500 jobs (approximately a tenth of its staff) political questions were raised about the ability of the Agency to deal with future floods. The Government said it was spending more than the previous administration. Initial assessments by Irish local authorities put damage in millions of euros.[47] Aberystwyth University asked students (many of whom were still on Christmas holiday) to not return until after midweek the next week, with fears of further damage from winter storm Christina.[48] Two trains were trapped at Barmouth, after 300 tonnes of track bed on the Cambrian Coast Line was washed away, depositing 800 tonnes of debris on the line causing its closure between Barmouth and Pwllheli at Llanaber. The trains were eventually moved to Chester by road.[49]",

      "Hurricane Gert (1999)": " Hurricane Gert was the fourth of five major hurricanes in the moderately active 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. A Cape Verde hurricane, Gert formed on September\u00a011 off the coast of Africa before heading west-northwest. It reached a peak wind speed of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) by September\u00a015 over the open central Atlantic east-northeast of the Leeward Islands. It gradually curved to the northwest and later to the north, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by Hurricane Floyd. Hurricane Gert passed east of Bermuda on September\u00a021 and began a steady weakening trend at that time. It turned to the northeast, and on September\u00a023, Gert transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the southeast of Atlantic Canada before being absorbed by a larger storm. For several days, Gert threatened to strike Bermuda, prompting the evacuation of tourists. Although Gert's center did not make landfall, it passed a short distance east of the island, producing hurricane-force winds that left 11,000\u00a0people without power. High waves swept two people out to sea at Acadia National Park in Maine. Later, strong waves struck Newfoundland and left heavy marine damage.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September\u00a010, with evidence of a low-level circulation and convective banding. It moved west-northwestward, located south of a subtropical ridge. Based on satellite imagery, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Nine by 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a011 to the south of the Cape Verde islands.[1] Upon its formation, the center was poorly defined, with restricted easterly outflow due to easterly wind shear.[2] After about 24\u00a0hours of remaining somewhat disorganized, the convection became more concentrated on September\u00a012 as banding features and outflow improved. Consequently, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gert, the seventh named storm of the season.[3] After becoming a tropical storm, Gert quickly intensified due to the presence of an anticyclone aloft,[4] as well as warm water temperatures exceeding 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C).[5] Following the development of a warm spot near the center,[6] Gert intensified into a hurricane on September\u00a013.[1] It strengthened further, developing an eye that briefly dissipated before reforming.[7] Early on September\u00a015, Gert attained major hurricane strength, or a Category\u00a03 on the Saffir-Simpson scale.[1] Still moving west-northwestward, Gert continued its steady intensification trend, developing well-defined outflow throughout the circulation that was described as \"outstanding\".[8] After reaching Category\u00a04 status on September\u00a015, Gert strengthened further to peak winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) early on September\u00a016, as estimated on satellite imagery through the Dvorak technique. Satellite intensity estimates reached as high as 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), or a Category 5 hurricane. At the time, the hurricane was located about 720\u00a0mi (1160\u00a0km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles.[1] Around the time of peak intensity, Gert maintained a round central dense overcast.[9] Hurricane Hunters investigated the hurricane on September\u00a016 and indicated a slight weakening trend due to an eyewall replacement cycle.[10] Gradually Gert turned toward the northwest due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge, created by Hurricane Floyd to the west. As it did so, the hurricane re-intensified briefly before resuming a weakening trend,[1] due to increased wind shear and an upper-level trough to its west restricting outflow.[11] After weakening to winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), Gert again re-strengthened to Category\u00a04 status on September\u00a019,[1] as the eye became well-organized within its surrounding convection following an eyewall replacement cycle.[12] By September\u00a020, while the hurricane was approaching Bermuda, the appearance became more ragged due to the intrusion of unfavorable dry air.[13] Early on September\u00a021 Gert weakened to Category\u00a02 intensity, around the same time it turned northward. Later that day it passed about 135\u00a0mi (217\u00a0km) east of Bermuda, producing hurricane-force winds on the island.[1] Steady weakening continued as Gert accelerated northeastward under the influence of an approaching trough.[14] The convection decreased around the center due to cooler water temperatures,[15] and on September\u00a023 Gert weakened to tropical storm status as it approached Newfoundland.[1] After nearly all of the convection had dissipated, the system no longer met the characteristics of a tropical cyclone.[16] As a result, it was declared extratropical at 1200\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023 about 55\u00a0mi (90\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland. About six hours later, the remnants of Gert were absorbed by a larger extratropical storm.[1] Gert was the fourth of five Category 4 hurricanes to form during the 1999 season, the highest number of such storms on record.[17] Later, the 2005 and 2020 seasons tied the record.[18]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Bermuda[edit]": "As Gert was several days away from Bermuda, the NHC advised residents there to monitor the progress of the storm,[19] Due to uncertainties in the future forecast, as well as the size and strength of Gert, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the island on September\u00a019, about two days prior to its closest approach.[12] As Gert moved closer to the island, the watch and warning were replaced by a hurricane warning on September\u00a020, which was maintained until the following day after Gert moved further away.[1] Before Gert passed by the island, officials closed two schools and converted them to emergency shelters. Police workers advised 700\u00a0families to leave their houses. Cruise lines diverted ships away, while hundreds of tourists took flights to leave the island.[20] While passing east of Bermuda, Gert produced 10-minute sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) at Bermuda International Airport. Elsewhere on the island, wind gusts peaked at 87\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) along the coast, while 1-minute sustained winds reached 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) along the harbor. Rainfall on the island was light, totaling only 0.53\u00a0in (13\u00a0mm).[1] Rough surf battered the island, resulting in extensive beach erosion. The well-known Natural Arches were damaged, and part of a house collapsed into the sea.[21] Severe damage was reported along the southern shore of the island. Approximately 11,000\u00a0residents suffered temporary power outages.[22] Several roads were flooded, and the intense winds downed trees. However, the storm's worst effects remained offshore.[23]",
      "United States and Canada[edit]": "On September\u00a020, Hurricane Gert was attributed to generating a rogue wave that swept two people out to sea at Acadia National Park along the coast of Maine.[1] The crew of a lobster boat later found their bodies. Although the storm never approached the United States, seas in the area generally ran 3 to 5\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.52\u00a0m) above normal.[24] Late in its duration, Gert passed just southeast of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4\u00a0ft (23.6\u00a0m) offshore and 30\u00a0ft (9\u00a0m) onshore. In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a wharf, destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along the wharf, a wave swept three people into the ocean, hospitalizing one of them. The wharf required $2\u00a0million (1999\u00a0CAD, $1.9\u00a0million 1999\u00a0USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove.[25] Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland,[1] and in the Grand Banks a station reported winds of 74\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h). Onshore, the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, the adverse conditions from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.[25]",

      "2013 North India floods": "  In June 2013, a mid-day cloudburst centered on the North Indian state of Uttarakhand caused devastating floods and landslides, becoming the country's worst natural disaster since the 2004 tsunami. The rainfall received that month was far greater than the rainfall the state usually received. Debris blocked the rivers, causing major overflow. The main day of the flood was 16 June 2013. Though some parts of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in India experienced the heavy rainfall, some regions of Western Nepal and some parts of Western Tibet also experienced heavy rainfall.  Over 89% of the casualties occurred in Uttarakhand. As of 16\u00a0July\u00a02013[update], according to figures provided by the Government of Uttarakhand, more than 5,700 people were \"presumed dead.\"[3] This total included 934 local residents.[4] The death toll was later placed at 6,054.[1] Destruction of bridges and roads left about 300,000 pilgrims and tourists trapped in the valleys leading to three of the four Hindu Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11] The Indian Air Force, the Indian Army and paramilitary troops evacuated more than 110,000 people from the flood-ravaged area.[6]",
      "Origin[edit]": "From 16 June 2013 a well-marked cyclonic circulation developed around a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, moving westwards, rapidly intensified due to moisture supplied from both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, combining with intense western disturbances from the north,[12] thus causing the Indian state of Uttarakhand and adjoining areas to receive heavy rainfall, leading to 375% of the benchmark rainfall during a normal monsoon.[13] This caused the melting of Chorabari Glacier at the height of 3800 meters and cresting of the Mandakini River,[14] which led to heavy floods near Gobindghat, Kedar Dome, Rudraprayag district, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Western Nepal, and acute rainfall in other nearby regions of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Tibet.[15] The upper Himalayan territories of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are full of forests and snow-covered mountains and thus remain relatively inaccessible. They are home to several major and historic Hindu and Sikh pilgrimage sites besides several tourist spots and trekking trails.  Heavy rainfall for four consecutive days as well as melting snow aggravated the floods.[16] Warnings by the India Meteorological Department predicting heavy rains were not given wide publicity beforehand, causing thousands of people to be caught unaware, resulting in huge loss of life and property.[citation needed] Landslides, due to the floods, damaged several houses and structures, killing those who were trapped.[5][16] The heavy rains resulted in large flash floods and massive landslides.[15] Entire villages and settlements such as Gaurikund and the market town of Ram Bada, a transition point to Kedarnath, had been obliterated, while the market town of Sonprayag suffered heavy damage and loss of lives.[9][17] Pilgrimage centres in the region, including Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath, the hallowed Hindu Chardham (four sites) pilgrimage centers, are usually visited by thousands of devotees, especially after the month of July on wards. Over 70,000 people were stuck in various regions because of damaged or blocked roads.[16] People in other important locations like the Valley of flowers, Roopkund and the Sikh pilgrimage centre Hemkund were stranded for more than three days.[16] National Highway 7 (Old National Highway 58), an important artery connecting the region was also washed away near Jyotirmath and in many other places.[17] Because summers have more tourists, the number of people impacted was substantial.[18] For more than three days, stranded pilgrims and tourists were without rations or survived on little food.[19] The roads were seriously damaged at more than 450 places, resulting in huge traffic jams, and the floods caused many cars and other vehicles to be washed away.[16] On 18 June, more than 12,000 pilgrims were stranded at Badrinath, the popular pilgrimage center located on the banks of the Alaknanda River.[20][21][22] Rescuers at the Hindu pilgrimage town of Haridwar on the river Ganga recovered bodies of 40 victims washed down by the flooded rivers as of 21 June 2013.[23] Bodies of people washed away in Uttarakhand were found in distant places like Bijnor, Allahabad and Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh.[24] Searching for bodies who died during the extreme natural fury of June in Kedar valley continued for several months and even as late as September 2013, about 556 bodies were found out of which 166 bodies were found in highly decomposed state during fourth round of search operations.[25] Although the Kedarnath Temple and the main Shiva Lingam inside was not damaged, its base was inundated with water, mud and boulders from the landslide, damaging its perimeter.[21] Many hotels, rest houses and shops around the temple in Kedarnath township were destroyed, resulting in several casualties. Most of the destruction at Kedarnath was caused by a sudden rapid melting of ice and snow on the Kedarnath Mountain, 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) from the temple, which flooded the Chorabari Lake (upstream) and then Kedarnath. The temple was flooded with water resulting in several deaths due to drowning and panic-driven stampede.[26] Even after a week, dead bodies had not been removed from Kedarnath town, resulting in water contamination in the Kedarnath valley and villagers who depend on spring water suffered various types of health problems such as fever and diarrhea.[5][27] When the flood receded, satellite images showed one new stream at Kedarnath town. No damage at the Kedarnath Temple occurred. The Uttarakhand Government announced that due to the extensive damage to the infrastructure, the temple will be temporarily closed to regular pilgrims and tourists for a year or two, but the temple rituals will still be maintained by priests.[28][29][30] The Temple  opened for pilgrims on Sunday, 4 May 2014.\n[31]",
      "Other regions affected by the disaster[edit]": "",
      "National Capital Region[edit]": "New Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad  and surrounding areas received a high amount of rainfall on 16 June 2013, leading to flooding of the low-lying areas of the cities.[32] The Yamuna River swelled to a new height of 207.75 meters submerging the low lying flood plains along the banks.[33][34]",
      "Uttar Pradesh[edit]": "Six-hundred and nine villages, covering a population of 700,000, in 23 districts of Uttar Pradesh were affected by the flood and drought. As of 11\u00a0July\u00a02013[update], more than 120 deaths were reported from the state. The number of people who went to Uttarakhand were mostly from Uttar Pradesh.[35]",
      "Himachal Pradesh[edit]": "In Himachal Pradesh, floods caused loss of life and property and death toll in the state was 20.[36]",
      "Nepal[edit]": "About 6000 citizens of Nepal were visiting the Indian region, of which 1,000 were rescued as of 22 June 2013.[37] Flooding of the Dhauliganga and the Mahakali rivers had caused extensive damage, with reports of 128 houses and 13 government offices swept away and over 1000 people homeless.[38][39] A bridge that joins the India-Nepal border was highly damaged.[citation needed]",
      "Rescue operations[edit]": "The Indian Army, Air Force, Navy, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Border &\nNational Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Public Works Department and local administrations worked together for quick rescue operations.[15] Several thousand soldiers were deployed for the rescue missions.[40] Activists of political and social organisations were also involved in the rescue and management of relief centres.[41] The national highway and other important roads were closed to regular traffic.[16] Helicopters were used to rescue people, but due to the rough terrain, heavy fog and rainfall, manoeuvring them was a challenge.[42] By 21 June 2013, the Army had deployed 10,000 soldiers and 11 helicopters,[28][43] the Navy had sent 45 naval divers, and the Air force had deployed 43 aircraft including 36 helicopters.[44] From 17 to 30 June 2013, the IAF airlifted a total of 18,424 people -  flying a total of 2,137 sorties and dropping/landing a total of 3,36,930\u00a0kg of relief material and equipments.[45] On 25 June, one of 3 IAF Mil Mi-17 rescue helicopters returning from Kedarnath, carrying 5 Air Force Officers, 9 of the NDRF, and 6 of the ITBP crashed on a mountainous slope near Gauri Kund, killing all on board.[46][47] The deceased soldiers were given a ceremonial Guard of honour by Home minister of India, at an event organised by the Uttarakhand State Government.[48] Indo Tibetan border Police (ITBP) a Force which guards the Indo China borders on the high himalayas with its 3 Regional Response Centres (RRCs) based at Matli (Uttarkashi), Gauchar (Chamoli) and Pithoragarh swung into action and started rescue and relief operation. 2000 strong ITBP force with its mountaineering skills and improvisation methods started rescue of stranded pilgrims. It was a simultaneous effort by ITBP at Kedar ghati, Gangotri valley and Govind ghat areas. According to official figures by ITBP, they were able to rescue 33,009 pilgrims in 15 days on their own from extremely remote and inaccessible areas. Before Army or Air Force called in, being deployed in the nearby areas, ITBP took the first call and saved many lives. They also distributed food packets to stranded pilgrims who were in a pathetic condition being not having any food for more than 72 hours at many places.[citation needed] Even TDP Supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu hurried to Dehradun by a special aircraft to undertake rescue operations for pilgrims in the state. He carried 196 stranded pilgrims back to safety and arranged buses for their commute back to their destinations. In order to inform the families of the stranded and missing people in Uttarakhand, the party had established a phone centre at the NTR Trust Bhavan in Hyderabad. At the stations in Secunderabad, Kazipet, and Vijaywada, the party has also established information and assistance desks.[49]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "The Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas and announced \u20b910 billion (US$120\u00a0million) aid package for disaster relief efforts in the state.[50] Several state governments announced financial assistance, with Uttar Pradesh pledging \u20b9250 million (US$3.0\u00a0million),[51] the governments of Haryana,[52] Maharashtra[53] and Delhi \u20b9100 million (US$1.2\u00a0million) each, the governments of Tamil Nadu,[54] Odisha,[55] Gujarat,[56] Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh \u20b950 million (US$600,000) each.[57]  The US Ambassador to India extended a financial help of US$150,000 through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to the NGOs working in the area [58] and announced that the US will provide further financial aid of US$75,000. The help was later politely rejected by Government of India.[58] The Government of Kerala offered 20 million rupees and all ministers offered one month's salary.[59][57] The Government of India also cancelled 9 batches, or half the annual batches of the Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra, a Hindu pilgrimage.[60] The Chardham Yatra pilgrimage, covering Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath was cancelled for 2 years to repair damaged roads and infrastructure, according to the Uttarakhand Government.[61] Government agencies and priests of Kedarnath temple were planning mass cremation of the hundreds of victims, after one week of tragedy.[62][63] Local youths from several affected villages near Gangotri helped stranded tourists and pilgrims, by sending messages to their places and by providing food.[64] Rescuers also retrieved approximately \u20b910 million (US$120,000) and other jewellery from local persons, including some people dressed like sadhu babas, who reportedly collected it from a destroyed building of a Bank and damaged shops.[65][66][67] Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) was given the responsibility of Rebuilding Kedarnath. Although the institute did not have the expertise in urban planning or construction, they mastered high-altitude training. Under the leadership of Colonel Ajay Kothiyal, the NIM was successful in rebuilding Kedarnath.c[citation needed]",
      "Climate and environmental factors[edit]": "A study by Utah State University[68] analyzed the natural and anthropogenic influences on the climate anomalies using simulations, and found that (a) northern India has experienced increasingly large rainfall in June since the late 1980s, (b) the increase in rainfall appears to be associated with a tendency in the upper troposphere towards amplified short waves, and (c) the phasing of such amplified short waves is tied to increased loading of green-house gases and aerosols. In addition, a regional modeling diagnosis attributed 60\u201390\u00a0% of rainfall amounts in the June 2013 event to post-1980 climate trends.[citation needed] Unprecedented destruction  the rainfall witnessed in Uttarakhand state was also attributed, by environmentalists, to unscientific developmental activities undertaken in recent decades contributing to high level of loss of property and lives. Roads constructed in haphazard style, new resorts and hotels built on fragile river and more than 70 hydroelectric projects in the watersheds of the state led to a \"disaster waiting to happen\" as termed by certain environmentalists.[69] The environmental experts reported that the tunnels built and blasts undertaken for the 70 hydro electric projects contributed to the ecological imbalance in the state, with flows of river water restricted and the streamside development activity contributing to a higher number of landslides and more flooding.[5][69]",
      "In popular culture[edit]": "A novel titled A Long Journey was written and published by independent author Pawan Kumar Pandey, who has the floods and the resulting tragedy in his background.[70][71]\nThe 2018 film Kedarnath starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khan tells of a love story set in the times of the disaster in the valley around the Kedarnath Temple.[72]",

      "2015 Northern Chile floods and mudflow": " The 2015 Northern Chile floods were a series of mudflows that affected much of northern Chile, product of flash floods from different rivers due to unseasonal heavy rains in the area, causing severe damage in several towns of the Antofagasta, Atacama and Coquimbo regions.[1][2]\nFlooding in Chile and Peru resulted from an unusual cold front which moved across the Andes, bringing heavy rainfall to the region.[3] The National Office of Emergency of the Interior Ministry (ONEMI) has reported more than 27,413 people affected, 5,585 people on shelters and more than 300 isolated due to roads destruction.[4][5]\n26 people died during the mudflow and 101 are officially missing, although it is expected that these numbers will increase as contact is reestablished with remote communities.[6]\nPreliminary figures show that property damage reaches more than 28,000 houses, of those 105 are completely destroyed, and at least 5,900 present severe damages.[7]",
      "State of emergency[edit]": "On March 25, near the 17:00 (UTC 3) hours, and due to the serious events due to flooding, the president of Chile, Michelle Bachelet declared Constitutional State of Exception Catastrophe throughout the Region of Atacama, where about 320,000 people, mainly settled in the cities of Copiap\u00f3 and reside Vallenar. This state means that the Armed Forces of Chile take control of the area to protect and maintain public order in the affected area. The officer in charge is Chief Lieutenant Colonel Marcel Urrutia Caro, belonging to the Army Chile. Hours later a state of emergency was extended to the city of Antofagasta. President Michelle Bachelet is in the areas affected by floods since March 25. Cha\u00f1aral visited on March 26, and that same day was decreed curfew across the Atacama region since 23:00 to 6:00 hours (UTC \u22123) . The March 26 were deployed Marines in Cha\u00f1aral to contain looting registered in some shops during the day. The authorities and citizens reported cases of speculation and hoarding of food and staples. The go government announced a lawsuit against those conducting unjustified price increases, and in supermarkets and service stations rationed the sale of certain products and fuels. In La Serena and Coquimbo the stock of bottled water scarcity product sold out due to problems in processing water Elqui river. The Chilean Navy sent to the port of Cha\u00f1aral the Rancagua and Chacabuco barges emergency vehicles, supplies and Marines, along with the ship Sergeant Aldea. The government allocated 1.1 billion Chilean peso for the reconstruction.",

      "Storm Eunice": " Storm Eunice (/\u00cb\u02c6ju\u00cb\ufffdn\u00c9\u00aas/) (known as Storm Zeynep in Germany and Storm Nora in Denmark) was an extremely powerful extratropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds that was part of the 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2022 European windstorm season. Storm Eunice was named by the UK Met Office on 14 February 2022. A red weather warning was issued on 17 February for parts of South West England and South Wales, with a second red warning issued on 18 February, the day the storm struck, for London, the South East and East of England. Eunice set a new record for the fastest wind gust recorded in England with 122 miles per hour (196\u00a0km/h) at The Needles, Isle of Wight. The storm was one of the most powerful to impact the south coast of England since the Great Storm of 1987.[7] The storm caused a huge amount of damage in parts of Western, Central and Northern Europe; millions of people were left without power across affected areas, and many homes had sustained damage. The UK was particularly hard hit, with 1.4 million homes left without power at its peak. Several other countries were struck hard by Eunice, with wind damage being mostly the cause of it. Heavy winds damaged parts of buildings, and wind gusts in excess of 120 miles per hour (190\u00a0km/h) were recorded. Eunice caused 17 fatalities, and multiple injuries.",
      "Meteorology[edit]": "The Met Office named Storm Eunice (as well as Storm Dudley) on 14 February;[8][9] the Free University of Berlin (FUB) named the same storm \"Zeynep\" on 16 February.[10] Storm Eunice formed on 17 February on a complex cold front situated west of Azores.[11] It rapidly deepened later on 17 February being driven along the right entrance region of the upper-level jet.[11] Met \u00c3\u2030ireann of Ireland tweeted that the rapid pressure drop during cyclogenesis met the criteria for explosive cyclogenesis.[12][13] The storm also developed a sting jet similarly to the Great Storm of 1987.[14]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Belgium[edit]": "The roof of the Ghelamco Arena was damaged, resulting in the postponement of the First Division A match between Gent and Seraing scheduled for 18 February.[15] In Tournai, parts of a crane were torn loose and fell on a hospital, damaging the roof and top floor.[16] The town centre of Asse had to be evacuated due to the risk of a church tower collapsing.[17] Public transport was temporarily suspended in large parts of Flanders, with NMBS and De Lijn both announcing trains, buses, and trams were scrapped. Thalys services between Brussels and Amsterdam were also cancelled.[18][19] Two ships ran adrift off the Belgian coast. The cargo ship Diamond Sky drifted through two offshore wind farms, but arrived at its final destination in the Netherlands without sustaining any damage. The Maersk Nimbus oil tanker was forced to lie at anchor in the C-Power offshore wind farm until its rescue by tugboats the next day.[20][21] Two people died as a result of the heavy winds. In Ypres, a 79-year-old British man drowned after falling from his boat at the marina. In Ghent, a man was hit by a broken solar panel and died in a hospital the next day.[21] At least three others were seriously injured. In Menen, an 18-year-old jogger was taken to a hospital in critical condition after being hit by a loose branch. In Temse, a man sustained a major head injury after a metal plate was ripped off a construction site container. In Veurne, a truck driver was hospitalized after their truck was overturned.[22][23] The highest wind gust measured in Belgium during the storm was 144\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph) in Knokke-Heist.[citation needed]",
      "Czech Republic[edit]": "The storm had left 26,000 homes without power and several railway lines in the country were suspended.[24]",
      "Denmark[edit]": "The Danish Meteorological Institute decided to give the storm the name Nora, believing the name Eunice would be difficult to pronounce in Nordic languages.[25] Nora did not cause significant damage to Denmark, and most models suggest Nora hit it with wind speeds of 60~70\u00a0km/h (37~43\u00a0mph). They also suggested Nora hit Southern Jutland the most, particularly near the German border as this was where Nora was closest to Denmark from Germany.[26] The highest wind recorded during the storm was 146\u00a0km/h (91\u00a0mph) in H\u00c3\u00b8jer.[citation needed]",
      "France[edit]": "In France, an orange warning was issued in 5 departments, with 140\u00a0km/h (87\u00a0mph) winds anticipated in the northernmost points of France, however the peak was 176\u00a0km/h (109\u00a0mph) at Cap Gris Nez.[27] Nord, Pas-de-Calais, Somme, Seine-Maritime, and Manche all received orange weather warnings, and yellow weather warnings were issued for most of Northern France. Police in Wimereux were reported to have been patrolling the seafront ensuring nobody walked on it.[28] Six people were seriously injured in the Nord department of France. Up to 160,000 households were left without electricity throughout the country. Regional trains in Hauts-de-France and Normandy were suspended, and the Lille-Flandres station was temporarily evacuated after debris fell on the glass roof.[29][30]",
      "Germany[edit]": "In Germany, Eunice was named Zeynep by the FUB, ahead of the system's impact storm tide warnings were issued near the Elbe river in preparation for 90\u00a0mph (145\u00a0km/h) winds, higher than Ylenia which impacted the area only days prior. Eunice made landfall at about midday local time, close to the mouth of the Elbe. Two people died in separate car accidents in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia in connection with the storm, authorities said.[31][32] A man died after falling when trying to repair a damaged roof near Cuxhaven, Lower Saxony in the municipality of Wurster Nordseek\u00c3\u00bcste.[33][34] In Hamburg, a storm surge up the River Elbe reached 3.75m.[35] A 55-meter crane collapsed on an under-construction office building in Bremen.[citation needed][36] A post mill at Klettbach, Thuringia was blown down. Photographs show that the main post had snapped where the quarterbars join and the mill had blown over onto its side.[37] It is hoped that the mill can be rebuilt.[38] First estimations expect an insured damage of 900 million Euros.[2] The highest wind gust measured in Germany was 145.8\u00a0km/h (90.6\u00a0mph) at Brocken.[39]",
      "Ireland[edit]": "On 16 February, Met \u00c3\u2030ireann issued a Status Orange wind warning for seven counties for 18 February, saying the storm would bring severe and potentially damaging winds, gusting up to 130\u00a0km/h.[40] The next day, further weather warnings for rain, wind and snow were issued by Met \u00c3\u2030ireann, with a Status Red wind warning for counties Cork, Kerry, Clare and Waterford, while all schools, colleges, universities and childcare facilities were advised to close in counties with Status Red wind and Orange snow warnings.[41][42] A number of flights, ferry crossings, bus and train services were cancelled throughout the country.[43] A gust of wind with a speed of 172 kilometres per hour (107\u00a0mph) was recorded offshore at Fastnet Lighthouse,[44] while a gust of 137 kilometres per hour (85\u00a0mph) was recorded at Roche's Point, Cork Harbour.[45] Up to 80,000 homes and businesses were without power nationally.[46] In County Wexford, a 59-year-old council worker was killed by a falling tree while out clearing debris.[47][48] There were reports of damages to the roof of Clontarf Road DART station.[49]",
      "Lithuania[edit]": "The storm caused power outages across Lithuania on 19 February, mostly in the western and central regions. The water level in the river Dan\u00c4\u2014\u00a0[lt] in Lithuania's port town Klaip\u00c4\u2014da rose rapidly and flooded streets in the city centre, and shipping in the region had to be stopped. According to representatives of Klaip\u00c4\u2014da Port, wind gusts reached 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) and is expected to rise up to 100\u00e2\u20ac\u201c108\u00a0km/h (62\u00e2\u20ac\u201c67\u00a0mph). Maximum recorded wave height was 5 meters (16 feet).[50]",
      "Luxembourg[edit]": "The storm caused flight disruptions at Findel Airport, where some flights were cancelled, and wind gusts of up to 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) were forecasted.[51]",
      "Netherlands[edit]": "The meteorological institute KNMI issued rare code red warnings as a result of Storm Eunice for Zeeland, South Holland, North Holland, Friesland and IJsselmeer regions. A code orange was in effect for the rest of the country, excluding Limburg, which faced only a code yellow warning.[52] KNMI reported that they expected gusts between 100 and 120\u00a0km/h for inland areas. This is the fourth time a code red has been issued since 2021 in the Netherlands, with the last in July 2021.[53] Dutch railway operator NS announced on 17 February that it was cancelling all domestic and international train traffic on 18 February at 14:00 CET (13:00 UTC).[54] Many universities and schools closed their doors in the afternoon of 18 February. In addition, national retailers, courts and town halls stopped services across the country in the afternoon.[55] The Eredivisie match between Fortuna Sittard and Sparta Rotterdam scheduled for the evening of 18 February was postponed as the safety of players, staff and supporters could not be guaranteed due to the extreme weather conditions in the area.[56] On 18 February, four people were killed in accidents involving fallen trees. Two people died in Amsterdam after being struck by a falling tree; one of them was a cyclist.[57] A driver in Diemen was struck and killed by a falling tree as well.[58][59][60] A fourth person died in Adorp near Groningen, after colliding with a fallen tree in their car.[61] The roof of the ADO Den Haag Stadium was damaged.[62] In the early evening of 18 February, several houses in The Hague were evacuated following reported instability in one of the two towers of the Elandkerk\u00a0[nl] in the town's Zeeheldenkwartier neighbourhood.[63][64] The storm also caused wind meters far more inland to register high wind gusts. In Cabauw, Utrecht, a wind gust of 145\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph) was measured.[65]",
      "Poland[edit]": "Four people including two car drivers and two passers-by were killed and nine people injured. The storm brought down thousands of trees, and blocked road and rail transport (mainly in Pomerania, Mazovia, Greater Poland, Warmia and Masuria). PKP IC trains suffered from cancellations and delays of more than 400 minutes.[66] More than 1.2 million people remained without electricity. More than 5,000 buildings were damaged. The 112 emergency phone number was overloaded. There were more than 180,000 emergency calls and more than 25,000 emergency actions, mainly regarding fallen trees, severed electricity lines or damaged roofs. Some skyscrapers in Warsaw were damaged.[67] The highest gusts were recorded on the morning of 19 February in the Baltic port of \u00c5\ufffdeba (119\u00a0km/h) and on \u00c5\u0161nie\u00c5\u00bcka mountain (162\u00a0km/h).[68]",
      "United Kingdom[edit]": "Eunice caused at least \u00c2\u00a3360 million worth of damage in the UK.[1] Weather warnings for wind, ice and rain were issued by the Met Office spanning most of the UK on 17 February: these warnings included red warnings, because of a danger to life from flying debris, across Wales and Southern England.[69][70][71] People living on the north coasts of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset in South West England were warned to expect flooding, hence the \"danger to life\" red warning.[72] Soon after, South East England, East of England and London were issued a red warning. Schools were widely closed,[73][74] along with public facilities (e.g. libraries),[75] delivery services,[76] sea crossings,[77] and several bridges.[78] The Humber Bridge, Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and the Orwell Bridge were closed; the closure of the Severn Bridge and the Prince of Wales Bridge made it the first time that both Severn bridges have been closed simultaneously, and the first time the Prince of Wales bridge had been closed due to wind.[79] The Langstone Bridge closed for almost three hours over fears of high tide surges, cutting off Hayling Island as the only road to and from the settlement.[80] The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said that the army had been placed on \"standby\".[78] Authorities across the country were inundated with phone calls related to the storm, with some having to ask the public only to dial 999 if there was a risk to life. London Fire Brigade declared a major incident \u00e2\u20ac\u201c receiving 1,958 calls on Friday, three times more than the previous day. The ambulance service in the South Central England region declared a critical incident due to demand on its emergency services.[81] A gust of wind with a speed of 122 miles per hour (196\u00a0km/h) was recorded at The Needles, Isle of Wight, the fastest gust ever recorded in England, though unofficially, 40 minutes after the reading was taken, the wind gust hit 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[62][82][83] There were several casualties, including three fatalities. One person in Waterloo was injured by falling debris; another in Streatham was injured by a falling tree.[84] Three people were taken to hospital after a car hit a tree in Bradford-upon-Avon. One person was hospitalised with serious injuries after being hit by debris from a roof in Henley-on-Thames.[85] An elderly man was injured when a section of roof was blown off the Bournemouth Sands Hotel in Westbourne.[86] Police in Highgate, north London, said they were called to reports of a tree falling on a car at 16:00 GMT. The woman, a passenger, was pronounced dead at the scene, while the driver, a man in his 30s, was taken to hospital. The man killed in Merseyside was a passenger in a car heading towards Aintree at about 14:10 when debris reportedly hit the windscreen, police said. Paramedics treated him at the scene, but he was pronounced dead. The driver was not injured. In Alton, Hampshire, two men were in a pickup truck when it was crushed by a falling tree. The passenger was pronounced dead at the scene while the driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries.[81] In London, large sections of The O2 Arena's fabric roof were torn away.[87][88] Two lorries overturned on the M4 westbound between Margam and Port Talbot.[89] The storm blew the top of the spire off Church of St Thomas, Wells, Somerset.[90] The de Havilland Venom display plane outside Grove Business Park, Wantage, Oxfordshire collapsed in high winds. In Reading, The Cartwheeling Boys statue collapsed in a pile of rubble.[91] One of the three towers at Grain Power Station collapsed,[62][92] and the power station was taken offline for safety.[93] The early 21st century bandstand at the De La Warr Pavilion on Bexhill-on-Sea seafront in East Sussex was destroyed.[94] Cladding on a Leeds tower block was ripped off.[95] Preston Railway Station was evacuated after the roof suffered structural damage. The station was subsequently deemed unsafe, with Network Rail warning passengers to avoid it. It was partially reopened the next day, with only three of the six platforms in use.[96] A part of the lion enclosure\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fence at Africa Alive! in Kessingland, Suffolk was smashed by a fallen tree.[97] A block of flats in Gosport had its roof ripped off by the storm.[98] Cladding on Evenlode Tower at Blackbird Leys in Oxford also came loose.[99] A water pipe burst at Hove Lagoon in Brighton and Hove, re-flooding it after it was emptied for cleaning and possibly costing the owner thousands of pounds.[100] It is thought that on Friday 18 February there was a record number of homes without power, at around 1.4 million homes.[3][101] 90,000 homes in South West England were left without power.[102] In Cornwall, power outages affected Bossiney, Lanarth, Marazion and Trevarrack.[102] Dorset was heavily affected by the storm.[103] The Sandbanks Ferry service was suspended.[104] Buildings in Pokesdown were damaged,[105] and a power cut affected Tower Park.[106] The Isle of Portland recorded a gust of 90 miles per hour (140\u00a0km/h), which was the highest wind speed recorded on mainland Britain during the storm.[107] An EFL Championship game between AFC Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest scheduled for the evening of 18 February was postponed because of damage to Bournemouth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ground, the Vitality Stadium, caused by the storm.[108] Trains were cancelled and delayed across the UK (including the complete cancellation of services in Wales).[109]  More than 430 flights due to take off or land at UK airports were cancelled on Friday.[110] Landings at Heathrow Airport of incoming aircraft attempting to land at the airport, including numerous go-arounds and touch-and-go landings, were live-streamed on the YouTube channel Big Jet TV, leading to global media coverage.[111][112][113] On 19 February, a yellow warning was issued in southern Wales and the coast of South West England for wind and another for ice in Flintshire.[114] The Prince of Wales Bridge was reopened, however the Severn Bridge remained closed due to forecast of high winds.[115] As of 20 February, there were still 83,000 homes without power across the United Kingdom: 29,000 in South West England; 23,000 in South East England; 20,000 in South England; 7,000 in Eastern England; and around 3,000 in South Wales.[3] On 20 February, Storm Franklin was named by the Met Office, and was expected to hamper recovery efforts from Storm Eunice. However, the storm was not as intense as Storm Eunice.[116]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Hurricane Betsy (1956)": " Hurricane Betsy, known as Hurricane Santa Clara in Puerto Rico, was the first North Atlantic hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico in 24\u00a0years. The third tropical cyclone of the 1956 Atlantic hurricane season, Betsy developed from a tropical wave on August\u00a09 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It rapidly developed into a 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) major hurricane before striking Guadeloupe. There, Betsy heavily damaged 1000\u00a0houses and left severe crop destruction, and there were 18\u00a0deaths in the territory. As Betsy continued into the northeastern Caribbean, it capsized a ship, killing its crew of two. On August\u00a012, Betsy struck southeastern Puerto Rico and quickly crossed the island. Damage was heaviest where it moved ashore and in the territory's central portion, and throughout Puerto Rico there were 15,023\u00a0houses that were destroyed by Betsy. Multiple locations reported heavy crop damage, including Camuy which reported a complete loss of the corn crop. Hurricane Betsy was the first hurricane to be observed from the San Juan radar, and also resulted in the first hurricane warning on the island to be released on television. The hurricane left $40\u00a0million in damage and 16\u00a0deaths, which prompted a federally declared disaster area. Locally the hurricane was known as the Santa Clara Hurricane. After exiting Puerto Rico, Betsy brushed the Bahamas before turning northeastward, becoming extratropical on August\u00a018. The remnants dissipated two days later to the south of Newfoundland.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Before Betsy's formation, the northeastward shift of the Azores High allowed for an increase in atmospheric instability across the tropical Atlantic, which made conditions for tropical cyclogenesis more favorable in early August.[1] A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August\u00a04.[2] On August\u00a09, a ship reported rough seas and winds of force\u00a010 on the Beaufort scale.[1] On that basis, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Betsy developed that day about 835\u00a0mi (1,344\u00a0km) east of Barbados.[3] The next day, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h), which indicated that Betsy had intensified significantly overnight. The flight reported how small the hurricane was, including a 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) wide eye.[1] After maintaining that intensity for about 24\u00a0hours, Betsy began weakening,[3] moving directly over Marie-Galante and southern Guadeloupe.[1] It entered the eastern Caribbean with winds of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) before it began a track to the west-northwest.[3] On August\u00a012, Hurricane Betsy passed about 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km) south of Saint Croix before striking southeastern Puerto Rico.[1] This made Betsy the first hurricane to strike the island since the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane.[4] It crossed the central portion of the island, and the structure deteriorated and the eye became difficult to locate as Betsy crossed the highest mountains.[4] On two occasions the eye dropped slightly to the south because of the mountains.[2] The eye became well-defined as it approached the coast,[4] and Betsy emerged on the northwest coast near Camuy at a similar intensity as when it moved ashore.[1] The hurricane re-intensified as it moved toward the Bahamas, reaching winds of 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a013.[3] That day, the eye passed near Grand Turk Island and San Salvador Island. By that time, the storm had increased in size; the Hurricane Hunters reported that the gale-force winds extended 125\u00a0mi (201\u00a0km) to its north. The eye reformed on August\u00a014, becoming well-organized and attaining a minimum barometric pressure of 960\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg). The next day, Betsy turned to the northeast due to an approaching trough.[1] Despite beginning a weakening trend, the pressure dropped further to 954\u00a0mbar (28.2\u00a0inHg) on August\u00a017.[3] The eye became increasingly poorly defined,[1] and Betsy weakened to a tropical storm on August\u00a018 to the south of Nova Scotia. Turning to the east, it became extratropical later that day, eventually dissipating on August\u00a020.[3]",
      "Impact[edit]": "When the first advisory was issued on Betsy, a hurricane watch was issued from Barbados to Antigua. Around that time, a hurricane watch was also issued for Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, which was later upgraded to a hurricane warning.[1] This was the first hurricane warning in Puerto Rico to be aired on television.[2] The hurricane struck Guadeloupe with winds from 100\u2013120\u00a0mph (160\u2013190\u00a0km/h), which caused extensive damage to 1,000\u00a0houses. The communications throughout the territory were disrupted. The high winds destroyed upwards of 60% of the banana, breadfruit, coconut, and papaya crop, which severely impacted the economy. Across the French West Indies, the hurricane resulted in 18\u00a0deaths and caused $10\u00a0million in damage, $3.5\u00a0million of which from crop damage.[1] In nearby Dominica, winds reached 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h).[2] In Saint Croix, the hurricane dropped 3.20\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm),[4] while winds reached 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h).[2] In the northeastern Caribbean, Betsy capsized a ship and killed its crew of two. Another ship in the region drifted for several days south of Saint Croix due to a damaged engine.[5] When Betsy crossed Puerto Rico, it produced hurricane-force winds across the entire territory except in the southwest corner. Sustained winds reached 73\u00a0mph (117\u00a0km/h) in San Juan, and Ramey Air Force Base on the island's northwestern portion recorded 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) wind gusts.[1] The high winds downed a significant number of trees in the island's interior due to the funneling within valleys. In Aibonito, the winds destroyed 1000\u00a0houses and damaged another 500, and in nearby Comer\u00edo the winds severely damaged or destroyed 1285\u00a0dwellings. In Jayuya in the central portion of the island, the hurricane left severe crop damage, including a complete loss to the banana crop. However, damage was heaviest in Yabucoa near where Betsy moved ashore,[5] due to a slight oscillation of the eye. High winds caused severe damage in a 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) radius.[2] In Yabucoa, over 12,000\u00a0people were left homeless, and damage totaled $8\u00a0million. Damage was likewise severe where Betsy moved offshore in Camuy, with a complete loss to the corn crop, 95% of the avocado, 65% of breadfruit, and 50% of the coffee crop ruined.[5] The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall in the central portion of the island,[4] with a peak 24\u2011hour total of 8.72\u00a0in (221\u00a0mm) in R\u00edo Grande.[2] The same station recorded a total of 9.07\u00a0in (230\u00a0mm), which was the highest total related to Betsy's passage.[6] Across Puerto Rico, Betsy destroyed 15,023\u00a0houses and left $40\u00a0million in damage. There were sixteen deaths on the island,[1] which was less than expected due to well-heeded warnings.[5] There were also 24\u00a0injuries in the territory related to the storm.[7] Betsy was the first hurricane on record to be observed from the San Juan radar.[4] On the island, it is known as the Santa Clara hurricane.[2] Due to the damage, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower declared Puerto Rico as a disaster area on August\u00a018, which allocated millions of dollars in assistance.[7][8] The Puerto Rican governor allocated $6.7\u00a0million of funding to aid in rebuilding.[7] In San Salvador in the Bahamas, the hurricane produced wind gusts of 132\u00a0mph (212\u00a0km/h), and sustained winds reached 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h). The storm dropped about 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) of rainfall. Betsy destroyed several houses and wrecked the roofs of several churches. Hurricane Betsy left about $380,000 in damage in the Bahamas.[1] While delivering relief supplies to San Salvador Air Force Base, a Douglas C-124A-DL Globemaster II operated by the U.S. Air Force crashed. The plane had a right landing gear fail and as the result the plane skidded down the runway and came to a stop. One person was killed.[9] Due to uncertainty in the storm's movement, officials issued a hurricane warning for southern Florida. Although Betsy remained far away from the state, its eye was observed on radar in Miami at a potentially record distance of 337\u00a0mi (542\u00a0km).[1] In the Grand Banks offshore Canada, the hurricane sunk a ship, although the entire crew was rescued.[10]",

      "February 9\u201311, 2017 North American blizzard": "The February 9\u201311, 2017 North American blizzard was a fast-moving but powerful blizzard that affected the Northeastern United States with winter weather in the time span of February 8\u20139. Forming as an Alberta clipper in the northern United States, the system initially produced light snowfall from the Midwest to the Ohio Valley as it tracked southeastwards. It eventually reached the East Coast of the United States and began to rapidly grow into a powerful nor'easter. Up to 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) of snow as well as blizzard conditions were recorded in some of the hardest hit areas before the system moved away from the coastline early on February 10. Prior to the blizzard, unprecedented and record-breaking warmth had enveloped the region, with record highs of above 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C) recorded in several areas, including Central Park in New York City. Some were caught off guard by the warmth and had little time to prepare for the snowstorm, with some meteorologists calling the extreme weather changes \"unprecedented\".",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On February 6, an Alberta clipper developed near the Canada\u2013United States border and dove southeastwards.[2] With relatively little moisture to supply it, initial snowfall totals in the Plains and Midwest were light, ranging from 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6\u00a0cm). The system quickly advanced eastwards through the heart of the country, and by 18:00\u00a0UTC on February 8, a surface low had developed over the Arkansas\u2013Tennessee state border.[3] This low would become the dominant low of the system as it continued towards the Northeastern United States, while also producing light to moderate snow across the Ohio Valley since there was enough cold air in place from a departing storm system. As the clipper system neared the tri-state area, it began to steadily intensify and produce more moderate and heavy snow while beginning to make the transition into a nor'easter. By 09\u201312:00\u00a0UTC on February 9, the low had begun to move just offshore near the Delaware coastline.[4][5] As very heavy snow bands (with snowfall rates of 2\u20134 inches (5.1\u201310.2\u00a0cm) in some spots) set up offshore, forecasters noted that the low was likely to rapidly deepen \u2013 or in meteorological terms, bomb out \u2013 due to the temperature contrast between the cold air to its north and moisture feeding into the storm from the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.[6] Indeed, the storm had undergone this process, meeting the criteria for bombogenesis, with the central pressure dropping from 1,005 millibars (29.7\u00a0inHg) at 18:00\u00a0UTC on February 8 to 977 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) by 18:00\u00a0UTC on February 9 while it was offshore the New Jersey coastline.[7] Snow slowly began to subside in areas such as eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey. The storm system was absorbed by another system forming off the coast of Greenland on February 11.",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "On February 8, winter storm warnings were issued for much of the Northeast, including a blizzard warning for parts of Long Island.[8] More than 2,400 flights were cancelled across the affected regions.[9]",
      "New York[edit]": "On February 8, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that schools in New York City would be closed the following day, due to the impending snowstorm.[10] Advising residents to stay indoors and stay off the roads, Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia stated, \"This will be a very dangerous storm. Luckily it\u2019s not likely to last very long, only a few hours, but during the period of time that it\u2019s coming down it\u2019ll be extraordinarily difficult to drive. So I want to encourage everyone who can take mass transit to please do that.\" To also avoid a disaster that had happened the year before where several residents were trapped even after the snow subsided due to plows being unable to access certain roads, several smaller equipment and trucks were bought in order to plow the streets in the aftermath.[10] About 2,300 salt spreaders and plows were prepared to plow the streets as of early February 9.[11] Regarding the sudden change from record-high temperatures to a snowstorm, Mayor Bill de Blasio cited that it was \"unlike anything [I've] seen in my life. What almost feels like a summer day almost, now, and tomorrow a blizzard.\"[11] Slick roads were responsible for two jackknifed MTA buses early on February 9 in Manhattan, however no injuries were reported.[12][13] In Long Island, a tractor trailer was involved in an accident with multiple vehicles. No injuries were reported. Blizzard-like conditions were also observed in areas mainly near the freeways such as Interstate 95. One death was confirmed when a 59-year old doorman slipped and fell through a glass door in New York City on East 93rd Street, causing injuries to his face and neck. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.[12][14]",
      "Connecticut[edit]": "Interstate 95 was shut down in both directions on February 9 due to reports of several vehicles stuck on both sides of the road.[12] The Connecticut State Police advised residents on Twitter to \"please stay home if possible\". Bradley International Airport also closed due to the snowstorm,[15] as well as several transit services being temporarily suspended.[12] Bradley International Airport realized their 4th snowiest calendar day on record with 15.5 inches (39\u00a0cm) of snow.[16] On Interstate 95, multiple sections were also closed due to one report of a jackknifed tractor trailer in West Haven early on February 9. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined.[12][17] Another section was closed due to a three-vehicle accident on the southbound lanes of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge.[12]",
      "Rhode Island[edit]": "A state legislative meeting between Representatives and Senators was reportedly cancelled as well as all legislative meetings on February 9.[9] Travel and parking bans were also put into place in many towns, including Providence, as well as the cancellations of most schools. Blizzard conditions were recorded in at least four locations in Rhode Island, including Block Island, North Smithfield, Providence, and Westerly. The criteria for blizzard conditions are met when falling and/or blowing snow drops visibility to 0.25\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) or less, and sustained winds reach at least 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) for at least three hours.[18]",
      "Massachusetts[edit]": "Schools in Boston were closed because of the storms. Governor Charlie Baker announced on February 8 a two-hour delay for any non-emergency state employees, in order for crews to quickly treat roads and respond to any crashes that occur.[9][19] Blizzard conditions were recorded in at least eight locations in Massachusetts, including Beverly, Boston, Chatham, Hyannis, Marshfield, Martha's Vineyard, New Bedford, and Provincetown.[18]",
      "New Jersey[edit]": "Late on February 8, Governor Chris Christie announced that all state offices would be closed due to the snowstorm, advising workers to stay home.[20] Many schools were also closed as well. By mid-day on February 9, state police had informed news outlets that they had responded to around 145 crashes since midnight. A 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) speed limit was implemented on the Garden State Parkway from exit 125 to the northern state line.[12] Transit services were also suspended.[citation needed]",
      "Pennsylvania[edit]": "In Philadelphia, a snow emergency was declared late on February 8, stating that all parked cars had to be moved off the affected areas.[9][21] Snow across the Philadelphia metropolitan area was less than anticipated.[22]",
      "Canada[edit]": "In Atlantic Canada, accumulations of snow were reported between 10 and 30 centimetres (4 and 12\u00a0in) on February 9 and 10th with the maximum axis along Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Western Newfoundland.[23]",

      "2013 Argentina floods": " Between 1 and 3 April 2013, the northeastern section of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, experienced several flash floods that claimed the lives of 101 people. Greater La Plata was hardest hit with 91 reported deaths,[1] and Greater Buenos Aires reported 10 deaths.[2][3] The flooding was the result of extremely heavy rainfall and is said to be the worst flooding in La Plata's history. Three days of national mourning were declared on 3 April. Two days later, government benefits for flood victims were announced.",
      "Storm[edit]": "On the evening of Monday, 1 April 2013, a severe storm moved into the northeast of Buenos Aires Province. It began to rain heavily, peaking between 3:00 AM and 5:30 AM.[4] During the storm's peak, visibility was only 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft).[4] In total, the storm dumped between 160 and 190\u00a0mm (6.3 and 7.5\u00a0in) of rain on Buenos Aires, the heaviest April rainfall on record.[4] Buenos Aires city typically averages 96\u00a0mm (3.8\u00a0in) of rain for the entire month of April.[5] In nearby La Plata, the capital city of Buenos Aires Province, approximately 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rain fell over a two-hour time span on Tuesday evening.[6] The heavy rainfall led to flash floods and widespread power outages. In Greater La Plata, an estimated 3,000 people were evacuated, many after waiting hours for rescue in trees and on roof tops of flooded homes.[7][8] Half of the city lost power and vast portions were underwater.[5][6] TV footage of the disaster showed people wading through waist-deep water and cars almost completely underwater.[5] The city's oil refinery caught fire due to \"an extraordinary accumulation of rainwater and power outages\" and was shut down.[7] Flood waters encircled the La Plata suburb of Tolosa, rendering 50 vehicles immobile.[6] Santiago Martorelli, cabinet chief of La Plata partido (department), called the storm \"a catastrophe without precedent.\"[8] In Buenos Aires, more than a quarter of a million people were without power by Wednesday.[5] Key transportation routes were submerged, and mass transit services disabled.[4] A local reporter described the situation in Buenos Aires: \"A record torrential rainstorm unleashed all its might\u00a0... turning the city into a macabre version of Venice rather than the dry capital of Argentina.\"[4] Rain continued to fall throughout the region on 3 April, making the situation very bad.[4]",
      "Consequences[edit]": "In Buenos Aires city, power shortages lasted as long as 15 hours in at least 11 Barrios (neighborhoods), affecting 70,000 households at its peak.[9][10] Two hospitals were among those who lost power in La Plata.[11] Buenos Aires Underground and rail systems were halted or limited.[12] The Chief of Government of Buenos Aires (city mayor), Mauricio Macri, was on vacation at the time of the flood, and returned in the evening.[4] The same situation was for La Plata's city mayor Pablo Bruera, who first falsely claimed that he was assisting the evacuated people during the floods.[13] President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner visited the affected area on 3 April surveying the damage by helicopter and meeting with victims in Tolosa, Greater La Plata, where she was born and raised; and Barrio Mitre, a villa miseria (slum) in Buenos Aires city northside.[14] Rescue efforts focused on finding victims still trapped in their homes to prevent further fatalities. Local charities sought donations of food, water, diapers and mattresses.[5] Hepatitis shots were available at evacuation centers, and four mobile hospitals were set up to treat victims and distribute food and water.[11] At that time, at least 51 people were known to have died in Greater La Plata, and six deaths had been reported in Buenos Aires.[5][15] Two additional deaths were reported in Greater Buenos Aires.[4] Many victims died by drowning, while others were electrocuted by downed power lines (including a Metro worker who was electrocuted in Los Incas station).[7][12] Many deaths in La Plata were not discovered until after the flood waters started to recede. \"The bodies began to appear as the water subsided,\" said the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Daniel Scioli.[6] Numerous families lost all their possessions in the floods, while shopkeepers reported losses of their merchandise.[5] Business losses were estimated at 530.6 million pesos (US$104 million).[16] Schools and government offices were closed across La Plata.[6] As of 4 April, there were reportedly still 20 people missing and 1,200 evacuated in La Plata.[17] More than two months later, it was officially reported that 78 was the number of deaths in Greater La Plata.[1] Politicians were quick to blame one another for the disaster. The Minister of Federal Planning and Public Utilities, Julio de Vido, claimed that Buenos Aires city officials knew that the rains were coming and had failed to prepare for them.[5] Macri, a vocal opponent of President Kirchner, accused the national government of preventing the city from getting World Bank loans to finance infrastructure improvements. According to official data, the government of the City of Buenos Aires Mauricio Macri had not implemented any development works in stormwater infrastructure, while related works Brook Maldonado, had only 14 percent of budget execution.[18][5][4] Residents of Barrio Mitre blamed the drainage system of a large shopping mall built nearby in 2009 for the heavy damage in their area.[19] On Wednesday afternoon and on Thursday morning, Kirchner met with Scioli to coordinate the rescue and emergency efforts in Greater La Plata.[15] Fear remained high as reports of looting and clashes with police officers spread.[11] The Argentine army mounted an industrial kitchen and ten field kitchens to prepare hot meals 8,000 and 1,500 cold rations per day.[20] Three days of national mourning were declared on 3 April.[8] On 5 April, Kirchner announced government benefits for the victims, including doubled pensions for some 70,000 elderly people and for an estimated 16,000 families receiving five other social subsidies, free replacement ID cards, new car licenses, and low-cost housing loans.[21]",
      "Causes[edit]": "The general causes of the floods were the absence of drainage works, the urban development without environmental control and climate change. As specific causes can be seen:[citation needed] According to a report based on official data that the Buenos Aires Government delivered each quarter, the Mayor of the city of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, made no inversion in stormwater infrastructure development works, while works annexed to the Maldonado stream are only 14% of the authorized budget.[22] A report issued in August 2012 by the Buenos Aires audit indicated that the works to reduce flooding in the neighborhoods of Belgrano, Villa del Parque, Villa Ortuzar, Agronom\u00eda and Parque Chas had been paralyzed for 3 years.[23]",

      "2015\u201316 North American winter": " The 2015\u201316 North American winter was not as frigid across North America and the United States (especially the East Coast) as compared to the 2013\u201314 and 2014\u201315 winters. This was mainly due to a strong El Ni\u00f1o, which caused generally warmer-than-average conditions. However, despite the warmth, significant weather systems still occurred, including a snowstorm and flash flooding in Texas at the end of December and a large tornado outbreak at the end of February. The main event of the winter season, by far and large, was when a crippling and historic blizzard struck the Northeastern United States in late January, dumping up to 3 feet (36\u00a0in; 91\u00a0cm) of snow in and around the metropolitan areas. Several other smaller snow events affected the Northeast as well, but for the most part the heaviest snowstorms and ice stayed out further west, such as a severe blizzard in western Texas in late December (producing a tornado outbreak as well), and  a major late-season snowstorm in Colorado in mid-April. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2015 occurred late on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2016 occurred on March 20.[1] Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 29.[2] Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. Since both definitions span the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm in two different years.",
      "Seasonal forecasts[edit]": "On October 15, 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center issued its U.S. Winter Outlook. The presence of a strong El Ni\u00f1o event was expected to affect weather and climate patterns by influencing the position of the Pacific jet stream. According to CPC deputy director Mike Halpert at the time of the outlook, \"A strong El Ni\u00f1o is in place and should exert a strong influence over our weather this winter\" and \"While temperature and precipitation impacts associated with El Ni\u00f1o are favored, El Ni\u00f1o is not the only player. Cold-air outbreaks and snow storms will likely occur at times this winter. However, the frequency, number and intensity of these events cannot be predicted on a seasonal timescale.\" Other oscillations anticipated to have some effect on winter in the United States were the Arctic oscillation and the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation. The precipitation outlook indicated an elevated likelihood of above-average levels precipitation from central and southern California to Texas and Florida and northward to southern parts of New England. Above-average precipitation was also favored in southeastern Alaska, with below-average levels of precipitation favored in central and western Alaska, parts of the Northwestern U.S. and northern Rocky Mountain states, and areas in the vicinity of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. The temperature outlook favored below-average temperatures in the southern Plains and Southeastern United States. Above-average temperatures were most favored across the West and the northern half of the contiguous United States and Alaska and Hawaii. The drought outlook anticipated improvement in conditions in central and southern California by the end of January 2016, noting the possibility of additional alleviation of drought conditions in February and March. The outlook favored the removal of drought across large parts of the Southwestern U.S., with additional lessening or elimination of drought conditions likely in the southern Plains. Drought conditions were expected to persist across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rocky Mountains, with development likely in Hawaii and areas in the vicinity of the northern Great Lakes region.[3] On November 30, 2015, Environment Canada issued its winter outlook for December, January, and February, as part of their monthly climate outlooks. Above-average temperatures were favoured throughout most of Canada, with the exception of northern Quebec and the southern tip of Baffin Island; areas that were considered the most likely to see above normal temperatures included the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, the Maritime provinces, southern Newfoundland, central Quebec and Ontario, and northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan; in those areas, the probability of above-normal temperatures was over 80%. The areas where below-normal temperatures were favoured included extreme northern areas of Quebec and Labrador, along with southern parts of Baffin Island. Above average precipitation was favoured in the Lower Mainland of B.C., New Brunswick, northern Quebec, northern Newfoundland, the Northwest Territories, and western Nunavut. Below-average precipitation was favoured on the south-eastern tip of Baffin Island and a small area just north of Lake Superior.[4]",
      "Seasonal summary[edit]": "The winter of 2015\u201316 was quite unusual and historic in terms of winter weather. First, around the end of November near Black Friday, a crippling ice storm hit the Southern and Central Plains with as much as 1.5 inches (38\u00a0mm) of ice accumulation in some areas, knocking out power to over 100,000 residents.[5] In December, two winter storms impacted the Great Lakes, with the latter one being a bit farther to the west, both brought roughly a foot of snow in some locations. Normally, in this area, this is not common, but the strong El Ni\u00f1o may have been a contributor to this. Following that, the nation had one of the warmest Decembers on record, with New York City being as warm as 72\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u00a0\u00b0C) on Christmas Eve (December 24).[6] This was the warmest temperature in New York City in the second half of December on record.[7] The low that day of 63\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C) was the warmest December low on record in New York.[8] In fact, across the Lower 48, this was the warmest and wettest December on record at the time. Every single state in the Northeastern United States saw a record warm December.[9]  In 2021, an even warmer December was recorded across the Lower 48, with a mean temperature of 39.3\u00a0\u00b0F (4.1\u00a0\u00b0C) rather than 38.6\u00a0\u00b0F (3.7\u00a0\u00b0C).[10] This meant Buffalo, New York until December 18, a record for latest first snow.[11] A strong tornado outbreak also occurred from December 23\u201325, which a very similar event had occurred the year before, just weaker.[12] After this system passed, a larger storm complex moved through the same areas impacted by the ice storm from Black Friday 2015. This storm brought blizzard conditions to parts of Texas and New Mexico, with areas reaching up to close to 2 feet of snow in parts of Texas, which is a rare event in that state.[13] For comparison, the last time this has occurred (or near the same areas), was in 2011 during the Groundhog Day blizzard. The month of January 2016 was variable in its weather patterns. Following the warm trend in December, an early cold snap brought close-to-average temperatures to the East Coast, at the same time a storm complex was moving through the Northeast, and due to the fresh batch of cold air, it was able to produce some snow on the back side of it.[14] At the opposite end of the spectrum, the West Coast was receiving needed rainfall to help during its long-time drought. This brief period of relief soon ended. After that, around January 16\u201317, a potent storm system moved up the East Coast, bringing the first snowfall of the season to areas like Philadelphia and New York City. A few days later, an Alberta clipper moved through the central United States, producing a swath of snow from Illinois to North Carolina. This small system was then proceeded and eclipsed by a crippling and historic blizzard just days later on January 22\u201323. Cities like Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City were buried with 1\u20132.5 feet (12\u201330\u00a0in) of snow, breaking numerous records.[15] In February, the historic weather events continued, as another snowstorm kicked off the month with a swath of snow from Colorado to Michigan. Snow accumulations ranged from 8\u201314 inches (20\u201336\u00a0cm), along with winds up to 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[16] After the storm system passed, its cold front transformed into another potent snowstorm for the East Coast, with snowfall amounts up to 8 inches.[17] From there, another winter storm occurred as a nor'easter, bringing more snow to New England on February 8.[18] Shortly thereafter, the coldest air of the season froze parts of the Northeast on February 14, with temperatures dipping to as low as 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C), shattering many record low temperatures.[19] The cold lingered into Presidents Day as another winter storm began to take shape. This set the stage for more snow in the Northeast. Snowfall ranged anywhere from 4\u20136 inches (10\u201315\u00a0cm) in the Northeast, to 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346\u00a0cm) in the Appalachians.[20] What was interesting about the weather pattern for this system, was the 24-hour weather difference, for example, at 2:00\u00a0pm EDT on February 15, New York City reported snow with temperatures in the 30s, and a day later, reported temperatures in the mid-50s and thunderstorms on February 16. The system departed by February 17. A week later around February 22\u201324, another winter storm formed and eventually produced the second-largest tornado outbreak ever recorded in February.[21] The storm complex produced as much as 59 confirmed tornadoes, with 4 of them being rated an EF3, including areas which don't normally see tornadoes that strong. The massive system moved out of the United States by February 25. March was quite extreme. Around March 10, an area of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere dove into Mexico, where it stalled for a few days, and caused some extreme and record-breaking weather events from March 7\u201310. Parts of the South were inundated with days of heavy rain, with areas receiving more than 18 inches of rain, leading to historic flash flooding.[22] At the same time, record-breaking temperatures pushed into the Northeast, with some areas reaching into the low 80s (which broke the record for earliest 80 degree day on record). The storm system also produced snow in Mexico, which rarely receives it at all. Around the spring equinox, winter was still not done. A weak nor'easter formed on March 20, and tracked up the East Coast later that day, producing a swath of snow up to 10 inches in some spots.[23] The nor'easter was predicted to be stronger than what was actually observed, but due to computer models, direction of the low pressure, and amount of cold air present made it difficult to precisely time the storm out. The storm then went on to enter the Arctic Ocean where it explosively deepened to a minimum of 949 millibars (28.0\u00a0inHg) on March 23. That same day, another winter storm began to produce blizzard conditions in the High Plains, and dropped up to 30 inches (76\u00a0cm) of snow in parts of the High Plains and the Great Lakes through March 23\u201325, along with bringing a significant ice storm to parts of New England, with accumulations of 0.25\u20130.75 inches (6.4\u201319.1\u00a0mm) of ice in some areas.[24] Even though winter was officially over, it felt like winter somewhat in the Northeast. An unusual cold blast occurred at the beginning of April, bringing temperatures 10\u201315\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212\u00a0\u2013 \u22129\u00a0\u00b0C) below average in the afflicted areas.[25] It was cold enough for snow in parts of New England, and as a result, several Alberta clippers began to track their way to the East Coast. The first clipper brought mainly high winds and snow showers to much of the Northeast early on April 3, with mainly high wind warnings being issued.[26] This system moved off rather quickly and immediately began undergoing bombogenesis, with its pressure dropping to 984 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg) by 12 UTC, less than 3 hours after the centre had moved off the coast. It then went to further deepen to a peak of 954 millibars (28.2\u00a0inHg) late on April 4. The next clipper system was weaker, but brought a swath of accumulating snow to the southeastern parts of New England. It later moved off late that night.[27] A third clipper system began to edge its way into the Great Lakes on April 6, and brought the risk for wildfires as well. It moved into Canada while transitioning into a storm complex on April 7. A fourth system then moved across nearly the same areas from April 8\u20139, bringing even more spring snow to the Mid-Atlantic states. This system actually intensified into a small nor'easter on April 9, and brought 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6\u00a0cm) of wet snow from the Ohio Valley into the Northeast. It moved off later that night, but brought some more cold air with it. Finally, the cold air retreated out of the region by April 11\u201312, as warm air began to surge back in. However, winter made one last comeback during the weekend of April 16\u201317, as an upper-level low stalled in the West, producing a major snowstorm that affected the High Plains and Rocky Mountains in areas near the Denver metropolitan area, dumping up to 4 feet (48\u00a0in) of heavy snow, which led to power outages.[28] The storm also produced record rainfall of up to 20 inches (51\u00a0cm), leading to severe flash floods. The system moved slowly eastward, as a developing Omega Block pattern was expected to bring extreme relief to the cold stricken Midwest and East Coast.",
      "Events[edit]": "",
      "Late November ice storm[edit]": "Around Black Friday of 2015, a major ice storm occurred in the Southern Central Plains, with areas receiving up to 1 inch (25\u00a0mm) of the frozen precipitation. Residents in the areas were without powers for days, if not weeks. The storm also brought snow to parts of the Midwest, with accumulations up to 1 foot (30\u00a0cm) of snow.[29] Historic rainfall also fell too, breaking numerous records.[30] \nOn November 25, an area of low pressure system moved through the West and central Midwest, dropping snow of up to 1 foot (30\u00a0cm),[29] and also brought the first cold blast of the winter season. At the same time, incoming moisture from weakening Hurricane Sandra in the East Pacific was starting to streak through Mexico into the southwestern United States. Interacting with the low pressure area, this combined to produce a plume of precipitation from ice to rain from southern Texas into Minnesota, due to high pressure situated off Maine keeping the Northeast dry for the holiday. While causing a potent ice storm on its cold side, on the warm sector of the system, severe floods occurred as well, with areas like McKinney in Texas receiving up to 10.53 inches (26.7\u00a0cm) of rain over a 4-day period, causing major flooding.[30] Some areas even broke their records for yearly rainfall totals from this system, due to the axis of moisture shooting into Canada.[30] In total, 17 people died, including six in Kansas, three in Texas, three in Missouri and one in Utah, and over 110,000 left without power, especially around Oklahoma City.[31]",
      "Post-Christmas storm complex[edit]": "Two days after Christmas, a large storm complex with snow, severe weather and heavy rainfall impacted the Southern Plains and southern Rocky Mountains, including all or parts of the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma. The system spawned tornadoes over central and eastern Texas and Oklahoma, while bringing blizzard conditions to the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, most areas in New Mexico, and southern Colorado. The main area of low pressure moved northeast from the southern Plains to the eastern Great Lakes, while a secondary low pressure system formed east of the Delmarva Peninsula on December 29.  After impacting New Mexico and the Texas panhandle with record snowfall, the storm system left a swath of snow and ice accumulation from western Oklahoma to Michigan.  On December 29, the storm system brought a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain to New York State and New England. On December 26, 2015, it affected parts of the Texas Panhandle and resulted in the formation of tornadoes in the Dallas area, including an EF4 which struck the Garland area that evening.[32][33][34]",
      "Late January blizzard[edit]": "A crippling and historic blizzard occurred from January 22\u201323 in the Mid-Atlantic states. The storm was given various unofficial names, including Winter Storm Jonas, Blizzard of 2016, and Snowzilla among others. The highest reported snowfall was 40 inches (100\u00a0cm) in Glengary, West Virginia. Locations in five states exceeded 30 inches (76\u00a0cm) of snow. The storm dropped 18 inches (46\u00a0cm) of snow in Washington, D.C., 22 inches in Philadelphia, 26 inches (66\u00a0cm) in Baltimore, 30.5 inches (77\u00a0cm) in New York City.[35][36][37] States of emergency were declared in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, Delaware, New York, and Washington, D.C.[38] The storm also caused coastal flooding in Delaware and New Jersey. Cape May, New Jersey set a record high water level at 8.98 feet (2.74\u00a0m), higher than the 8.90 feet (2.71\u00a0m) seen during Hurricane Sandy.[35] High winds led to blizzard conditions in many areas. Sustained winds of 59 miles per hour (95\u00a0km/h) with gust of 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) were recorded in Delaware. 70 miles per hour (110\u00a0km/h) gusts were also recorded in Massachusetts.[35]",
      "Early February winter storm[edit]": "A trailing low pressure system to the previous weeks' blizzard had developed offshore California on January 29. The low and accompanying precipitation moved onshore the next day. At the time blizzard conditions were expected. The storm moved eastward into the Great Plains where tremendous snowfall occurred. On February 1, another area of low pressure led to severe weather across the Southeastern United States. Multiple tornadoes were reported in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, including a large EF2 tornado. After the storm had passed, the cold front associated with it stalled over the East Coast late on February 4. A new low pressure developed off North Carolina that night and started to track up the coast. It impacted areas already hit hard by the previous blizzard about two weeks prior, and caused messy travel along Interstate 95 (Northeast). The storm brought a quick but moderate-to-heavy burst of steady snow, with some areas in New England receiving up to 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m).",
      "February nor'easter[edit]": "On February 7, an elongated area of low pressure developed offshore to the west of Florida. While moving inland, it produced a decent dose of rainfall to the Sunshine State as it moved to the northeast. Later the same day, it moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean and began to undergo bombogenesis, its pressure dropping from 1,004 millibars (29.6\u00a0inHg) at 7\u00a0a.m. EST February 7 to 979 millibars (28.9\u00a0inHg) at 1\u00a0a.m. EST February 8.[39] As it did so, it also began to transition into a nor'easter, as rainbands began to impact the eastern edges of North Carolina and South Carolina. There was some cold air aloft, allowing for a few areas of wet snow to develop further inland. As the cyclone continued to strengthen, it started to achieve the conditions of a bomb cyclone. Furthermore, the system started to form an eye compared to that of a typical Category 1 hurricane, however this was short-lived and dissolved a few hours later. Snowbands began to impact New England early in the morning of February 8, with some bands reaching up to snowfall rates of an inch per hour, especially near the coast. The outermost bands did not reach New Jersey and New York City, due to the nor'easter being far offshore. The storm continued to deepen for a few more hours before reaching its peak intensity of 976 millibars (28.8\u00a0inHg). The system then continued to weaken as it moved northward, before finally merging with another low pressure system on February 10 to the south of it which had also exited from the East Coast.",
      "Mid-February cold wave[edit]": "During mid-February, record-breaking cold temperatures swung across the Northeast United States and southeastern Canada.[40]  On 13 February 2016, Whiteface Mountain underwent a record windchill of \u2212114\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221281\u00a0\u00b0C),[41] while in Boston, Massachusetts, the temperature dropped to \u22129\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221223\u00a0\u00b0C), the coldest since 1957.  The windchill descended to \u221236\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221238\u00a0\u00b0C), surpassing the previous record by 6\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221214\u00a0\u00b0C).[42] In Toronto, Ontario, the NBA All-Star Weekend took place in temperatures of \u221223\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22129\u00a0\u00b0F) and wind chills near \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F), causing some players and visitors to complain about the cold.[43] The recorded temperatures were the coldest recorded since a very similar cold wave impacted the region exactly a year prior. In New York City, the temperature in Central Park gets below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) for the first time since January 19, 1994,[44] and the windchill at JFK Airport on February 14 at 6:30am hit \u221219\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221228\u00a0\u00b0C). The low of \u22121\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) set a record for the coldest Valentines Day on record.[45] Bridgeport, Connecticut experienced its coldest February temperature, and 2nd coldest all time temperature, at \u22126\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221221\u00a0\u00b0C).[46] Meanwhile, Binghamton hit \u221218\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221228\u00a0\u00b0C). Windchills in Worcester, Massachusetts sunk to \u221244\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221242\u00a0\u00b0C).[47] In spite of \u22121\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) temperatures in New York on February 14, by February 16, the temperature reached 54\u00a0\u00b0F (12\u00a0\u00b0C).[48] Meanwhile, despite Toronto having a windchill on February 14 of \u221234\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0F), the next day it felt like \u22121\u00a0\u00b0C (30\u00a0\u00b0F).[49]",
      "Late February tornado outbreak[edit]": "On February 23, a low-pressure area developed near the east end of Texas and began to track northeastwards into the Mid-Atlantic States in the early hours of February 24. During this period, it also began to interact with some cold air on the back side of it, producing snow and ice in parts of the Ohio Valley, dumping as much as 17.0 inches (43\u00a0cm) of snow.[50] At the same time, ahead of the cold front, severe thunderstorms developed ahead of it, which would eventually lead to the second largest tornado outbreak of the month of February.",
      "March extreme weather events[edit]": "On March 7, an area of low pressure system from the Pineapple Express moved ashore in California as part of the pattern change that allowed the Golden State to receive much-needed rain. Late that evening, it dove into Mexico where it became detached from the main jet stream.[51] It then stalled for a few days and caused some extreme weather events, such as record-breaking heat in the Northeast, with areas achieving their earliest 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C) day on record, which was the result of high pressure off the coast of Florida. It also caused historic floods in the South as well. Areas in Louisiana picked up to over 15 inches (38\u00a0cm) of rain, setting numerous records and triggering multiple flash floods from the extreme rainfall. The highest rainfall report was 23.22 inches (59.0\u00a0cm) near Monroe in Louisiana.[52] The historic events also caused rare snow in Mexico, which rarely receives snow at all.[51]",
      "Late March blizzard[edit]": "On March 21, an area of low pressure moved ashore on the West Coast, with a limited amount of moisture available. Because of this precipitation was originally isolated. As it moved eastward on March 22 it started to intensify and as such snowfall began to become widespread. The storm also began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, achieving a peak of 989 millibars (29.2\u00a0inHg) two times on March 23.[53] Blizzard warnings were issued for areas around Denver due to the strong winds accompanying the system along with snowfall. Parts of Interstate 80 were shut down due to the extreme winter weather conditions.[54] During the storm, Denver International Airport was shut down.[55] Ahead of its cold front, thunderstorms began to fire up, prompting the National Weather Service to issue a tornado watch. A squall line later developed out of this as more storms began to fire up and move eastwards, with the severe weather threat shifting more to the east towards the East Coast.[56] The system also brought ice accumulations from 0.25\u20130.75 inches (6.4\u201319.1\u00a0mm) from the Midwest into New England. It then rapidly weakened and moved offshore late on March 25, dissipating the next day.",
      "Early April clippers and cold wave[edit]": "In the beginning of April, an unusual blast of cold air rushed into the Northeast, bringing temperatures 10\u201330\u00a0\u00b0F (5.6\u201316.7\u00a0\u00b0C) below average for most of the area.[25] Some areas even broke records for lowest April low temperatures. This was paired with a series of Alberta clippers moving through the Great Lakes through the weekend of April 2\u20133.[57] The first clipper brought mainly high winds with it, knocking out power to a few thousand. This clipper then moved off the East Coast the same day and immediately began strengthening, its pressure dropping to 984 millibars (29.1\u00a0inHg) early on April 3, then further deepening to 954 millibars (28.2\u00a0inHg) on April 5. The next clipper system was weaker than the previous one, alias only reaching a peak of 997 millibars (29.4\u00a0inHg) early on April 3, however, gained enough characteristics to become a full-fledged winter storm. Moving fairly quickly, this snowmaker began to drop snow near the Great Lakes at its peak intensity, and as it neared the Northeast, snow began to spread eastward. Early on April 4, light to moderate snow had reached Boston, with locally heavier snowfall rates at times, which made visibility low.[27] By mid-day, rainfall began to fire up along the clipper's cold front, spreading into New York City and New Jersey. This forced the New York Yankees to postpone their home openers against the Houston Astros.[58] It began to accelerate at the same time, moving off the coast late the same day. Total snowfall accumulations from this system ranged from 2\u20136 inches (5.1\u201315.2\u00a0cm), in a swath extending from the Great Lakes into southeastern New England.[27] Providence, Rhode Island set a daily record for snow at 5.9 inches (15\u00a0cm), as well as a daily record for coldest high on the date at 31\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121\u00a0\u00b0C).[59] The 6.4\u00a0in (16\u00a0cm) of snow at Albany, New York resulted in April being the snowiest month of the year.[60] The winter storm led to a crash on Interstate 88.[61] After the storm, Ithaca, New York set a monthly record low of \u22121\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C).[62] Several cities in northern Maine also broke monthly record lows.[63] A third system began plowing into the same areas on April 5\u20136, bringing more snow to the Great Lakes, and also the risk of wildfires in the Southwest.[57] This clipper transitioned into a storm complex early on April 7, and brought heavy rain to parts of the New York metropolitan area. It lingered into early April 8 before finally retreating into Canada. A fourth clipper system reached the Mid-Atlantic states by the weekend of April 9\u201310, and brought both cold temperatures with it, and a swath of accumulating snow of 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2\u00a0cm) from the Ohio Valley into the southern parts of New Jersey.[57] The fourth clipper postponed a Baltimore Orioles game.[64] As it approached the coastline, it began to transition into a small nor'easter. Because of temperatures being at or just above freezing, pockets of wet snow broke out in central New Jersey, with only accumulations on grassy surfaces, but areas further to the south picked up to 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1\u00a0cm),[57] including Atlantic City at 1.8 inches (4.6\u00a0cm).[65] The system moved offshore late by April 9, but brought some more cold temperatures behind it, setting more record lows. Due to the cold brought by the system, wind chills at Nationals Park hovered in the upper 20s and lower 30s. This forced a game between the Miami Marlins and Washington Nationals to postpone.[66] The cold wave finally lifted out of the Northeastern United States by April 12, due to an imminent pattern change that would allow warm air to surge back into the region.[67]",
      "Mid-April storm complex[edit]": "On April 13, an area of disturbed weather associated with the jet stream moved ashore on the West Coast. Moving slowly it dived into the High Plains and Rocky Mountains during the course of the day on April 14. The upper-level low associated began to stall in the area and became cut off from the jet stream, while simultaneously producing a major snowstorm in the Rocky Mountains (with up to as much as 4 feet (48\u00a0in) of snowfall reported) and areas around the Denver metropolitan area and soaked the Central Plains and areas to the south with heavy rain (up to 20 inches (51\u00a0cm) of rainfall was reported early on April 18), flooding, severe thunderstorms, and possibly tornadoes.[68][69][70] Multiple rescue efforts had to be made in southeastern Texas early on April 18, due to the extremely heavy rainfall and flooding.[71][72] The upper low gradually moved out of the region by April 19, alas at a very slow rate.",

      "Hurricane Tico": " Hurricane Tico is one of four major hurricanes to ever strike Mazatlan and one of the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricanes on record. Tico was the twenty-third tropical cyclone, nineteenth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and eighth major hurricane of the 1983 Pacific hurricane season. The origins of Hurricane Tico were a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October\u00a07, 1983. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575\u00a0mi (925\u00a0km) south of Acapulco. On October\u00a012 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October\u00a013. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. Early on October\u00a019, it reached peak winds of 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h). It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500\u00a0UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days. Tico was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the season. Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed. Hurricane Tico was responsible severe flooding and heavy damage due to strong winds. Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000\u00a0acres (77\u00a0km2) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatl\u00e1n. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt. Twenty-five thousand people were homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200\u00a0million (1983\u00a0 USD). Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135\u00a0deaths in Mexico. Although most of its impact occurred in Mexico, Tico's remnants moved into the United States, where they caused heavy rains and flooding. A total of 141\u00a0people were killed and the damage amounted to $284\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD).",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October\u00a07. It tracked westward through an area of progressively warmer water temperatures, and by October\u00a011 the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One, about 575\u00a0mi (930\u00a0km) south of the Mexican port of Acapulco. The depression initially maintained a west-northwest motion, although on October\u00a012 it turned sharply northward, due to the influence of a strong trough moving eastward through Mexico. Gradually organizing, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October\u00a013 by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC).[1] Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify as it progressed toward the southwest Mexican coastline. A Hurricane Hunters flight late on October\u00a013 indicated the beginnings of an eyewall, 14\u00a0miles (22\u00a0km) in diameter, although the eye was open and incomplete. The next day, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status, about 190\u00a0mi (310\u00a0km) off the Guerrero coast. Around that time, a building ridge to the north of Tico turned the hurricane northwestward away from land. The intensity fluctuated by about 20\u00a0mph (35\u00a0km/h) for two days, during which it curved more to the west. By October\u00a016, its strengthening rate quickened, and Tico reached major hurricane status (Category\u00a03 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale).[1] After briefly weakening into a Category\u00a02 hurricane, Hurricane Tico again attained major hurricane strength. Meanwhile, another trough moved eastward across northwestern Mexico; as a result, the hurricane turned northwestward and began accelerating while maintaining a well-defined eye. Early on October\u00a019, it reached peak winds of 135\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), while located about 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500\u00a0UTC that day Tico made landfall very near Mazatl\u00e1n with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h).[1] It rapidly weakened over land and merged with a cold front, although significant moisture from the hurricane persisted into the South Central United States. After dropping heavy rainfall in Oklahoma, the former low associated with Tico continued northeastward to near Lake Michigan. Precipitation spread across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic States as the low turned southeastward, and the remnants of Tico were last observed on October\u00a024 over Ohio.[2]",
      "Preparations, impact, and aftermath[edit]": "",
      "Mexico[edit]": "Although hurricane warnings were issued for portions of the country, many shrimp boat crew members ignored these warnings.[3] As the tropical cyclone passed south of the Baja California Peninsula, it dropped light rainfall of around 1\u00a0inch (25\u00a0mm) in the area. Moderate rainfall was reported around the landfall location, peaking at 8.98\u00a0inches (228\u00a0mm) in Pueblo Nuevo, Durango; lighter precipitation of 1\u20133\u00a0inches (25\u201375\u00a0mm) occurred further inland toward the Mexico/United States border.[2] Two 328\u00a0ft (100\u00a0m) anchored ships were washed aground by strong waves and swells,[4] with a total of seven ships reported missing.[5] Overall, the hurricane sank nine small ships, and nine fishermen were killed.[1] In Mazatl\u00e1n and 22\u00a0other nearby towns, power service was cut off[6] but was restored the next day.[3] The surge and strong winds of Hurricane Tico were responsible for severe flooding and heavy damage. Throughout the state of Sinaloa, the hurricane destroyed nearly 19,000\u00a0acres (77\u00a0km2) of bean and corn, although most of the agricultural damage occurred south of Mazatl\u00e1n.[1] Many roofs of homes received damage. In addition, the hurricane disrupted the flow of drinking water. A total of 13 hotels received extensive damage and 14 people were hurt.[7] Throughout Durango, many bridges collapsed due to flooding.[8] Twenty-five thousand people were homeless and damage throughout the country was estimated at $200\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD).[9] However, the death toll was initially uncertain. Local reports from a few days after the storm indicated 105\u00a0people were missing.[1] According to a report from the United States Agency for International Development indicated that Hurricane Tico caused a total of 135\u00a0deaths in Mexico.[10] Due to destruction from Hurricane Tico, President Miguel De La Madrid declared a state of emergency and also ordered the department of health, defense, and Interior to rush to provide assistance to the devastated state.[7]",
      "United States[edit]": "Flash flood watches and warnings were posted from Texas to Missouri.[11] Rain from Tico continued into the South-Central United States and increased after merging with the cold front. Rainfall totals of 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) extended from the Texas Panhandle through Missouri, and the greatest rainfall maxima was 16.95\u00a0inches (431\u00a0mm) in Chickasha, Oklahoma. Precipitation from Tico continued northeastward and eastward, with rainfall totals of 3\u20137\u00a0inches (75\u2013175\u00a0mm) extending across the Ohio Valley and into the Mid-Atlantic.[2] Flooding was reported in parts of southern Kansas, Texas, and especially Oklahoma,[1] with serious flooding reported along the lower Washita River.[12]\nThe Oklahoma Highway Patrol asked for volunteers with motorboats 16\u00a0ft (4.9\u00a0m) or longer to help rescue 50-100\u00a0trapped people. The patrol also asked the Oklahoma City police to help find victims in the floodwaters, but plans for this were held off late on October 20\u00a0due to poor weather conditions. Across Guthire, 500\u00a0people, or 5% of the town's population, had sought three emergency shelters. According to officials, more evacuations to shelters were anticipated.[3] Authorities planned to evacuate an additional 1,500\u00a0families. Throughout the town, water was 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) deep[13] and was moving at speeds between 20\u00a0mph (32\u00a0km/h) and 30\u00a0mph (48\u00a0km/h). The Cottonwood Creek, also near Guthire, reached flood stage. The nearby Cimarron river was rising 2\u00a0ft (0.61\u00a0m) an hour. In Lexington, Oklahoma guardsmen were called out to help police. Across Lubbock, Texas, sewer pipes were backed up due to 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) inches of rain. Throughout Oklahoma and Texas, 200\u00a0people were homeless and six people were killed and one person was missing. According to Kansas officials, one person was killed in the state. In the aftermath of the storm, residents cleaned up debris on streets.[3][7][13][14] By October\u00a023, people living in Guthire were given permission to return to their homes because floodwaters started to recede.[15] A total of $77\u00a0million in crop damage occurred in Oklahoma. Total damage in the state was estimated at $84\u00a0million (1983\u00a0USD, $182\u00a0million 2009\u00a0USD).[16]",

      "1964 Rameswaram cyclone": "The 1964 Rameswaram cyclone (also known as the Dhanushkodi cyclone) was regarded as one of the most powerful storms to ever strike India on record.[1] The system was first identified as an area of low pressure over the Andaman Sea on December\u00a015. Following interaction with a tropical wave, it began to develop and became a depression by December\u00a018. Increasingly rapid intensification ensued over the following days with the cyclone attaining hurricane-force winds around 5\u00b0N the next day. Early on December\u00a023, the storm struck Ceylon near Trincomalee with winds estimated at 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), ranking it as a modern-day super cyclonic storm. Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu. Rapid weakening followed once the cyclone was onshore and it degenerated into a depression on December\u00a024 as it emerged over the Arabian Sea. The system later dissipated on December\u00a026 over open water.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On December\u00a015, 1964, an area of low pressure was identified over the southern Andaman Sea. Remaining nearly stationary,[2] a tropical wave soon interacted with the low and allowed the system to consolidate into a depression two days later.[3] A large area of showers and thunderstorms covered much of the southern Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. On December\u00a018, a ship with the callsign JMAG reported 45\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph) winds and a barometric pressure of 1005.5 mbar (hPa; 29.69\u00a0inHg). Based on this report, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a deep depression. Over the following days, the system quickly intensified as it began moving slowly westward. By December\u00a019, it became a severe cyclonic storm and soon acquired hurricane-force winds early on December\u00a020 while near 5\u00b0N.[2] The cyclone became one of only a handful of system to attain such an intensity close to the equator.[3] Moving more west-northwesterly, the cyclone continued to deepen as it approached southern India.[2] On December\u00a021, satellite imagery showed clouds from the storm covering an area roughly 965\u00a0km (600\u00a0mi) wide. Several prominent banding features were present, with one such feature, extending over 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) crossing the equator while maintaining a cyclonic arc. Clouds associated with the cyclone extended as far as 485\u00a0km (301\u00a0mi) into the Southern Hemisphere.[3] Several vessels encountered the storm, with one reporting 110\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) winds early on December\u00a022. That day winds along the coast of Ceylon increased; the storm accelerated during this time as well. Early on December\u00a023, the cyclone struck the northern tip of Ceylon and turned back toward the west-northwest. According to an officer on Pamban Island, located between Ceylon and Southern India, the storm's eye was no more than 16\u00a0km (9.9\u00a0mi) wide.[2] Based on satellite imagery, it was estimated that the storm had peak winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), with gusts as high as 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph).[3] This ranked the system as a modern-day super cyclonic storm.[4] Additionally, the IMD estimated its central pressure to have been, at most, 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64\u00a0inHg).[2] The lowest observed pressure was 978\u00a0mbar (978\u00a0hPa; 28.9\u00a0inHg) in Mannar on the west coast of Ceylon.[3] Weakening somewhat, the storm soon struck Tamil Nadu, south of Tondi. Once onshore, the cyclone rapidly weakened, becoming a depression before emerging over the Arabian Sea on December\u00a024. The system degenerated into a remnant low later that day and dissipated over open waters on December\u00a026.[2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "At least 1,800\u00a0people lost their lives as a result of the cyclone.[5][6][7] On December\u00a022, the powerful cyclone struck northern areas of Ceylon and caused catastrophic damage. According to survivors, a storm surge of 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) swept across the area. Initial reports stated that 250\u00a0people lost their lives with thousands missing.[8] About 5000 houses and 700 fishing boats were destroyed in the Jaffna district of Ceylon.[9] The district's paddy crop was also destroyed.[9] Other badly hit areas include Mannar and Trincomallee.[9] The Trincomallee port suffered severe damage rendering it inoperable.[9] The economic damage caused in Ceylon was estimated at Rs. 200 million. About 350 Ceylonese fishermen were missing at sea.[9] At least 1,000\u00a0people were killed on the island and many more were left unaccounted for.[10] An unofficial estimate stated that the death toll would likely exceed 2,000.[8] The government regarded it as, \"the greatest tragedy to ever hit Ceylon.\"[10] The effects of the cyclone were felt mostly in Pamban Island, which lies between the Indian mainland and Ceylon.[9] More than 3000 people, many of them tourists and pilgrims, were stranded on the island. The total damage to property was estimated at $150 million.[9] On December\u00a023, an estimated 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) storm surge struck the town of Dhanuskodi on the south-eastern edge of the island,[11] submerging the town and overturning the Pamban-Dhanuskodi passenger train killing all 200 passengers on board.[12] The town, an important transit point between India and Ceylon, was completely destroyed and has not been rebuilt since.[13] Prior to the cyclone, the town had been an important commercial centre with a railway station, a customs office, post and telegraphs office, two medical institutions, one railway hospital, a panchayat union dispensary, a higher elementary school and port offices.[14] A port had been functioning since 1 March 1914.[14] At least 800\u00a0people were killed in Dhanushkodi alone.[10] Four radio operators remained in Dhanuskodi and risked their lives to continue broadcasting during the storm. Two railway employees patrolling the Pamban Bridge survived by clinging to the bridge frame for 12\u00a0hours. The Indian Government later honored and rewarded them for their dedication.[15]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "The scale of the disaster left villages isolated for at least three days and without food or clean water. Communication lines were severely damaged and hampered relief efforts. By December\u00a026, relief supplies were delivered to 14\u00a0villages by the Ceylonese Air Force. Britain, Cuba, West Germany, and the United States offered aid to Ceylon.[8] Reconstruction of the Pamban Bridge was deemed a priority and initially expected to take six\u00a0months to complete. However, E. Sreedharan, an engineer tasked on the project, managed to have the railway bridge finished in 45\u00a0days. A stable road connection was built in the following years.[15] In Mandapam, the cyclone's surge created five tidal pools over a 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) stretch of coastline. Three of the pools had higher than normal salinity coupled with below-average silicate content and were colonized by Peridinium. The other two featured opposite levels of salinity and silicate and were inhabited by Pyrocystis fusiformis. All five featured bioluminescence as a result. A study of these pools in 1965 showed a, \"clear succession of organisms\", with species of Penaeidae (Prawn), one species of amphipoda, one species of crab, and Acetes inhabiting the pools. Researchers also found a few Sepioteuthis and tintinnid. Lastly, 46\u00a0species of coastal fish were documented.[11] Offshore, catastrophic damage occurred to coral reefs, with Echinopora lamellosa, Montipora foliosa, and alcyonarians being killed in large numbers. At Manacadu Point, near Mandapam, an elevated coral colony of Faviids and Porites was completely wiped out. In the eight years following the storm, colonies showed substantial growth across the Palk Strait, with Acropora corymbosa covering 25\u201330% of the reefs. Colonies of alcyonarians showed little sign of rejuvenation, however. Along the immediate coastline, the large-scale stirring of sand made areas unsuitable for coral and were not expected to ever regrow.[16]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Hurricane Charley (1986)": "Hurricane Charley was the second hurricane to threaten the East Coast of the United States within a year's timeframe, after Hurricane Gloria of 1985.[1] The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Charley formed as a subtropical low on August\u00a013 along the Florida panhandle. After moving off the coast of South Carolina, the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone and intensified into a tropical storm on August\u00a015. Charley later attained hurricane status before moving across eastern North Carolina. It gradually weakened over the north Atlantic Ocean before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August\u00a020. Charley's remnants remained identifiable for over a week, until after crossing Ireland and Great Britain they dissipated on August\u00a030. The storm brought light to moderate precipitation to much of the southeastern United States. In Georgia and South Carolina, the rainfall alleviated drought conditions. In North Carolina, where the hurricane made landfall, tidal flooding and downed trees were the primary impacts. The storm brought high winds to southeastern Virginia, where 110,000\u00a0people were left without power. Minor damage extended along the Atlantic coastline northward through Massachusetts. One traffic fatality was reported each in North Carolina and Virginia. Three people in Maryland died due to a plane crash related to the storm. Throughout the United States, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated US$15\u00a0million in damage (equivalent to US$41,700,000 in 2023). One person drowned in Newfoundland. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11\u00a0deaths. In Ireland, the rainfall set records for 24-hour totals, including an accumulation of more than 7.8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country. In the country, the rainfall caused widespread flooding, causing two rivers to exceed their banks. In the Dublin area, 451\u00a0buildings were flooded, some up to a depth of 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m). In the United Kingdom, the storm flooded rivers and brought down trees and power lines.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Hurricane Charley originated in an area of convection associated with a trough of low pressure first observed on August\u00a011 across southern Florida and the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The area of disturbed weather spread northward, spawning a broad low-pressure area on August\u00a012. Moving northward over the Florida panhandle, the low became slightly better organized as it merged with a weakening weather front.[2] On August\u00a013, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) identified the system as a developing subtropical low near Apalachee Bay along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.[3] The agency defines a subtropical cyclone as \"a non-frontal low pressure system that has characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones.\"[4] After becoming a subtropical low, the cyclone tracked northeastward through Georgia, before turning eastward and exiting South Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean. Its track was influenced by the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, which is a large belt of high pressure.[1] While moving over land, the cyclone had become better organized,[2] and on August\u00a015 it transitioned into a tropical depression about 70 miles (110 kilometres) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.[3] The depression strengthened further, and based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, it intensified into Tropical Storm Charley late on August\u00a015. With a weak ridge to its north, the storm initially tracked slowly eastward just off the coast of North Carolina, before turning to the north-northeast as a trough approached from the west.[2] A broad cyclone, Charley gradually intensified, and a single ring of convection around the center developed into an eyewall.[5] At 1200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, it attained hurricane status about 13\u00a0mi (21\u00a0km) off the North Carolina coastline. About two hours later, Hurricane Charley made landfall near Cape Lookout, and it subsequently moved across the eastern portion of the state.[3] Hurricane Charley did not weaken while moving over land; instead, it intensified, attaining peak winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina\u2013Virginia border.[6] Within 12\u00a0hours of reaching peak intensity, however, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status.[1] The approaching trough, which had previously caused Charley to turn northward, forced the hurricane to accelerate northeastward and later eastward, bringing the storm about 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts on August\u00a019.[2] As the trough was not very strong, Charley slowly underwent the process of extratropical transition, unlike other tropical cyclones that complete the transition much quicker with a stronger trough. As a result, the storm maintained hybrid, or subtropical characteristics for several days.[7] By August\u00a021, Charley completed the transition south of Atlantic Canada.[8] After becoming extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting storm was a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean.[8] As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980\u00a0mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone.[6] On August\u00a024, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain.[9] The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British & Irish Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August\u00a027.[6] While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August\u00a030 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.[8]",
      "North American impact[edit]": "",
      "Southeastern United States[edit]": "As the hurricane paralleled the east coast of the United States and its exact track and strength were uncertain, there were several tropical cyclone warnings and watches issued in association with Charley; in a post-storm analysis, the NHC described \"the complication of the warning process for this type of situation.\"[10] Initially, the storm was not expected to affect land. In its first advisory on Charley, the NHC issued a 22% probability of Charley passing within 65\u00a0mi (105\u00a0km) of land; specifically, it was predicted to be closest to the South Carolina coastline.[11] About 16\u00a0hours prior to the hurricane's landfall, the NHC issued a gale warning between Bogue Inlet and Oregon Inlet along the North Carolina coastline, including the Pamlico Sound. When the storm's intensification and track close to land became apparent, the gale warning was replaced by a hurricane warning, and additional gale warnings were issued westward to Topsail Beach and northward to Virginia Beach, Virginia.[12] Up to 10,000\u00a0people evacuated the Outer Banks, which resulted in traffic jams on roadways heading out of the area. Ocracoke island was partially evacuated by six ferries, although many people were unable to leave and instead rode out the storm on the island.[13] Hurricane Charley affected at least ten U.S. states,[8][10][14] resulting in five total deaths and $15\u00a0million in damage (1986\u00a0USD).[1] The precursor disturbance to Charley brought rainfall to much of Florida, including a total of 8.61 inches (219 millimetres) in Steinhatchee; that rainfall maxima was the greatest total associated with Charley within the United States.[14] The system also produced light to moderate rainfall across Georgia and South Carolina,[14] which proved beneficial as the region was in a major drought. However, its heaviest rainfall remained over open waters.[8] Moving across eastern North Carolina as a minimal hurricane, Charley produced locally strong wind gusts, peaking at 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) in Frisco. However, no stations recorded sustained winds of hurricane force.[15] The cyclone dropped rainfall along the coastline, amounting to over 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) near Manteo.[14] As it moved ashore, the storm generated high tides reaching 5.78\u00a0feet (1.76\u00a0metres) at the Duck Coe fishing pier.[16] Near Cape Hatteras, a woman drowned while attempting to drive through a flooded roadway.[8] The hurricane's passage left roads and bridges flooded with up to 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) of water, including a portion of North Carolina Highway 12 on Hatteras Island. Across the Outer Banks, the storm left about 8,000\u00a0people without power, but damage was minimal and limited to shingles and roofs.[17] Impact in the state was primarily caused by tidal flooding and downed trees, and a preliminary damage estimate placed total monetary losses at $400,000 (1986\u00a0USD).[8]",
      "Northeastern United States and Canada[edit]": "As Charley moved across eastern North Carolina, hurricane warnings were extended northward, first to Virginia Beach; they were later extended to Cape Charles, then to the Maryland/Delaware border, and ultimately as far north as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.[12] Prior to its arrival, the storm resulted in the closure of Norfolk International Airport, and more than 9,000\u00a0people evacuated the coastline for emergency shelters.[13] Tropical storm force winds spread across southeastern Virginia, with wind gusts reaching 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h) on Cape Charles.[1] Offshore, a station on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel recorded sustained winds of 97\u00a0mph (156\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 104\u00a0mph (167\u00a0km/h).[10] After the gust, the bridge-tunnel was closed overnight.[13] The winds downed many trees,[10] and in Norfolk, a motorist died after crashing into a downed tree.[8] In Virginia Beach, the winds blew off the roof of a hotel and destroyed two homes under construction.[10] Across the area, the storm left about 110,000\u00a0customers without power.[13] Rainfall in Virginia was fairly light, including a 24-hour total of just over 1\u00a0in (25\u00a0mm) in Norfolk.[15] Strong waves destroyed 250\u00a0ft (76\u00a0m) of Harrison's Pier in Norfolk.[13] A preliminary damage estimate for the area was $1\u00a0million (1986\u00a0USD).[10] Thunderstorms to the north of the circulation brought moderate rainfall to Maryland; the same thunderstorms caused a light aircraft to crash near Baltimore, resulting in the death of its three occupants.[8] Rainfall spread across much of Maryland,[14] peaking at 4.24\u00a0in (108\u00a0mm) in Hollywood.[16] Tropical storm force winds extended into Delaware, and a peak wind gust of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) was reported in Rehoboth Beach.[16] Only isolated and minor damage occurred in Maryland and Delaware.[8] In New Jersey, a hurricane\u00a0force wind gust was reported on Long Beach Island, and 1.3\u00a0in (33\u00a0mm) of rainfall was reported in Atlantic City.[1] In the southernmost counties in the state, the winds left about 15,000\u00a0electrical customers without power.[13] In New York, after Hurricane Gloria in the previous season left thousands of customers without power, the Long Island Lighting Co. arranged for additional workers for potential power restoration.[13] Light rainfall and gusty winds extended into the New York metropolitan area.[1] Officials issued gale warnings through Chatham, Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.[12][18] As Charley passed south of Massachusetts, it produced precipitation in the southeastern portion of the state. Nantucket reported 3.20\u00a0in (81\u00a0mm) of rainfall, and Chatham recorded 2.68\u00a0in (68\u00a0mm) in a 24-hour period. Nantucket also reported sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), and as the storm passed the island it produced a storm tide of 3.5\u20134\u00a0ft (1.1\u20131.2\u00a0m).[15] High tides and heavy rain caused significant street flooding on Nantucket. Several boats were damaged, others were beached, and one large boat sunk in Nantucket Harbor. Damage on the island $75,000 (1986\u00a0USD).[10] Before becoming extratropical, the storm brushed the coast of Nova Scotia with wind gusts of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and moderate precipitation totaling 4.57\u00a0in (116\u00a0mm).[9] Strong waves damaged several boats along the coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, killing one person in St. John's, Newfoundland.[19]",
      "European impact[edit]": "After Charley became extratropical, the United Kingdom Met Office issued weather alerts prior to the arrival of the storm, noting the potential for \"extremely heavy rainfall [which would] cause local flooding.\"[9] In the United Kingdom, the threat of the storm resulted in the cancellation of ferry service between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as well between Great Britain and France.[30] The extratropical remnants of Hurricane Charley moved across Ireland and United Kingdom with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[6] The storm's rainfall significantly affected most of both countries, with the exception of Scotland in the United Kingdom.[30][31] In the English Channel, waves up to 26\u00a0ft (7.9\u00a0m) in height breached and flooded a ship; the 31\u00a0passengers on board were rescued by helicopters and other ships.[31] Throughout the region, the storm resulted in at least 11\u00a0deaths.[30]",
      "Ireland[edit]": "First passing just south of Ireland on August\u00a025, the storm dropped heavy rainfall and brought strong winds, significantly affecting the coastline where winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) were reported. Rainfall spread across the entire country, peaking at 11.0\u00a0in (280\u00a0mm) in Kippure mountain. There, a station reported more than 7.8\u00a0in (200\u00a0mm) in 24\u00a0hours, which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country. Several 24-hour rainfall records were set during the storm, and new six-hour and twelve-hour record totals at Casement Aerodrome were set with 1.63 and 2.61\u00a0in (41 and 66\u00a0mm), respectively.[9] The rainfall left some areas flooded,[30] particularly in the Dublin area where 451\u00a0buildings were inundated, some up to a depth of 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m). Preliminarily, it was described as the worst flooding in the history of Dublin.[9] Two small rivers, the Dodder and the Dargle, overflowed their banks due to the rainfall.[9] The River Dargle overflowed in Bray, flooding some areas up to a depth of 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) and forcing about 1,000\u00a0people to evacuate;[31] several special-needs people were evacuated by boat. The flood, which originated about one mile north of the town, damaged over 500\u00a0houses and brought down several trees. Despite local politicians promising for flood protection after the flood, the town remained vulnerable to such flooding at least 20\u00a0years after the storm.[32] The River Dodder, which also overflowed, nearly exceeded the reservoir dam in Bohernabreena in South Dublin (flooding on the Dodder has been a periodic problem for centuries). Additional spillways were later added in the event of another similar flood.[33] In the Wicklow Mountains, the rainfall resulted in significant runoff, which caused erosion along the Cloghoge River.[34] The passage of the storm left heavy crop damage, part of a larger period of poor agriculture in the country.[31] Throughout the country, the storm caused at least thirteen deaths, four of which were drownings in flooded rivers; one death was caused by a heart attack while being evacuated from flooding.[30] Two months after the storm struck, the government of Ireland allocated IR\u00a36,449,000 (1986\u00a0IEP, $8,650,000 1986\u00a0USD) to repair roads and bridges damaged by the weather system.[35]",
      "United Kingdom[edit]": "The storm also affected the United Kingdom as it moved across the southern portion of the country.[6] In Wales, Charley produced record-breaking daily rainfall, which surpassed 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) in Dyfed. Some locations received hundred-year rainfall.[36] The storm struck the area during the Late Summer Bank Holiday, creating unfavorable conditions for driving and resulting in several accidents.[31] Heavy rainfall flooded rivers, which swept away several people. This prompted officials to deploy boats and helicopters to assist in rescues, although at least three deaths were reported due to drowning in the rivers. Severe flooding was reported in Cumbria and Gloucestershire. The storm also left roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. At the start of the storm, the inaugural Birmingham Super Prix motorsport race was just getting underway but poor visibility from precipitation contributed to an accident which temporarily called halt to proceedings. In Whitland, Wales, local soldiers assisted rescuing people, and later contributed to the cleanup of the town. Throughout the country, five people were missing after the storm, all of whom are presumed to have drowned; an additional death was confirmed in Newry, Northern Ireland.[30]",

      "2017 California floods": " ($1,926,663,046 today[4]) Flooding in 2017 affected parts of California in the first half of the year. Northern California saw its wettest winter in almost a century, breaking the record set in 1982\u201383.[6] The same storm systems also flooded parts of western Nevada and southern Oregon. The damage was estimated at $1.55 billion\n($1,926,663,046 today[4]),[3] including damage to California roads and highways estimated at more than $1.05 billion.[7][5] The flooding occurred at the end of one of California's worst droughts on record, and much of the state was unprepared to handle the huge volume of rain and snow. The precipitation helped to refill surface water supplies, including many major lakes and reservoirs, but had limited impact on groundwater reserves.[8] Governor Jerry Brown declared the drought officially over on April\u00a04, 2017.[9]",
      "Background[edit]": "The high-amplitude ridge off the West Coast that characterized the 2011\u201317 California drought, dubbed the \"Ridiculously Resilient Ridge\", was replaced by a persistent presence of anomalous troughs affected California. Another feature in the 2013\u20132015 winters was the extreme temperature contrast between a warm western U.S. and a cold eastern continent. These anomalous temperature and circulation patterns were referred to as the North American winter \u201cdipole\u201d.[10][11][12] The dipole basically describes the wintertime stationary waves over North America, which contribute to the mean temperature difference between the climatologically warmer western U.S. and colder eastern half. Therefore, an amplification of the stationary wave would enhance such a temperature difference, like in the 2013-2015 winters, while a weakening of the stationary wave would reverse the situation, like in the 2016\u20132017 winter.[13] Indeed, in winter 2016\u20132017 this dipole was apparently reversed.[14][15]",
      "Effects[edit]": "",
      "Northern California[edit]": "In early January 2017, the Russian River in Sonoma and Mendocino Counties rose 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) above flood stage, inundating about 500 houses.[16] More than 570,000 customers of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company lost power in Northern and Central California during the event. More than 3,000 people in the Guerneville area were evacuated.[17] The community of Forestville and the nearby Laguna de Santa Rosa flooded, blocking roads and agricultural lands. Flooding in the Russian River valley inundated vineyards, causing millions of dollars in crop damage.[18] The American River east of Sacramento reached record flows, although property damage was limited by the protection provided by Folsom Dam. The maximum flood release of 70,000 cubic feet per second (2,000\u00a0m3/s) was the highest since 1997.[19][20] The popular recreation areas at the American River Parkway and Discovery Park were flooded for four months.[21][22] On the early morning of February 18, flash flooding on Stone Corral Creek flooded the town of Maxwell in Colusa County.[23] More than 100 residents had to be evacuated by boat after water filled the streets.[24] Floods and mudslides closed roads in numerous areas in Northern California. Both directions of U.S. Route 395 was temporarily closed in Mono County.[25]",
      "San Francisco Bay Area[edit]": "Anderson Dam in Morgan Hill overflowed in February for the first time in 11 years. The resulting flooding along Coyote Creek forced the evacuation of 14,000 people in San Jose[26][27][28] and caused $73 million in damage.[29] City workers reportedly tried to warn authorities of the flooding risk as much as a day before the river burst its banks, but it remains unclear why evacuations were not ordered until the flooding actually began.[30] The Puerto Suello Hill Tunnel along the Sonoma\u2013Marin Area Rail Transit line was partially damaged by mudslides; this delayed pre-revenue testing of the system for three weeks.[31]",
      "Oroville Dam spillway failures[edit]": "On February 7, heavy flows damaged the spillway of Oroville Dam in Butte County. However, due to heavy storm runoff into Lake Oroville, dam operators were forced to continue using the concrete spillway, eventually destroying the lower half of the chute. The reservoir rose so quickly that it overtopped the emergency spillway, which had never been tested for safety, and threatened to undermine it. More than 188,000 people in the Feather River valley were evacuated as officials feared the collapse of the emergency spillway, which could have sent a 30-foot (9\u00a0m) wall of water into the Feather River below and flooded communities downstream. High water flows in the Feather River caused considerable damage, collapsing the river banks and destroying large areas of farmland. The Feather River Fish Hatchery was flooded with turbid water, and several million juvenile salmon had to be evacuated from the facility. The estimated cost to repair Oroville Dam is $400 million.[32]\nAs of September 2018, the actual cost of repairs had risen to $1.1 billion.[33]",
      "Central California[edit]": "The San Joaquin River reached its highest levels since 1997, due to the opening of upstream dams to manage flooding, and flood stage was exceeded along portions of the river.[34] On February 20, a levee breached near Manteca, and 500 people were evacuated, though the damage was quickly repaired.[35] Increased flow to the Fresno River, which is normally dry, and the San Joaquin River delayed construction on parts of California High-Speed Rail's Fresno River Viaduct and San Joaquin River Viaduct.[36] Multiple landslides and bridge collapses in the Big Sur area closed a long stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway, isolating coastal communities. The road is expected to reopen north of Big Sur by September, but a massive landslide about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) south of Big Sur may take over a year to clear.[37] The Pioneer Cabin Tree, a giant sequoia in Calaveras Big Trees State Park, known since 1880 for its human-made \"tunnel\" that hikers could pass through, was toppled by one of the storms on January 9.[38]",
      "Southern California[edit]": "Southern California was not as heavily hit as the north; however, storms during February 16\u201319 were the strongest in seven years. Five people drowned in the Greater Los Angeles urban area as heavy rainfall flooded highways, created sinkholes and cut power to 110,000 households.[39] In Sun Valley water across Interstate 5 was more than 2+1\u20442 feet deep, trapping motorists in their cars. In Orange County, three people were safely rescued from the Santa Ana River, while in Thousand Oaks one man drowned and three others were injured in a flash flood in Arroyo Conejo Creek.[40] In the Santa Barbara area, flooding closed major roads including Highway 101 and led to debris flows in recently burned areas. Rural mountain communities near Goleta and Solvang were evacuated. The flooding also partially refilled Lake Cachuma, an important local water source which had essentially dried up in the preceding drought.[41]",
      "Other effects[edit]": "",
      "Dams, reservoirs, and lakes[edit]": "Dams were opened to relieve pressure from built-up floodwaters, with the Sacramento Weir on the Sacramento River being opened for the first time in eleven years.[16] The spillways at Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River and New Don Pedro Dam on the Tuolumne River were also opened for the first time since 1997.[42][43] Overflow from the Sacramento River inundated the huge floodplain of the Yolo Bypass;[44] peak flow through the bypass reached more than 200,000 cubic feet per second (5,700\u00a0m3/s).[45] The flooding filled multiple major reservoirs to capacity which had been previously at low levels from the drought. New Melones Lake, only about a quarter full in late 2016, reached almost 90\u00a0percent by early June 2017.[46] Lake Berryessa also filled for the first time since 2006, causing water to overflow into the \"Glory Hole\" spillway at Monticello Dam.[47] In Kern County, Lake Isabella hit its maximum allowed capacity for the first time in six years and putting stress on the structurally inadequate Isabella Dam.[48] On the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, Lake Tahoe received the most precipitation in 117 years of record-keeping, contributing to the fastest water level rise in the lake's history.[49] Increased outflow from Lake Tahoe contributed to flooding along the Truckee River through Truckee and Reno, Nevada. Lake Tahoe and most of the Truckee reservoirs were filled by mid-July, a level not seen since 1997.[50][51]",
      "Summer flooding[edit]": "Heavy winter storms resulted in the largest Sierra Nevada snowpack since 2011 and the seventh largest since 1950, reaching 164\u00a0percent of the normal seasonal peak.[52] The extremely high snowpack continued to create hazardous conditions into summer as it melted. At least 14 people drowned in California rivers in May and June 2017.[53] In Bakersfield, the Kern River reached its highest summer levels since 1983.[54] Over Memorial Day weekend three people drowned in the swift waters and 24 were rescued.[55] In Yosemite National Park, the Merced River also hit dangerously high levels. On June 5, a man was swept away in the river; rangers were unable to recover his body.[56]",
      "Long-term effects[edit]": "At the beginning of the next winter season, many reservoirs still remained at above-average levels, due to the storm rain and prolonged snowmelt from 2017. Some of the water had been used to replenish strained groundwater levels.[57][58][59]",

      "Cyclone Monty": "Severe Tropical Cyclone Monty was a powerful category 4 tropical cyclone that formed during late February 2004. Monty was the 6th tropical cyclone and the 3rd Severe tropical cyclone of the 2003-04 Australian region cyclone season. Monty made landfall in a large, sparsely populated region of the Pilbara, Western Australia. Due to the low population, damages inland were not high, although there was major flooding and many roads were impassable because they were flooded or washed away by water. Monty set record high amounts of flooding in some parts of Western Australia.[1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A low pressure area tracked westwards over Pilbara. The low moved off of the Kimberley Coast on February 26. Over the warm ocean waters, the low rapidly developed within 24 hours to a tropical cyclone. Monty paralleled the Pilbara coast and intensified to Category 4. On the 28th, a ragged eye became evident on a visible satellite image. On February 29, a buoy 10 nautical miles away from the center of Monty reported mean winds of 92\u00a0mph (80 knots, 148 kmh). That day, a well developed eye became visible on IR satellite imagery. Monty's peak intensity was estimated to be around 0900 UTC, as a category 4 storm, on February 29. Low wind shear of less than 10 knots allowed for development until Monty made landfall as a category 3 storm. Monty began to slowly weaken as it approached the coast of Pilbara. As Monty moved forwards inland, it began to rapidly weaken and speed up but still caused major flooding in Pilbara. As Monty continued inland, it weakened to a category 2 storm on March 2. On March 3, 2004, Monty had degenerated into a remnant low over central Western Australia.[2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "While over the water, Monty caused significant disruption to oil and gas facilities off the Pilbara coast. Minor property damage occurred over land, although two vessels broke their mornings, ran aground and caused considerable damage. Monty caused major flooding and washed away a few roads in Pilbara. Due to the flooding, 2 people had to be rescued off of the roof of a home in Yarraloola on the Robe River. The town of Pannawonica was cut off by flood waters, Maitland's bridge was washed away at the North West Coastal Highway. The flooding on the Maitland, Robe and Fortescue Rivers was said to be the highest on record.",
      "Rain Observations[edit]": "",
      "Wind Gust Observations[edit]": "",
      "Retirement[edit]": "As a result of its damage, the name Monty was retired and will not be used for another tropical cyclone in the region. Its name was replaced with Mitchell, which was first used in 2012.",

      "January 2016 United States blizzard": "The January 2016 United States blizzard produced up to 3\u00a0ft (91\u00a0cm) of snow in parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States during January 22\u201324, 2016. A weather system, evolving from a shortwave trough that formed in the Pacific Northwest on January 19, consolidated into a defined low-pressure area on January\u00a021 over Texas. Meteorologists indicated that a resultant storm could produce more than 2\u00a0ft (61\u00a0cm) of snow across a wide swath of the Mid-Atlantic region and could \"paralyze the eastern third of the nation\", and regarded it as a \"potentially historic blizzard\".[1][2] Winter weather expert Paul Kocin described the blizzard as \"kind of a top-10 snowstorm\".[3] On January\u00a020\u201322, the governors of eleven states and the mayor of Washington, D.C., declared a state of emergency in anticipation of significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Approximately 103\u00a0million people were affected by the storm, with 33\u00a0million people placed under blizzard warnings. More than 13,000\u00a0flights were cancelled in relation to the storm, with effects rippling internationally. Thousands of National Guardsmen were placed on standby, and states deployed millions of gallons of brine and thousands of tons of road salt to lessen the storm's effect on roadways. A travel ban was instituted for New York City and Newark, New Jersey, for January\u00a023\u201324. The storm was given various unofficial names, including Winter Storm Jonas, Blizzard of 2016, and Snowzilla. Seven states observed snowfall in excess of 30\u00a0in (76\u00a0cm), with accumulations peaking at 42\u00a0in (110\u00a0cm) in Glengary, West Virginia. Ice- and snow-covered roads led to hundreds of incidents across the affected region, several of which resulted in deaths and injuries. At least 55\u00a0people were killed in storm-related incidents: Twelve in Virginia; nine in Pennsylvania; six each in New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina; four in South Carolina; three each in Maryland and Washington, D.C.; and one each in Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Ohio. Total economic losses are estimated between $500\u00a0million and $3\u00a0billion. The storm ranked as a Category\u00a05 \"extreme\" event for the Northeast on the Regional Snowfall Index, and a Category\u00a04 event for the Southeast.[4][5] It is the most recent winter storm to rank as a Category 5 winter storm, and the first to do so since the 2011 Groundhog Day blizzard.",
      "Preceding storm[edit]": "A relatively minor storm ahead of the blizzard, similar to an Alberta clipper,[6] caught numerous drivers off-guard, producing a brief period of heavy snow during rush hour in the Mid-Atlantic region on January\u00a020.[7] Although only 1\u00a0in (2.5\u00a0cm) of snow fell in Washington, D.C., roadways were not treated; any snow that melted on roads quickly froze into black ice, rendering them impassable. Some referred to the event as \"Carmageddon 2.0\".[6] Portions of Interstate 95 and Interstate 495 in Virginia and Maryland (especially on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge), as well as Interstate 270, were brought to a standstill through the early hours of January\u00a021.[6] Virginia State Police responded to 767\u00a0accidents and 392\u00a0reports of disabled vehicles.[8] The Virginia Department of Transportation mobilized 115\u00a0salt trucks to clear roads.[6] A man was killed after being struck by a snow plow in Beltsville, Maryland.[8] Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued an apology for inadequate preparations in the wake of the storm on January\u00a022.[9] Vehicles in Maryland became stranded, with some residents abandoning their cars altogether.[10] Georgia Governor Nathan Deal issued a state of emergency for northern counties on January\u00a019, ensuring areas were better prepared than during a similar storm in 2014.[11] Icy conditions prompted road closures in northern Georgia, including portions of Interstate 75; several crashes resulted from the dangerous conditions.[12] Similar conditions affected Tennessee and Kentucky; schools closed on account of dangerous roads.[13] One person died and another was injured in an accident in Knox County after speeding on slippery roads.[8][14] Two deaths resulted from snow-related car accidents in North Carolina.[7] Another person died, and two others were injured, when a car collided with a salt truck in Whitley County, Kentucky.[15]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The development of the winter storm was anticipated by forecasters for at least a week.[16] It originated in a shortwave trough\u2014a weather disturbance in the upper atmosphere\u2014that came ashore at the Pacific Northwest on January 19.[17] The trough strengthened as it moved southeastward through the Great Plains,[18] and on January 21 it spawned a weak low-pressure area over central Texas.[19] The incipient storm system began to intensify as it tracked eastward through the Gulf Coast states, triggering a line of strong to severe thunderstorms and multiple tornado warnings.[20] During the mid-afternoon hours of January\u00a022, a new low-pressure area began to develop over the coast of the Carolinas, as the former storm tracked into central Georgia. Owing to uncertainty in short-range guidance but a high confidence of a sharp northern edge of precipitation, many forecasts were predicting 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) of snow or less until just hours before snowfall began, from Allentown, Pennsylvania, toward New York City and the southern coast of New England. As the storm moved further north and rapidly strengthened, it became apparent that snowfall would be much higher farther north, and forecasters quickly began upgrading their totals.[21] Early on January 24, as the storm was leaving New England, the system began to become elongated, as a secondary low developed to the southwest of the storm's central low.[22] On January 25, the blizzard left the East Coast of the United States; on the same day, the system was named Karin by the University of Berlin.[23] Accompanied by a strong jet stream in the Atlantic, the remnants of the storm crossed the British Isles on January 26. The wind and rain associated with the low was forecast to have the potential to cause disruption in the United Kingdom,[24] and indeed there were areas that saw severe weather.[25] During the next few days, the system accelerated towards the northeast. On January 29, the storm system was absorbed by Windstorm Leone, over Finland.[26]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Multiple offices of the National Weather Service issued various watches and warnings across the storm's projected path. Blizzard warnings covered coastal Connecticut; most of Delaware; most of Maryland; Massachusetts, particularly Martha's Vineyard; most of New Jersey; New York, including New York City; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island, especially Block Island; Virginia; and Washington, D.C.[27] Winter storm warnings were issued from Arkansas to Massachusetts, including parts of Connecticut, northern Georgia, extreme southern Illinois, extreme southern Indiana, the entirety of Kentucky, extreme northeastern Louisiana, southeastern Massachusetts, northeastern Mississippi, extreme southeastern Missouri, extreme southern New York, most of North Carolina, southern Ohio, southern Rhode Island, northern South Carolina, most of Tennessee, most of Virginia, and all of West Virginia.[28][29] Freezing rain advisories covered parts of North and South Carolina.[30] Further winter weather advisories covered additional portions of the country, including eastern Kansas, southeastern Missouri, and northern Alabama.[31] Offshore, storm warnings covered areas from Georgia to Maine.[32][33] On January\u00a021\u201322, the governors of Delaware,[34] Georgia,[35] Kentucky,[36] Maryland,[37] New York,[38] New Jersey,[39] North Carolina,[40] Virginia,[37] Pennsylvania,[41] Tennessee,[42] West Virginia,[43] and the mayor of Washington, D.C., declared a state of emergency in anticipation of significant snowfall and blizzard conditions.[37] Airlines cancelled more than 1,000\u00a0flights, with hundreds more preemptively grounded, by the afternoon of January\u00a021 for January\u00a022\u201324. Ripple effect cancellations spread across the entire East Coast.[44] By the afternoon of January\u00a023, more than 10,100\u00a0flights were cancelled across the country,[45] affecting well over 100,000\u00a0travelers.[46] Nearly 2,000 more flights were delayed.[47] Most airports in the Mid-Atlantic region suspended service altogether, with Baltimore\u2013Washington International, Philadelphia International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National, and Washington Dulles International closed through the evening of January\u00a024.[45][48] Flights to and from LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy International, and Newark Liberty International were largely cancelled as well.[45] American Airlines suspended all flights departing from Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, causing a ripple of flights being cancelled throughout the country. Effects rippled internationally, with more than 100 flights in Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom cancelled.[45][49][50] Altogether, 13,046\u00a0flights were cancelled between January\u00a022 and 26.[51] Amtrak suspended service for many lines, including the Crescent service from New York City to New Orleans; the Cardinal to Chicago; and the Silver Meteor to Miami.[52] Multiple sporting events, including those held by the Atlantic Coast Conference, National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League, were postponed by the storm, while the National Football League's Arizona Cardinals vs. Carolina Panthers NFC Championship went on as planned for January 24 in Charlotte.[53][54]",
      "Mid-Atlantic[edit]": "A snow emergency was declared for Washington, D.C., meaning that residents would not be allowed to park on snow emergency routes after 9:30\u00a0p.m. local time on January\u00a022.[37] Mayor Bowser urged people to remain home during the storm, \"[u]nless you absolutely have to be out tomorrow afternoon [January\u00a022], residents should get home as soon as possible\".[9] Across Maryland, 2,700\u00a0pieces of snow equipment were mobilized and crews planned to distribute 365,000\u00a0tons of road salt. In Virginia, 500\u00a0vehicles were deployed to treat roads and 500\u00a0members of the Virginia National Guard were placed on standby.[37] Schools across the D.C. area were scheduled to end classes early on January\u00a022, before the storm's arrival.[55] Stores across Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., reported a substantial uptick in sales, with groceries, heaters, shovels, and similar items sold out in numerous locations.[8] West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin mobilized the state's National Guard on January\u00a021.[56] The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) announced on January 21 that it would shut down its entire mass transit system over the weekend of January 22 and 23, including the Washington Metro and Metrobus, making it the longest such shutdown in the agency's history.[57][58] On January\u00a025, the WMATA operated limited Metro bus service, as well as rail service only on the underground portions of the Red, Green, and Orange Lines; however, fares were not charged.[59] In Richmond, Virginia, all flights out of Richmond International Airport on January 23 were cancelled,[60] and the Greater Richmond Transit Company (GTRC) bus system took the rare step of suspending all routes on January 24.[61] The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation had 2,200\u00a0vehicles and more than 733,000\u00a0tons of road salt on standby for use. Trucks deployed brine across major roads in and around Philadelphia, though residents were advised to avoid travel unless necessary.[62] A travel ban was declared for Lancaster, Lebanon, Newberry Township, and York on January\u00a023.[63][64] SEPTA issued a near complete shutdown of its services, shutting down all bus services and closing all rail except for the Broad Street Line and Market\u2013Frankford Line subways.[65] New York City mayor Bill de Blasio declared a hazardous travel advisory for the city, encouraging people not to travel; however, he did not ban traveling.[66] On January\u00a022, he declared a \"winter weather emergency\" and told residents to \"Get done what you have to get done today ... Do not bring your vehicle out tomorrow\".[67] Taking place a year after a storm prompted the closure of the city's subway system in January\u00a02015, only to largely bypass the city, Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that services would remain running.[62] Approximately 1,800\u00a0workers equipped with 800\u00a0heaters were to keep rails clear for use.[38] Thousands of sanitation workers, 1,700\u00a0plows, and 150,000\u00a0tons of road salt were on standby to clear city roads.[38][62] He also put 600\u00a0members of the New York National Guard on standby.[67] More than 50 power workers from Vermont were dispatched to Long Island to help restore power outages.[68] Around noon on January\u00a023, owing to a significant increase in expected snowfall, Cuomo issued a travel ban for all roads in New York City and Long Island. The New York City Transit Authority suspended bus service; rail service on the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North, and Staten Island Railway; and elevated subway service (with underground subway lines remaining open until further notice). In the meantime, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed bridges and tunnels in the region.[69] The New Jersey Transit was also shut down  in preparation of the blizzard.[70] A travel ban was instituted for Newark, New Jersey, on January\u00a023 through the afternoon of January\u00a024 in light of hundreds of snow-related accidents.[71] Strong winds coupled with prolonged onshore flow resulted in a major coastal flood threat for Delaware and New Jersey. Near-shore waves were forecast to reach 15 to 20\u00a0ft (4.6 to 6.1\u00a0m) with a storm surge of 3 to 5\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.52\u00a0m).[2] In New Jersey, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for residents in coastal Barnegat Township in anticipation of significant coastal flooding; several other towns were placed under voluntary evacuation orders.[67] Delaware Governor Jack Markell declared a \"level 1 driving warning\", encouraging people not to travel and indicating drivers should be extra cautious. The Delaware Department of Transportation had 330\u00a0snow plows ready to clear roads, though many areas were expected to be impassible on January\u00a023. Shelters were also opened for the homeless.[34] In New Castle County and Kent County in Delaware the Department of Transportation and Governor Jack Markell declared a Level 2 driving restriction (essential personnel on the roads only.)[72]",
      "Southeast[edit]": "Anticipating a damaging ice storm, approximately 4,500\u00a0linemen were placed on standby to repair downed power lines in North Carolina; 1,000\u00a0state transportation workers also prepared for heavy snowfall, with crews placed on 12-hour shifts to be deployed as needed.[40] Crews from across the country arrived to assist North Carolina power companies.[48] Two million gallons of brine were used to pre-treat roads statewide.[73] Across Tennessee, state offices closed for January\u00a022, warming centers opened, and the Red Cross placed shelters on standby.[74] The Tennessee Highway Patrol asked for people to remain off the roads, saying, \"We are desperately asking you please DON'T DRIVE\".[48][75]",
      "British Isles[edit]": "The storm was forecast to cross the Atlantic Ocean and affect the British Isles from January\u00a026 to 28. The storm was expected to be less severe, with rain rather than snow; however, the possibility of strong winds and localized flooding was noted.[76] Particular concern was raised over areas that suffered from significant flooding during the preceding months.[77][78] Wind gusts as high as 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) were forecast for the Hebrides and 50 to 60\u00a0mph (80 to 97\u00a0km/h) for coastal Scotland.[79] The storm in the British Isles was far less severe than in the United States and Storm Gertrude a few days later may have been worse.[80]",
      "Impact[edit]": "The storm's widespread effects paralyzed travel across the eastern United States as it produced more than 20\u00a0in (51\u00a0cm) of snow across a large area along the Appalachian Mountains.[81] At least 55\u00a0fatalities have been attributed to the storm and its aftermath: 12 in Virginia,[82] 9 in Pennsylvania,[82] 6 in New Jersey,[83][84][85] 6 in New York,[86][87] 6 in North Carolina,[82] 4 in South Carolina,[82] 3 in Maryland,[88][89] 3 in Washington, D.C.,[90] 1 in Arkansas,[91] 1 in Delaware,[82] 1 in Georgia,[51] 1 in Kentucky,[92] 1 in Massachusetts,[51] and 1 in Ohio.[93] Throughout the affected region, more than 631,000\u00a0people lost power: 270,000 in New Jersey,[94] 147,000 in North Carolina,[95] 66,000 in Georgia,[96] 55,000 in Virginia,[97] 47,000\u00a0collectively in Delaware and Maryland,[98] and nearly 30,000 in South Carolina.[99] Economic losses\u2014from lost sales revenue and wages\u2014are estimated between $500\u00a0million and $3\u00a0billion. Moody's Analytics indicated the highest losses, stating $2.5\u20133\u00a0billion; however, the storm's occurrence on a weekend accounted for less losses than what would otherwise be expected.[100] Planalytics placed losses at $850\u00a0million and IHS Global Insight estimated losses between $500\u00a0million and $1\u00a0billion. Although an estimate was not provided, AON Benfield placed losses in the billions of dollars, noting similarities to the Blizzard of 1996 which inflicted $4.6\u00a0billion in economic losses.[101] Despite the expected major losses, the rush to buy supplies ahead of the storm's arrival may mitigate the overall impact.[102] The airline industry suffered approximately $200\u00a0million in lost revenue.[103] Using the Regional Snowfall Index, the storm ranked as a Category\u00a05, \"extreme\", storm for the Northeast and a Category\u00a04, \"crippling\", for the Southeast. It was also ranked as a Category\u00a03, \"major\", event in the Ohio Valley. Approximately 103\u00a0million people were in the storm's path,[104] including 33\u00a0million in the expected blizzard area.[105] About 21\u00a0million people in the Northeast experienced more than 20\u00a0in (51\u00a0cm) of snow. Half of the affected people were in the Northeast (which includes the Northeast megalopolis); the storm's RSI reached 20.138 in this region, the fourth-highest on record for the region. The primary factor driving its high classification was the affected population. The storm's RSI of 13.776 in the Southeast was the twelfth-highest on record.[104]",
      "Severe weather on the Gulf Coast[edit]": "During January\u00a021 through the early hours of January\u00a022, severe thunderstorms brought damaging winds and hail to portions of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.[106] Five tornadoes touched down across Mississippi: an EF0 near Crystal Springs, an EF0 near Homewood, an EF1 near Loyd Star, an EF1 near Pinola, and an EF2 near Sumrall. Numerous trees and power lines were downed, multiple structures were damaged, and a few were destroyed by the tornadoes.[107] Straight line winds near Improve, Lamar County, Mississippi, significantly damaged 10\u201312\u00a0homes. Hail reached 2.75\u00a0in (7.0\u00a0cm) in diameter in Wilmer, Louisiana. The most significant damage occurred overnight across the Florida Panhandle and neighboring Alabama. Winds gusting to 73\u00a0mph (117\u00a0km/h) downed numerous trees and power lines and damaged structures.[106]",
      "Southeastern states[edit]": "Snow fell across a large portion of Arkansas on January\u00a021\u201322,[73] with a daily record of 7.2\u00a0in (18\u00a0cm) observed just outside Little Rock.[108][109] Snowfall was confined to the eastern half of the state, with freezing rain amounting to 0.25\u00a0in (6.4\u00a0mm) observed in northeastern counties.[110] Strong winds in excess of 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h)\u2014with a gust of 47\u00a0mph (76\u00a0km/h) measured in Jonesboro\u2014left more than 16,000\u00a0people in the state without power.[73] One fatality near Hoxie was due to slippery roads.[91] Early on January\u00a022, heavy snow fell across parts of western Tennessee. Roads around Nashville quickly became impassable, including portions of Interstates 40 and 24, and local police reported more than 200\u00a0accidents.[62] In Lexington, Kentucky, one accident led to injury; 17 other accidents were reported.[73] Multiple accidents in Rockcastle County prompted the closure of 12\u00a0mi (19\u00a0km) of I-75 in Kentucky.[36] Along a 35-mile (56\u00a0km) stretch of Interstate 75 in Kentucky, hundreds of drivers became stranded for more than 16\u00a0hours on January\u00a022\u201323. In a separate incident, an 11-mile (18\u00a0km) stretch of Interstate 77 in West Virginia was blocked by stuck tractor-trailers that were lying across the highway.[105]  The National Guard was deployed to provide people with food, water, and fuel.[111] A transportation worker died when his truck skidded off icy roads.[92] Treacherous road conditions in North Carolina resulted in at least 571\u00a0accidents and 800\u00a0\"service calls\" from police.[73] Five deaths were reported across the state.[112] One person died in a collision on Interstate 95. Numerous roads were shut down accordingly.[73] One person was killed and three others were injured in Forsyth County. An accident along Interstate 77 near Troutman resulted in the death of a 4-year-old boy.[113] Freezing rain resulted in widespread power outages, bringing down numerous trees and power lines in the state. Many roads closed because of debris, including portions of Interstate 40 in Johnston County. Approximately 147,000\u00a0people lost power in North Carolina, with Wake County accounting for 50,000 of the total.[95] Four people died in South Carolina: two from carbon monoxide poisoning in Greenville, one in a car accident on an icy road in Greenville County, and another from an accident in Jonesville.[82][114] Nearly 30,000\u00a0people lost power in the state.[99] Portions of Interstates 26 and 95 were temporarily shut down for icy conditions.[115] Flurries were observed as far south as the coastal regions of the state, including the ACE Basin as well as Charleston.[116] Upwards of 8\u00a0in (20\u00a0cm) of snow fell across Georgia, with the highest totals confined to northern parts of the state. High winds downed trees and power lines, leaving approximately 66,000\u00a0people without power across the state.[96] A postal worker was killed when strong winds blew a large branch off a tree, crushing him in his car.[51] Snow fell as far south as Mobile, Alabama,[117] with additional flurries extending into Jacksonville and Gainesville along the Florida Panhandle late on January\u00a022. Temperatures in Gainesville fell to 28\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C).[118] Further south in Florida, record rain of 4.79\u00a0in (122\u00a0mm) fell in West Palm Beach.[119]",
      "Mid-Atlantic states[edit]": "Maximum snow depth was measured at 42\u00a0in (110\u00a0cm) in Glengary, West Virginia, on January\u00a024.[120] Baltimore, Maryland, recorded its largest snowfall on record.[121] Two people died from heart attacks while shoveling snow and a third from undetermined causes across Maryland.[88][89] A large portion of the Ocean City fishing pier was destroyed by rough seas and high winds.[122] West Virginia's emergency management reported Interstate 77 to be \"completely shut down\" following an accident involving semi-trailers. The National Guard was called in to assist clearing the stranded vehicles.[105] Six people died from snow-related incidents in Virginia.[123] Virginia State Police responded to 989\u00a0accidents and 793\u00a0disabled vehicles through the evening of January\u00a022.[105] A total of 12\u00a0people died in storm-related incidents across Virginia.[82] One person died when their car skid off a road in Chesapeake and collided with a tree.[112] Five people died from hypothermia: one each in Charles City, Gloucester County, Hampton, Henry County, and Wise County.[82][124] A combination of snow and ice accumulation caused the roof of Donk's Theatre in Hudgins, Virginia, to collapse; the structure was deemed a total loss and will be demolished.[125] The roof of a 4,700\u00a0ft2 (437\u00a0m2) building collapsed in Charlottesville.[97] Seven people required hospitalization for carbon monoxide poisoning at an apartment complex in Herndon when vents became clogged with snow.[126] The snow completely destroyed two parking lots at Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge.[127] Three people died while shoveling snow in Washington, D.C.[90] Snow-related incidents resulted in nine deaths across Pennsylvania.[82] In Harrisburg, snowfall from the storm was reported as 30.2\u00a0in (77\u00a0cm), breaking the city's previous record snowfall of 25\u00a0in (64\u00a0cm) which was set in February\u00a01983.[128] Near Bedford, approximately 500 vehicles became stuck along a westbound stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike for over 24 hours from January 22\u201323 near the eastern approach to the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Among the stranded vehicles were one bus carrying the Duquesne University men's basketball team and another carrying Temple University's women's gymnastics team.[129] Despite the scale of the incident, no major injuries were reported.[130] The band Guster, stranded in Pittsburgh by the blocking of the turnpike, held an impromptu concert in an alley.[131] Four people died while shoveling snow: two in both Lancaster and Montgomery counties.[132][133][134] One of the dead in Montgomery County was a woman who was 8-months pregnant; the baby was declared dead on-scene when paramedics arrived.[132][135] Another man died from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car in Reading after a passing snow plow buried his car in snow.[136] One person died in Magnolia, Delaware, after suffering a heart attack while shoveling.[82] A power outage at the Delaware City Refinery, thought to be related to the storm, forced the facility to shut down after chemicals were released.[137] A mother and her 1-year-old son died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Passaic, New Jersey, after snowfall blocked their vehicle's tailpipe; a 3-year-old girl was hospitalized,[138][139] but later died on January\u00a027.[85] Three other people died while attempting to walk home during the blizzard: one each in East Greenwich Township, Hackensack, and Mahwah.[83][84] Snowfall across New York City and Long Island was more intense than initially forecast, falling at rates of 3\u00a0in (7.6\u00a0cm) per hour at times. Before the travel ban was implemented, buses struggled to make their routes and long delays were common.[140] At Central Park, a storm-total accumulation of 27.5\u00a0in (69.8\u00a0cm) was observed, the highest total on record for the city since observations began in 1869. This surpassed the previous record of 26.9\u00a0in (68.3\u00a0cm) measured during the February\u00a02006 blizzard.[141][142] The snowstorm made January 2016 the 2nd snowiest January in New York City history, while tying it with February 1934 for the 6th snowiest month.[143] Accumulations reached an all-time record high of 30.5\u00a0in (77\u00a0cm) at John F. Kennedy International Airport.[120][142] Police across New York City responded to more than 200\u00a0accidents and 300\u00a0disabled vehicles.[112] Emergency personnel responded to about 3,000\u00a09-1-1 calls across the city. Five people died while shoveling snow: two in Queens, two in unknown parts of the city, and one in Staten Island.[86][144] At least two deaths in Long Island were from shoveling snow.[145] One person was killed by a snow plow in Oyster Bay Cove on Long Island.[87]",
      "Coastal flooding[edit]": "Significant coastal flooding took place in Delaware and New Jersey.[146] The first, and most severe, round of flooding took place during the morning of January\u00a023. A second round took place after the storm's passage on the morning of January\u00a024, concurrent with high tide.[147] Record tides occurred in Lewes, Delaware.[148] Approximately 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) of dunes along Delaware's 24\u00a0mi (39\u00a0km) oceanfront coast sustained significant damage, with many areas flattened.[149] Forty people required evacuation in Long Neck and Oak Orchard.[150] Delaware Route 1 was shut down between Bethany Beach and Dewey Beach for flooding.[151] Tides at Cape May, New Jersey, reached a record 9.26\u00a0ft (2.82\u00a0m), surpassing the previous highest of 8.67\u00a0ft (2.64\u00a0m) set during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.[148] Fifty people required evacuation in Atlantic City,[105] and at least 150\u00a0homes were flooded.[152] Strong winds accompanying the flooding caused damage to many homes.[148] Streets in Ocean City and Stone Harbor were inundated with several feet of water; according to a resident in Stone Harbor, water reached 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) in depth on some streets. Effects were most severe along the Delaware Bay.[153] Combined with snowfall and freezing temperatures, the flooded roads became a mix of ice and slush.[147] Long Beach Island, still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Sandy, sustained severe beach erosion.[154] The storm's tide and waves carved 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) cliffs along coastal beaches.[152] A recently constructed dune in Belmar held back most of the water, with one minor breach along its 1.3\u00a0mi (2.1\u00a0km) expanse.[147]",
      "New England[edit]": "Southern New England experienced significant snow accumulations from Jan 23 to Jan 24. Around a foot of snow fell across Southern Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Southeastern Massachusetts. Blizzard conditions affected southeastern Massachusetts for several hours, with Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard reporting such conditions for four hours. Blizzard conditions were reported in Bridgeport for 4 hours lasting from 8 am to 12 pm.[155] Snow totals reached 16.0 in (40.6 cm) in Norwalk, Connecticut and 13.0 in (33.0 cm) on Block Island, Rhode Island. Wind gusts on Block Island reached 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h) while gusts in New Haven reached 52 mph (83 km/h).[156] One person died after being struck by a snow plow.[51]",
      "Newfoundland and Nova Scotia[edit]": "After leaving the Eastern United States, the storm complex brought light snowfall to coastal areas of Nova Scotia, Canada, on January\u00a024. Environment Canada indicated accumulations up to 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) alongside wind gusts of 30 to 70\u00a0km/h (19 to 43\u00a0mph). Residents, however, reported up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) of snow in Shelburne County.[157] Street parking was banned in Halifax on select streets to enable easier clearing of roads.[158] On January\u00a025, a Boeing 767 traveling from Miami, Florida, to Milan, Italy, encountered severe turbulence produced by the storm about 480\u00a0km (300\u00a0mi) off Newfoundland. Of the 203\u00a0people on board, including crew, seven were injured. The aircraft made an emergency landing at St. John's International Airport.[159]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "Many cities struggled to cope with the snowfall, including Washington, D.C., where schools and government offices remained closed through January\u00a026, three days after the storm. Schools in Baltimore, Maryland, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, also remained closed through January\u00a026.[3] Side streets around the D.C. area were unplowed through January\u00a026.[160] Through January\u00a027, Washington, D.C. police issued $1,078,000 worth of parking tickets and $65,600 in fines for vehicles parked or abandoned on snow emergency routes. At least 656\u00a0vehicles were towed.[161] The New York Post described Queens, New York, as \"basically forgotten\" on January\u00a025 as roads remained covered with snow.[3][162] Many residents complained that snowplows did not come through their area until at least a day after the storm passed. Crews expressed that certain areas, such as in the Bronx, were difficult to navigate with snow plows and there was no place to put the snow. A resident of Pelham Bay stated that 3-1-1 operators were not picking up calls. Mayor De Blasio toured areas of Staten Island on January\u00a024 and urged people to be patient.[163] In contrast, both Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio were praised for their handling of the storm prior to its arrival, and for being the first to issue a travel ban, which is credited for potentially saving lives.[164] New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who flew back to the state from New Hampshire during his presidential campaign, left to resume campaigning shortly after the storm passed. He was criticized for his quick departure and heated responses to questions about why he left the state. He stated that while there was some locally significant flood damage in Southern New Jersey, the overall effects across the state did not warrant his presence. He responded to one person by saying, \"I don't know what you expect me to do. You want me to go down there with a mop?\"[165][166] A Stockton University graduate started up a fund to provide 1,000\u00a0mops to Christie in response to his comment.[167] On January\u00a026, Christie apologized to North Wildwood Mayor Patrick Rosenello for calling him \"crazy\" during his response to criticism the day prior. Christie also requested that Rosenello apologize on his behalf to first responders, residents, and business owners.[168] In March, President Barack Obama declared Delaware,[169] Maryland,[170] New Jersey,[171] Pennsylvania,[172] Virginia,[173] and Washington, D.C., major disaster areas.[174] The federal funding would only cover costs incurred by public infrastructure, debris removal, and emergency measures to ensure public safety.[175][176] Preliminary estimates places the total cost of assistance at $168,334,023,[nb 1] with New Jersey accounting for $82,663,604.[177]",
      "Snowfall measurement reviews[edit]": "Following the storm, the National Weather Service conducted a review of eight snowfall observations following concerns over their quality. Measurements from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Dulles International Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport were verified as reliable.[141] The total at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport was brought into question immediately following the blizzard as the snow observers lost their measuring board during the storm;[178] however, the assessment determined that proper procedure was continued even after the board was lost and the total was considered accurate. A review of measurements at Central Park, New York,  revealed the 26.8\u00a0in (68\u00a0cm) observation was the result of a communication error and revised the storm-total to 27.5\u00a0in (70\u00a0cm)\u2014an all-time record for New York City. Furthermore, the 28.1\u00a0in (71\u00a0cm) measurement at Newark International Airport, New Jersey, was invalidated due to measurements being taken every hour instead of every six hours thus inflating the total.[141] The State Climate Extremes Committee also conducted a review of a potential 24-hour state snowfall record at Mount Mitchell in North Carolina. Their results showed the 24-hour observation of 41\u00a0in (100\u00a0cm) to be in error, erroneously inflating the snowfall totals. Properly adjusting for liquid snow ratios, the total was revised to 21\u00a0in (53\u00a0cm). The storm-total accumulation was also revised from 66\u00a0in (170\u00a0cm) to 33\u00a0in (84\u00a0cm).[179]",
      "Snowfall accumulations and records[edit]": "",
      "Naming[edit]": "The storm has received several nicknames from various media outlets. The name Winter Storm Jonas was created by The Weather Channel at the beginning of the winter storm season, and assigned to the storm system when it was forecast; it has also been used in international media,[185] and was used by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio[186] and the United States Postal Service.[187] Reception of the naming of storms has been mixed; The New York Times refers to the name \"Jonas\" as a marketing ploy while The Weather Channel maintains that it helps others prepare in advance.[188] The Washington Post named the storm Snowzilla, referencing the 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event which has been named the \"Godzilla El Ni\u00f1o\".[189][190] Connecticut-based WFSB named the system Anna, after former First Lady Anna Harrison.[191] Other sources have dubbed the storm simply Blizzard of 2016 or Blizzard 2016.[192]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Typhoon Nida (2004)": "Typhoon Nida, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Dindo, was the fourth tropical cyclone and second named storm of the 2004 Pacific typhoon season.[1] Nida was the second super typhoon of the 2004 season, reaching a peak intensity of 160 miles per hour (260\u00a0km/h). Forming southeast of the Philippines, the storm strengthened as it moved northwest. The typhoon brushed the eastern Philippines causing heavy rains across the island archipelago. Nida later accelerated northeast, missing Japan to the east while becoming an extratropical cyclone. A total of $1.3 million (2004 USD) in damage occurred, and Nida left 31 fatalities.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On May\u00a012, a persistent area of thunderstorms formed within a monsoon trough 220 miles (350\u00a0km) southwest of Palau. Satellite imagery revealed a weak low-level circulation. Initially, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) forecast the storm to not strengthen. The following day, forecasters saw that the storm was strengthening and upgraded the system to tropical depression status. Forecasters at the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration designated the storm as Tropical Depression Dindo.[2] At the time of formation, the depression was located 190 miles (310\u00a0km) east of Palau as it moved west northwest at 3\u00a0mph (4.8\u00a0km/h). Quickscat satellite imagery showed the depression's winds were near 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h) and increasing. Satellite imagery later the showed deep convection organizing over the low-level circulation. The depression underwent rapid intensification as it became a tropical storm late in the morning on May\u00a014 and was assigned the name Nida by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Still intensifying, the storm turned northwest where it reached typhoon status later that night.[2] Curving west-northwest at 7\u00a0mph (11\u00a0km/h), Typhoon Nida attained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h), equivalent to a Category\u00a03 hurricane. On May\u00a016, Nida became a super typhoon as its winds reached 165\u00a0mph (266\u00a0km/h). At its peak, its highest winds extended 35 miles (56\u00a0km) from the center. Satellite imagery showed the storm developed a defined eye measuring 25 miles (40\u00a0km) wide. On May\u00a017, the center of Nida passed over Catanduanes Island, Philippines.[2] After making landfall, Nida weakened and then turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high cirrostratus clouds, indicative of the weakening typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.[2] Nida accelerated northeast and its maximum sustained winds weakened to 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). Interacting with an upper level low pressure system over Japan, the typhoon became elongated. Nida weakened below typhoon strength as the center passed 290 miles (470\u00a0km) south of Tokyo, Japan. By May\u00a021, Nida transitioned to an extratropical cyclone. The JMA continued to track the remnants of Nida as it weakened northeast of northern Japan.[2]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "In the Philippines, evacuation centers were opened to accommodate 2,986 people. The typhoon approach cancelled ferry operations stranding 15,057 passengers.[2] In Taiwan, forecasters at the Central Weather Bureau issued a typhoon warning as forecast models predicted a high probability of the typhoon hitting Taiwan. The warnings interrupted the preparations for the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian.[3] In the Philippines, winds were clocked at 100 knots (190\u00a0km/h) at Virac. on Catanduanes Island at 6 a.m. local time on May 17. The pressure at that location fell to 965 millibars (28.5\u00a0inHg).[4]  Structural damage was severe as the typhoon damaged or destroyed over 700\u20134,000\u00a0homes displacing 11,000\u00a0people. In Guimba, Nueva Ecija, Nida spawned a tornado that caused moderate damage. After the storm, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo placed eight providences under a state of emergency. Nida produced heavy rainfall across the eastern Philippines. Rainfall up to 10.6 inches (270\u00a0mm) was reported in Ombao while Naga City received 5.9 inches (150\u00a0mm) of rain. The rest of the Philippines received 104 to 372 millimetres (4.1 to 14.6\u00a0in) of rain.[2][4] 31\u00a0fatalities (20 confirmed, 11 unaccounted for) were reported during Nida's landfall. In Camotes island, nine people drowned and five were declared missing when a ferry boat sank during the storm. Elsewhere offshore, 13\u00a0crewmen were rescued when their ship ran aground near Luzon.[5] In all, the typhoon left $1.3\u00a0million in damage across the eastern Philippines.[6] In Japan, heavy rains produced by the outer bands of Nida triggered flash flooding and landslides in Fukushima Prefecture. Several highways were shut down due to rising waters or debris and a few homes also were inundated.[7] In Mito, Ibaraki, 360 homes were left without power after high winds knocked down electrical wires. A 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) section of highway in the city also collapsed.[8] In addition to the structural damage caused by Nida, the poor weather conditions created during its passage resulted in several canceled flights by Japan Air Commuter.[9] In Minamidait\u014d, Okinawa, a weather station operated by the WMO reported winds gusting to 71\u00a0mph (114\u00a0km/h) and a barometric pressure of 972 millibars (28.7\u00a0inHg). Rainfall total at the station was 1.25 inches (32\u00a0mm) with the highest at 2.79 inches (71\u00a0mm). There were no reports of damage.[2]",

      "2022 Southern Cone heat wave": " In mid-January 2022, the Southern Cone had a severe heat wave, which made the region for a while the hottest place on earth, with temperatures exceeding those of the Middle East.[1][2] This extreme weather event was associated with the Atlantic anticyclone,[3] a particularly intense La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean, and the regional effects of climate change.[4][5] Several cities had high temperatures over 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), setting records for hot days.[6] In addition, thousands of hectares were destroyed by wildfires across the region.[7][8]",
      "By country[edit]": "",
      "Argentina[edit]": "On January 10, the temperatures were \"particularly anomalous\" in the south of the Pampas region and the north of Patagonia.[9] According to the Servicio Meteorol\u00f3gico Nacional (SMN), that day maximum temperature records were broken in Tres Arroyos 40.7\u00a0\u00b0C (105.3\u00a0\u00b0F) and Coronel Pringles 39.6\u00a0\u00b0C (103.3\u00a0\u00b0F), along with other records that ranged between 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) and 43\u00a0\u00b0C (109\u00a0\u00b0F) in the region. However, a few days later those same marks were surpassed, with 41.8\u00a0\u00b0C (107.2\u00a0\u00b0F) in Tres Arroyos and 40.1\u00a0\u00b0C (104.2\u00a0\u00b0F) in Coronel Pringles.[10] On January 11, Buenos Aires reached 41.1\u00a0\u00b0C (106.0\u00a0\u00b0F), which was the second maximum temperature at the moment since there are systematic records.[11] That day almost 45.0\u00a0\u00b0C (113.0\u00a0\u00b0F) were registered in San Juan, a few tenths of the monthly record for January.[12] On January 12 the city saw 3 heat-related deaths.[13] On January 14, Buenos Aires reached 41.5\u00a0\u00b0C (106.7\u00a0\u00b0F), which became the second highest temperature recorded, surpassing that recorded three days earlier.[14] During the wave, new electric energy consumption records were set at the national level, above 28,000 MW.[15] On January 11, a massive blackout affected 700,000 users in the north of Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires.[16] To avoid blackouts, the Argentine government asked the industrial sector to reduce energy demand between January 13 and 14, with the aim of being able to provide energy to the home network.[17] In addition, it decreed teleworking for two days for public employees and urged provincial governments to take similar measures.[18] During the most intense week of the heat wave, Argentina imported energy from Brazil and Uruguay.[19] In the midst of the heat wave, and after important fires registered in the previous weeks, especially in Patagonia, the national government declared a fire emergency throughout the country for one year.[20] Fires were recorded in the grasslands and wooded area near Canning and Trist\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez, in Ezeiza, which affected some 130 hectares.[21] In Corrientes, a series of wildfires took place, which consumed around 800,000 hectares, which is equivalent to approximately ten percent of the province.[22]",
      "Uruguay[edit]": "Initially, the Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (INUMET) issued an alert for the heat wave in the north, center and west of the country, but on January 13 it was extended to the entire country.[23] That day, the maximum temperature of 42.5\u00a0\u00b0C (108.5\u00a0\u00b0F) was reached in the northern city of Salto, being the hottest January day since 1961.[24][25] On January 14, Florida reached 44\u00a0\u00b0C (111\u00a0\u00b0F), the highest temperature ever recorded in the country, matching a 1943 record.[26] 14 of the 19 departments of the country reached a temperature above 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) during the wave.[27] The heat wave affected the generation of wind power due to the lack of wind, which resulted in 50% of the electrical energy having to be generated with the thermal power stations of the National Administration of Power Plants and Electrical Transmissions (UTE).[28] On January 14, a blackout affected around 25,000 electricity network users in the Canelones, Montevideo and Treinta y Tres departments.[29] On that day the country's energy consumption record was broken, reaching 2,139 MW.[30] After four days of heat wave, the National Directorate of Firefighters reported more than 100 active fires in different parts of the country, such as Paysand\u00fa and Rio Negro.[31][32][33] This weather event intensified the drought, which had triggered a declaration of \"agricultural emergency\" in December 2021.[34][35] In addition, it caused the death of 400,000 chickens, for an estimated value of 1.5 million dollars,[36] due to this, the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries declared the \"poultry emergency\".[37]",

      "Hurricane Dot (1959)": " Hurricane Dot was a powerful hurricane which affected Hawaii in August 1959, making it, at the time, the costliest tropical cyclone in Hawaiian history. Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawai\u02bbi on August\u00a01.[nb 1] The storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July\u00a024\u201327, but was never confirmed due to a lack of ship reports. Dot was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August\u00a03, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h). Intensity leveled off afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August\u00a05, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August\u00a08. Dot produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed south of the Big Island, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu, resulting in minor damage. In Oahu, some homes along the coast were unroofed, and damage from wave action was also reported. Damage from these four islands totaled US$150,000, and two indirect deaths occurred in Lanai. Extensive damage occurred on Kauai as Dot made landfall, producing wind gusts as high as 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) and toppling trees and power lines. Widespread power outages affected the island, causing telecommunications and water systems to fail. Although infrastructure was damaged to an extent by floodwater and strong winds, crops suffered the most losses. Cane sugar crops sustained US$2.7\u00a0million in losses. Overall, damage from Dot across Hawaii totaled US$6\u00a0million, and a disaster area declaration and state of emergency took effect for the archipelago after the hurricane's passage.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On July\u00a024, the SS Pacificus encountered a storm with maximum sustained winds meeting the threshold of tropical storm status roughly 1,000\u00a0mi (1,600\u00a0km) west of the Baja California Peninsula.[1] Despite reports that the location of the system remained vague, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center\u00a0(JTWC) began issuing tropical cyclone advisories and warnings on the unnamed disturbance.[2] Tracking west-northwestward, the tropical storm peaked with winds reported at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) shortly after its discovery; however, the JTWC discontinued its monitoring of the cyclone on July\u00a027 due to a lack of ship reports confirming the location of the tropical storm.[1] At 1800\u00a0UTC on August\u00a01, an unidentified ship roughly 950\u00a0mi (1,550\u00a0km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii reported 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) winds within a storm, prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Dot. Despite an apparent correlation between Dot and the preceding unnamed tropical cyclone, the lack of ship reports between July\u00a027 and August\u00a01 prevented the agency from confirming that the two systems were the same.[2] Nonetheless, development upon designation was rapid as the system tracked westward, with reports from the SS Sonoma indicating that Dot had intensified to hurricane strength by August\u00a02.[1][3] Rapid intensification continued, and at 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a03, reconnaissance aircraft found winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.11\u00a0inHg), making Dot a Category\u00a04 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[2] Later analysis indicated that these figures constituted the hurricane's peak intensity.[3] After peaking, Dot slightly weakened, but maintained its Category\u00a04 status for more than two days; during that time it boasted an unusually large eye spanning as much as 40\u00a0mi (65\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] Late on August\u00a04, a fourth reconnaissance flight into the storm found surface winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h),[2] but this reading was discounted on the basis that pressures were unusually high for a storm of that intensity. On August\u00a05, Dot passed 90\u00a0mi (145\u00a0km) south of Ka Lae before the storm curved sharply towards the northwest late that day. A more definite weakening phase began after this point, and during the night of August\u00a06,[1] Dot made landfall on Kauai with winds estimated at 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h), making the storm a Category\u00a01-equivalent at the time of landfall. After traversing the island, Dot was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and curved back to the west, before eventually dissipating on August\u00a08.[3]",
      "Preparations, impact, and aftermath[edit]": "On August\u00a03, the United States Weather Bureau issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas of the Big Island in Kau and Puna districts. As Dot swept by the Hawaiian islands, various gale warnings and small craft warnings shifted westward to reflect the hurricane's predicted path. Due to the storm's sudden northward shift in movement, hurricane warnings were issued for portions of Oahu and the Kauai channel before being issued for only the island of Kauai. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August\u00a07 after Dot weakened below hurricane intensity.[4] Disaster workers in Oahu and Kauai were warned by civil defense agencies and the American Red Cross to prepare for emergency. Roughly 400\u00a0people fled from the beaches of Kauai due to the threat of storm surge,[5] with an additional 500\u00a0people being evacuated by authorities as the storm neared the island.[6] After the storm caused flooding in Kauai, nearly 1,000\u00a0people evacuated out of submerged areas into schools, armories, and public facilities repurposed as emergency shelters.[7] Passing well to the south of the Big Island, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and Oahu, damage from Dot on these islands was minor.[8] Rainfall on the Big Island peaking at 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) caused localized flooding in some areas, while wave damage occurred at Ka Lae and along the island's Kona coast.[1] Winds at a station on Ka Lae reached 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[2] Flooding also occurred on Oahu, and along the coast homes were unroofed and cars were damaged by flying projectiles after being subjected to winds estimated at 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[1] Off of Lanai, a tugboat captain was indirectly killed after he slipped between two boats in rough seas while attempting to board another ship, crushing him. Another indirect death occurred on Lanai in a traffic incident resulting from Dot's rainfall.[6] Damage on the Hawaiian islands outside of Kauai was estimated at $150,000.[1] Rough surf along the coasts of Kauai combined with torrential rainfall to produce widespread coastal flooding.[1] Waves at Port Allen peaked at 35\u00a0ft (10.7\u00a0m).[9] Pineapple plantations were inundated, with losses exceeding US$200,000. Infrastructure damage as a result of wave action was spotty but nonetheless amounted to US$100,000.[1] The August\u00a01959 rainfall total in Lihue, largely attributed to Dot, measured 8.13\u00a0in (207\u00a0mm), 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) in excess of normal.[10] The heavy rainfall caused rivers and streams to swell and inundate adjacent areas.[2] Despite making landfall as a weak Category\u00a01 hurricane,[3] Dot brought damaging winds inland, with a maximum wind gust of 103\u00a0mph (166\u00a0km/h) reported at Kilauea Light. However, gusts as high as 125\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h) were estimated given the snapping of palm trees. Strong winds damaged hundreds of buildings in the areas of Kilauea, Lihue, and Lawai, Hawaii.[1] Extensive losses resulted from the damaging and toppling of macadamia trees.[1] However, of the crops on Kauai, cane suffered the greatest impact with damage figures reaching US$2.7\u00a0million.[8] The toppling of power lines caused power outages across the island; fallen lines also blocked roads.[2] Water supply to some communities failed due to the lack of electricity.[11] With the exception of emergency radio transmitters, telecommunications on Kauai failed.[12] The damage toll from Dot for the entirety of Hawai\u02bbi totaled US$6\u00a0million, making the hurricane the costliest in Hawaiian history before it was surpassed by hurricanes Iwa, Iniki and Iselle in 1982, 1992 and 2014, respectively. Adjusted for inflation, Dot's damage figure nears US$50\u00a0million.[13] Due to the damage wrought by Dot on Kauai, the island was declared a major disaster area.[14] Stepping in for governor William F. Quinn, Hawaiian secretary Edward E. Johnston declared a state of emergency for Hawaii and allocated funds towards the repairing of roads and public property.[15] The United States Weather Bureau awarded the SS Sonoma a public service award on October\u00a07, 1959 for serving as reconnaissance for Hurricane Dot throughout its existence.[16]",

      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical depression located near the Caroline Islands was first spotted July 27. It moved slowly to the northwest, gradually intensifying along the Philippine Sea. On July 31, it crossed northern Luzon,[1] and entered the northernmost part of the South China Sea.[2] It then intensified more and made landfall on the Chinese coast near the city of Shantou (formerly romanized as Swatow) late on August 2 or early on August 3.[1] It quickly dissipated inland later. The minimum known central pressure of this typhoon is 27.53 inches of mercury (932\u00a0mb).[3] At one point, the winds were estimated to have a speed exceeding 100\u00a0mph.[4]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Due to the typhoon passing through a then-lightly inhabited part of the Philippines, no reports of significant impact were received.[3] In Shantou, the typhoon caused a storm surge of at least 12\u00a0ft above normal.[4] The rain was heavy, and left enough water to leave the land saturated for a few days.[13] Shantou was an unfortunate city, as around 5,000 people (out of a population of about 65,000) perished in the storm.[1] Some nearby villages were totally destroyed.[14] Several ships near the coast were totally wrecked.[4] Other ones were blown as far as two miles inland.[14] The area around the city had around another 50,000 casualties.[4] The total death toll was above 60,000,[15] and may have been higher than 100,000.[4] The 50,000 to 100,000 deaths\u2013100,000+ deaths caused by this typhoon make it one of the deadliest tropical cyclones in the western north Pacific Ocean.

      "Tropical Storm Nestor (2019)": " Tropical Storm Nestor was a large but short-lived and disorganized tropical storm which caused widespread tornadoes and heavy rain in the Southeastern United States during mid-October 2019. The sixteenth depression and fourteenth named storm of the erratic 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Nestor originated from a broad area of low pressure over the Western Caribbean. It emerged in the Gulf of Mexico and began to organize slightly, becoming Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen due to its threat to the Southeastern United States. It gained a sufficient enough of a circulation to be designated Tropical Storm Nestor near the Florida Panhandle early on October 18, crawling to the northeast, and then finally transitioning into an extratropical cyclone due to strong shear from a nearby upper-level low before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle on October 19.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On October 10, the NHC began to monitor for a poorly defined area of low pressure that was forecast to form near Central America.[1] The low developed on October 11 and meandered almost parallel to the coast of Honduras for the next few days,[2] before finally crossing over Central America near the Yucatan Peninsula on October 14.[3] The low fully emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 16 after bringing heavy rain to Central America and due to the warm temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico at the time, convection significantly improved with the system near the center and it was given a medium chance of development.[4]  The system became very broad but proceeded to be designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen the proceeding day due to its threat to the United States Gulf Coast.[5] The disturbance intensified over the following hours, attaining winds up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h), with cloud tops colder than -80\u00b0 enveloping the center.[6] The disturbance's circulation, however remained elongated, and was still not named. Later that evening on October 18, the circulation improved and became more defined, while the system was finally designated Tropical Storm Nestor.[7] Nestor began to then accelerate to the northeast aided by a ridge to its northeast, although wind shear generated by a nearby trough almost embedded within the northern side of the cyclone began to give Nestor a lopsided appearance on satellite imagery shortly after its designation.[8][9] Due to Nestor's broad nature, gale-force winds were already beginning to be observed near the coast of Florida Panhandle.[10] The system began to slow down as wind shear generated by the trough caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Florida Panhandle coast. Nestor rapidly lost its tropical characteristics due to interaction with this trough, and was declared to have become an extratropical cyclone early on October 19, however still bringing storm surge and heavy rains to the coast anyway.[11] Nestor's post-tropical remnant then made landfall in St. Vincent Island, Florida with winds up to 45\u00a0mph,[12] becoming further disorganized across the Southeastern United States for the next couple of days. On October 21, Nestor's extratropical remnant was absorbed into another extratropical storm off the coast of the Southeastern United States.",
      "Preparations[edit]": "With the designation of Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen, the National Weather Service (NWS) issued Tropical Storm Warnings and Watches for the majority of the Florida Panhandle coast. Storm Surge Watches were also issued ahead of the storm.[13] Parts of Southern Louisiana and Alabama also received Tropical Storm Warnings, but were removed shortly after the storm's track shifted predominantly towards to the Florida Panhandle.[8] Tornado watches were then issued shortly after the storm became post-tropical for much of Northern Florida and some parts of Georgia.[14]",
      "Impacts[edit]": "As Nestor began to approach the coast of the Florida Panhandle, the same region that was severely affected by Hurricane Michael the previous year, it led to winds to gale-force and storm surge to take upon the region.[10] Tides 2\u20134 feet above normal were recorded in several parts of the region as well, causing some minor coastal flooding. Heavy rain and the surging waves generated by the storm system also caused flash flooding in parts of the region, with some areas topping with 4 inches of rain.[16] These rains, however, proved to be somewhat beneficial. A drought in the Southeastern United States was relieved as Nestor and its post-tropical remnant brought rain to the areas, with a meteorologist stating \"The rain on the whole was a positive for the entire region \u2013 unless you had outdoor plans.\".[17] Perhaps the legacy of Nestor, however, was the small tornado outbreak it caused across the Southeastern United States. Although Nestor was not classified as a tropical cyclone anymore at the time of its landfall, it spawned numerous supercells, which ultimately led to the spawning of several tornadoes. The National Weather Service (NWS) confirmed six tornadoes, one reaching EF2 status.[16] One of the tornadoes, only reaching EF0 status, was recorded in Seminole, Florida and damaged a mobile home park.[18] An EF2 tornado which tracked 9 miles also touched down in western Polk County, damaging over 50 homes and other buildings, including a middle school. The tornado also overturned an 18-wheeled vehicle which fell on top of a SUV, but no injuries were reported.[19] The next day, an EF1 tornado formed near Cape Coral in Lee County damaging several homes. No injuries or deaths were reported from any of the tornadoes.[20][21] An EF0 landspout tornado was sighted in Micco, but it caused no damage.[22] One other EF0\u00a0tornado was confirmed in Cordele, Georgia, downing trees, shifting a barn off it foundation, and ripping part of a metal roof off an industrial building.[23] Another EF0\u00a0tornado was confirmed on October 20 on the west side of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, snapping and uprooting numerous trees, including fallen pine trees that damaged to two mobile homes.[24] 3 indirect deaths occurred when heavy rains generated by Nestor's extratropical remnant caused a car crash in South Carolina.[25]",

      "Hurricane Orlene (2022)": " Hurricane Orlene was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused minor damage to the Pacific coast of Mexico in October 2022. The cyclone was the sixteenth named storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2022 Pacific hurricane season. Orlene originated from a low-pressure area off the coast of Mexico. Moving towards the north, Orlene gradually strengthened, becoming a hurricane on October\u00a01 and reaching its peak intensity the following day with winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h). Orlene made landfall  just north of the Nayarit and Sinaloa border, with winds of 85\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h). Soon afterward, Orlene rapidly weakened and became a tropical depression, eventually dissipating over the Sierra Madre Occidental late on October\u00a04. Orlene prompted the issuance of hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings for Northwestern Mexico.[2] The storm's knocked out power to nearly 49,092 customers in two states.[3] Orlene caused minor damage to many schools.[4] Damage in San Blas was estimated to be in excess of MX$12 million (US$600,000).[5]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On September 25, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the possible development of a low-pressure area located several miles offshore the south of the Southwestern Mexico coast which was conducive for further tropical cyclogenesis[6]  The low produced a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.[7] Satellite imagery showed that the associated shower activity was showing signs of organization.[8] By September 29, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Sixteen-E.[9] Six hours later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, and was assigned the name Orlene.[10] Orlene become better organized, with a small central dense overcast forming.[11] There was a burst of deep convection and a gradual increase in satellite presentation.[12] Microwave imagery revealed a well-defined curved band wrapping into a developing inner core.[13] Orlene strengthened into a hurricane at 15:00 UTC on October 1, with central convection becoming more symmetric.[14] An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft recorded 700 mb flight-level winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h) around the northeastern eyewall.[15] Later that day, Orlene intensified, reaching Category 2 hurricane.[16] Strengthening continued as Orlene estimated a well-defined eye with a diameter of 10\u201315\u00a0nmi (19\u201328\u00a0km), and at 06:00 UTC the next day, Orlene became a Category 3 hurricane.[17][18] Six hours later, Orlene peaked as a Category 4 major hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130\u00a0mph (215\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 949\u00a0mbar (28.02\u00a0inHg).[19][20] Southwestern wind shear began to increase, as the eye had become cloud-filled as a result, the hurricane weakened to Category 3 strength.[21] The center of the storm, embedded within an area of cloud top temperatures below 70\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C (158\u2013176\u00a0\u00b0F).[22] Orlene weakened to Category 2 strength at 03:00 UTC on October 3.[23] Orlene's cloud pattern became less organized, due to the influence of strong southwesterly shear associated with an upper-level trough near Baja California.[24] Orlene made landfall just north of the Nayarit and Sinaloa border's, weakening to a Category 1 strength by 13:45 UTC.[25] By 18:00 UTC, the storms moved inland and weakened, into a tropical storm.[26] Orlene rapidly weakened, becoming a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC that same day.[27] The system later dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental late on October 4.[28]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "The Government of Mexico issued a hurricane warning on September 30 for Islas Mar\u00edas, with tropical storm watches and warnings posted on the coast of San Blas and Manzanillo.[2] In the state of Sinaloa, emergency shelters were opened.[29] The ports of Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta were closed.[29] According to the Secretary of Tourism of Mazatlan, Rosario Torres Noriega, flights at the airport were suspended due to the approaching storm.[30] Classes were also suspended in Jalisco.[31] Ten municipalities in Jalisco were placed under a \"orange\" alert.[32] Red alerts were issued for Sinaloa, and Nayarit.[32] More than 300 operational officers and different dependencies were deployed.[33] The State Civil Protection (UEPC) of the Government of Colima were advised to take necessary precautions.[34] Orlene brought heavy rains that caused landslide in Durango-Mazatl\u00e1n Superhighway.[35] Orlene produced large swells, affecting areas from the west coast of Mexico.[36] In the municipality of Escuinapa, heavy winds brought down an electricity tower, causing the area to be left without power. Fallen poles and downed trees were reported throughout El Rosario.[37] Border crossings from the state of Sinaloa into the state of Nayarit were minimalized after Orlene made landfall.[38] Orlene affected families approximately 700 people.[39] 242 schools were impacted, receiving minor damage.[4] In Puerto Vallarta, the hurricane caused widespread flooding in the communities.[40] So far, no victims or significant damage have been reported, according to Nayarit's Secretary of Security, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez.[30] Heavy rains were reported across the Acaponeta.[41] Plan DN-III-E, a disaster relief and rescue plan, was activated in Sinaloa after the passage of Orlene.[42] 80 houses were affected in La Huerta.[43] The Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) were deployed its crews to repair the damage caused by the strong winds.[44] The CFE reported 49,092 customers lost electricity across Sinaloa and Nayarit, due to Orlene.[3] Overall, Orlene left at least MX$12 million (US$600,000) of damage in San Blas.[5]",

      "Hurricane Rafael": " Hurricane Rafael produced minor damage in the northeastern Caribbean Sea in mid-October\u00a02012. The seventeenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the 2012 hurricane season, Rafael originated from a tropical wave roughly 230\u00a0mi (370\u00a0km) south-southeast of Saint Croix on October\u00a012; because the system already contained tropical storm-force winds, it skipped tropical depression status. Though initially disorganized due to moderate wind shear, a subsequent decrease allowed for shower and thunderstorm activity to develop in earnest by October\u00a014. While moving north-northwestward the following morning, Rafael intensified into a Category\u00a01 hurricane. A cold front off the East Coast of the United States caused the system to turn northward and eventually northeastward by October\u00a016, at which time Rafael attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h). As the cyclone entered a more stable atmosphere and tracked across increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures, it began extratropical transition, a process the system completed by the following afternoon. However, Rafael's extratropical remnant persisted for another nine days, with the storm looping around a larger extratropical low over the north-central Atlantic, before turning southeastward and then eastward. Rafael's remnant later made landfall on Portugal on October\u00a026, before dissipating later that day. As a disorganized tropical cyclone in the northeastern Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. As much as a foot of rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. Lightning activity as a result of heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway. As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. Gusts over 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, but overall, damage was minimal.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The formation of Hurricane Rafael is attributed to a low-latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on October\u00a05. The wave remained disorganized until roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles, at which time a broad area of low pressure developed and convection began to consolidate around it. As a result, the disturbance was introduced into the National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s 48-hour Tropical Weather Outlook with a low chance of tropical development.[1] These chances were subsequently raised as further development occurred, with the system receiving a medium chance of development early on October\u00a010,[2] and a high chance of development as it approached the southern Leeward Islands late the following evening.[3] As the wave crossed into the eastern Caribbean Sea and slowed down, the previously broad and open surface low consolidated and became stacked with the mid-level center. The disturbance was already producing tropical storm-force winds,[4] and as a result, skipped tropical depression status to become Tropical Storm Rafael at 1800\u00a0UTC on October\u00a012. At this time, the cyclone was located roughly 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) south-southeast of St. Croix.[5] Despite being named, Rafael remained disorganized initially;[6] this was the result of the interaction between an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity.[7] Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast (CDO) was noted on satellite imagery.[8] Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600\u00a0UTC on October\u00a015, while positioned about 650\u00a0mi (1045\u00a0km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.[5] As Rafael moved northward, it continued to intensify rapidly, in spite of moderate wind shear. An eye became visible on microwave imagery during the morning hours of October\u00a016, during which time the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 969\u00a0mb (hPa; 28.61\u00a0inHg). By the afternoon hours of that same day, data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicated that Rafael was on the verge of a weakening trend, attributed to decreasing sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear. Though the system retained hurricane-force winds, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone on October\u00a017, a process it completed by 1800\u00a0UTC that same day, after interacting with a cold front; at the time of the transition, Rafael was positioned well southwest of Nova Scotia. For the next couple of days, Rafael's remnant accelerated northeastward across the north-central Atlantic Ocean, before proceeding to loop counterclockwise around a larger extratropical low for two days, to the southeast of Greenland, from October\u00a019 to 20. During this time, Rafael's extratropical remnant strengthened even further, with the storm's minimum central pressure bottoming out at 966 millibars (28.5\u00a0inHg) at 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a020. Afterward, the cyclone's remnant resumed its eastward motion, meandering towards the southeast for a few days, before turning eastward on October\u00a023, while situated over the Azores. Rafael's extratropical remnant gradually weakened over the next few days, as it moved towards Portugal. Rafael's remnant later made landfall on Portugal on October\u00a026, before dissipating by 1800\u00a0UTC that day.[5]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Caribbean islands[edit]": "Shortly after the development of Rafael, a tropical storm watch was issued for the island of Puerto Rico; tropical storm warnings were issued for surrounding locations, including the British and U.S. Virgin Islands. By the morning hours of October 13, the warnings were discontinued for Saint Lucia and Martinique, but issued for Culebra and Vieques. The warnings were discontinued for Guadeloupe and Saint Martin by the pre-dawn hours of the following morning as Rafael pulled away, and expired for the remaining northeastern Caribbean Islands several hours later.[5] In preparation for the system, the Virgin Islands Territorial Management Agency (VITEMA) activated several emergency operation centers across the region, and requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), who deployed  a team of workers to cover the aftermath of Rafael. The departments of public works and power authority placed emergency crews on standby, while all ports out of the U.S. Virgin Islands were open to outbound vessel traffic only; the Coast Guard advised mariners to prepare for impending severe weather.[9] As a tropical storm, Rafael hit Guadeloupe with large amounts of rain, causing significant damage to homes and especially crops. According to M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, up to 5.9 inches (150\u00a0mm) fell in 3 hours in the prefecture of Basse-Terre, and up to 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) in 48 hours between October\u00a013 and 14; an estimated 7.9 inches (200\u00a0mm) fell during that same timeframe in Grande-Terre.[10] Flooding and mudslides as a result of the heavy rain damaged 60 to 80% of the vegetable crops in Grande-Terre, and lightning as a result of strong storms sparked fires and led to power outages. Sustained winds of 24\u00a0mph (39\u00a0km/h) and gusts reaching 42\u00a0mph (68\u00a0km/h) occurred in Raizet; gusts reached 64\u00a0mph (103\u00a0km/h) in La D\u00e9sirade. A woman was killed in Matouba, part of Saint-Claude, after attempting to drive her car across a flooded roadway; she was swept away.[11] Heavy rains in St. Kitts, amounting to 11.87\u00a0in (301\u00a0mm) in a 30\u2011hour span,[12] caused significant flooding and mudslides, especially around Basseterre. Traffic across the area was paralyzed as roads became impassable, and most businesses were closed for the duration of the storm. Many residents lost power and water supply as well.[13] A few people attempted to drive through flooded roads and required rescue.[12] Numerous weather stations in the French islands of Saint Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my and Saint Martin recorded gusts of 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) and 67\u00a0mph (108\u00a0km/h), respectively. Although several boats were grounded, overall damage remained fairly minor in the French territories. Road 2 between Manati, Puerto Rico and Vega Baja, Puerto Rico was flooded; several houses were also flooded at Toa Alta High.[14]",
      "Bermuda[edit]": "As Rafael exited the northeastern Caribbean Sea, a tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda on October\u00a014. This watch was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm warning the following morning, but was dropped by early on October\u00a017 as the system passed northeast of the island.[5] In advance of the system, residents were urged to take their typical precautionary measures;[15] in addition, the main two airlines on Bermuda\u2014WestJet and United Airlines\u2014cancelled hundreds of flights on October\u00a016.[16] Officials warned of minor storm surge along low-lying coasts,[17] while the Bermuda Weather Service (BWS) warned of two to four inches of rainfall. Winds, while stronger than locals expected, did not cause significant damage.[18] The BWS noted that sustained winds of 34\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h), and gusts reaching 51\u00a0mph (82\u00a0km/h), occurred at the L.F. Wade International Airport as the storm made its closest approach;[19] these winds left about 600\u00a0houses without electricity according to the Bermuda Electric Light Company.[18] Rainfall was less than originally feared, peaking at 1.71 inches (43\u00a0mm).[19]",
      "Newfoundland[edit]": "Though tropical cyclone watches and warnings were not issued, city officials in St. John's recommended all residents in Newfoundland to prepare for Rafael.[20] Large swells and storm surge produced by the post-tropical cyclone caused extensive damage along the Avalon Peninsula.[21] According to locals, the waves were more intense than during Hurricane Igor, a cyclone which devastated the region during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.[22] Large sections of roads were washed out or covered in debris left behind by the waves. Near Trepassey, the local breakwater was destroyed in three sections, allowing waves to wash inland.[23] As a result, a 9.1\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) wide and 1.5\u00a0m (5\u00a0ft) deep gap in one of the main roads was left behind. In an area known as the Lower Coast, 50 people were cut off from the surrounding area. Overall damage in the area was estimated at C$1\u20132\u00a0million.[21] Rainfall associated with the storm was light, amounting to 6\u00a0mm (0.24\u00a0in) in Cape Race.[24]",

      "Typhoon Irma (1981)": " Typhoon Irma, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Anding, was a powerful typhoon that struck the Philippines in November 1981. The twenty-fifth named storm and fourteenth typhoon of the 1981 Pacific typhoon season, Irma originated from an active monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines. Following an increase in organization, the system was first classified on November\u00a018 and was subsequently upgraded into a tropical storm on the next day as it moved westward. After passing near Guam, Irma continued to deepen, and was estimated to have attained typhoon intensity early on November\u00a021. The intensification rate accelerated thereafter, and on the afternoon of November\u00a022, Irma reached its peak wind speed of 205\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph). After maintaining this intensity for 16\u00a0hours, Irma weakened considerably due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of the Philippines. On the morning of November\u00a024, Irma moved ashore northeast of Manila, with winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). The storm rapidly deteriorated overland, but was still believed to have been a typhoon when it emerged into the South China Sea. Irma then began to re-curve towards the northwest while weakening; the cyclone was estimated to have obtained extratropical characteristics on November\u00a026. Affecting an area already severely impacted by Typhoon Hazen, Irma brought significant damage and flooding to the Philippines, especially in the province of Camarines Norte. Additionally, a 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) tidal wave was noted in four towns in the Camarines Sur province, resulting in the deaths of 137\u00a0people. The nearby village of Benagaspasan was nearly demolished, where 47\u00a0fatalities occurred. In all, 595\u00a0were killed due to Irma. A total of 482,678 persons were directly affected by Irma. Irma destroyed or damaged 119,233\u00a0dwellings, which left nearly 40,000\u00a0homeless. A total of 24,137\u00a0families or 141,974\u00a0individuals left their homes, including 57,198 that sought emergency shelter. Overall, damage totaled to $63.3\u00a0million (1981\u00a0USD).[nb 1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Typhoon Irma originated from an active monsoon within the vicinity of Micronesia. The second of three storms to form within this region in mid-November\u00a01981, the cyclone was first noted on November\u00a010 as a \"zone of strong convection activity\". Although the zone was well-organized, there was initially little to no evidence of a low-level circulation. However, a weak circulation was detected on a few days later, and on November\u00a015, the system was situated to the east of Ponape as satellite imagery indicated that convection was developing. During the next three days, thunderstorm activity waxed and waned as the disturbance moved north and then west. During this time, the disturbance was located 1,100\u00a0km (685\u00a0mi) east of Typhoon Hazen. By November\u00a018, shower activity had improved in both coverage and organization. That afternoon, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the disturbance.[1] Within two hours, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began to track the system.[2][nb 2] On the morning of November\u00a019, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph), prompting the JTWC to classify the system as a tropical depression.[1] After passing north of Guam, Irma was upgraded into a tropical storm by both agencies.[4][nb 3] Around this time, the JTWC expected that Irma would pass south of a front and then turn southwest.[1] Tropical Storm Irma began to deepen more rapidly, and on November\u00a020, the JMA upgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm.[2] Thereafter, Irma turned west as a subtropical ridge built north and northwest of the storm, which protected Irma from feeling the effects of strong wind shear.[1] At 1800 UTC on November\u00a020, the JTWC upgraded Irma into a typhoon.[4] Later that evening, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 968\u00a0mbar (28.6\u00a0inHg).[1] Following the formation of a 74\u00a0km (46\u00a0mi) eye,[1] the JMA declared that Irma attained typhoon status at 0000\u00a0UTC on November\u00a021;[2] subsequently, the system passed south of a second cold front. By 0900\u00a0UTC that day, rapid deepening to pressures below 925\u00a0mbar (27.3\u00a0inHg) was anticipated by the JTWC.[1] At 1800 UTC\u00a0on November\u00a021, the JMA raised the intensity of the typhoon to 175\u00a0km/h (110\u00a0mph)[2] while the JTWC reported that Irma reached winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). Midday on November\u00a022, a Hurricane Hunter airplane reported a pressure of 905\u00a0mbar (25\u00a0inHg). Based on this the JTWC upgraded Irma into a super typhoon.[1] Meanwhile, data from both the JTWC and JMA suggested that Irma reached its peak intensity, with the former reporting winds of 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph) and the latter reporting winds of 200\u00a0km/h (125\u00a0mph).[4] On that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started to monitor the storm and assigned it with the local name Anding.[6][7] Irma maintained super typhoon intensity for 16\u00a0hours before gradually weakening due to the storm's close proximity to the mountainous terrain of the Philippines. After turning northwest towards a break within the subtropical ridge, Irma moved ashore around 0900\u00a0UTC on November\u00a024, roughly 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) northeast of Manila.[1] At the time of landfall, both agencies estimated winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph), equal to Category\u00a02 intensity on the SSHWS.[4] Although the JTWC downgraded Irma to a tropical storm that afternoon just before entering Lingayen Gulf and the South China Sea,[1] the JMA maintained Irma at typhoon intensity throughout the storm's passage of the Philippines.[2] Ten hours later, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated Irma and noted that Irma was poorly organized, with most of the convection sheared off to the north of the center. Influenced by a trough east of Asia, Irma began to re-curve into the Luzon Straits on November\u00a025.[1] Around this time, the JMA downgraded Irma into a severe tropical storm. Early on November\u00a026, the JMA reported that Irma had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.[2] About 24\u00a0hours later, Irma merged with a cold front in the Ryukyu Islands.[1] On the evening of November\u00a027, both PAGASA and the JMA ceased monitoring Irma.[2][7]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "A few days prior to Irma's passage, the Philippines archipelago was affected by Typhoon Hazen, which left 2,000\u00a0homeless.[8] As Irma neared landfall, radio and television authorities warned residents to take precautions. Relief agencies were placed on standby. Schools were closed.[9] Much of the Philippines, including the capital city of Manila, was placed on typhoon alert.[10] After striking the Philippines, the storm caused widespread damage[1] while becoming the strongest storm to affect the archipelago since 1970.[9] The hardest hit was the province of Camarines Norte along the eastern portion of the island of Luzon.[11] A 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) tidal wave swamped the towns of Garchitorena, Serona, Lagonoy and Caramoan in the Camarines Sur province, situated roughly 230\u00a0km (145\u00a0mi) southeast of Manila. Throughout the aforementioned four towns, 137\u00a0people were killed.[12] Virtually every house was demolished due to storm surge in Benagaspasan,[13] a small town with a population 1,000.[14] A total of 47\u00a0killed in the village. Thirty-seven were injured in Bengaspasan as well.[13] Fourteen survivors sought refuge in a health center 46\u00a0m (150\u00a0ft) from the shore.[15] In Caramoan, only one of 2,000\u00a0homes remained standing;[14] 38 persons were killed. Elsewhere, in Garchitorena, a town with 20,000\u00a0residents,[16] 117\u00a0people perished[17] and only the mayor's house was left standing.[16] The communities of Serona and Lagonoy also suffered heavy damage.[18] Across much of Luzon, Irma flattened houses and flooding streets, resulting in considerable damage. Irma brought down power lines, which led to blackouts along the suburbs of Manila.[19] One army officer died via electrocution while trying to fix the roof of his dwelling[19] in Makati.[20] Many other deaths occurred when they were crushed to death under collapsed houses or killed by flying debris.[20] For instance, two people died when their house on Mindoro Island collapsed and a farmer in Quezon died after being hit by a falling coconut.[19] Elsewhere on Midoro Island, 60 homes were destroyed. Offshore, eighteen fisherman were listed as missing.[20] Twenty-six of the casualties happened in Manila[11] while 12\u00a0others died in the rural town of Daet along the southern part of Luzon due to flooding and falling debris.[21] Due to the storm, iron sheets were littered across the slums of Manila.[20] Communication lines between Daet and Manila were disconnected; many villages between the two location were destroyed. In Lucena, two people were killed and many coconuts were tossed from trees.[22] In Bulacan, civil defense officials advised thousands of inhabitants on the banks of the Angat River to flee as water along the river threatened to overflow their banks. In the Rizal province, one agency reported that it dispatched several army trucks to fetch roughly 2,000\u00a0stranded 12- to 15-year-old boy scouts.[19] In a nearby park, the typhoon blew down houses, power poles, billboards and trees.[20] Even though the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay, both United States-run, sustained little damage, six C-130 transports had to be evacuated to the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa and ships, including the aircraft carrier Constellation.[23] Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos ordered the closure of all government offices in affected areas, which included the capital city of Manila. Additionally, many private offices sent their employees home.[19] A total of 482,678\u00a0individuals were directly affected by the storm.[17] According to press reports, 12,076\u00a0families in six provinces lost their homes.[19] Nearly 40,000\u00a0persons were rendered as homeless.[24] In all, Typhoon Irma destroyed or damaged 119,233\u00a0houses.[25] A total of 24,137\u00a0families or 141,974\u00a0persons left their homes,[20] 57,198 of which fled to evacuation centers because of flash flooding.[26] The aforementioned evacuation camps included schools, town halls, and churches.[27] Overall, damage totaled to $63.3\u00a0million,[7] including $41.8\u00a0million from infrastructure.[6][nb 4] Crop damage was minimal,[20] estimated at $10\u00a0million.[28] Furthermore, 595\u00a0people were killed because of Irma.[29] Seventy-two others were wounded.[25]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "Officials issued a tropical storm warning for Guam when Irma formed on November\u00a017. Winds of 56\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) were measured in addition to 81\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph) gusts.[1] However, no major damage was reported.[8] The decaying remnants of Irma then brought 105 to 150\u00a0mm (5 to 5\u00a0in) of rain and winds of up to 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) to Okinawa.[30][31]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "Following Irma, many survivors in Benagaspasan demanded for an emergency airlift of food, medicine, and clothing.[13] These were expected to be provided by air force authorities.[32] Proven\u00e7al governments asked the president to declare Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur provinces disaster areas.[33] Marcos also toured over the devastated area, noting that damage was less than initially feared.[14] On December\u00a01, President Marcos declared a state of emergency in 17\u00a0Philippines provinces. Following a meeting, Marcos ordered the release of $278,750 to help subsidize rice to farmers. Moreover, $250,000 was ordered to be released for other relief operations.[34]",

      "Hurricane Henri": " Hurricane Henri (/\u0252n\u02c8ri\u02d0/ ahn-REE[1]) was a minimal category 1 hurricane that impacted the Northeastern United States. The eighth named storm and third hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Henri developed from a well-defined low-pressure system north-northeast of Bermuda, becoming a tropical depression on August 16. Nearly a day later, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri. Henri continued to move south, and later southwest before strengthening steadily, reaching its initial peak intensity with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 994\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg) early on August\u00a019. Soon after, strong wind shear weakened Henri slightly. Eventually, on August 21, Henri strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane, before weakening back to a tropical storm and making landfall in Westerly, Rhode Island, on August 22, making it the second tropical cyclone to make landfall in the U.S. state of Rhode Island during the season, seven weeks after Elsa. It proceeded to move west-northwestward, weakening into a tropical depression while slowing down later that day. On August 23, Henri degenerated into a remnant low over New England, before dissipating the next day over the Atlantic. Despite its relatively weak intensity, the storm brought very heavy rainfall over the Northeastern United States and New England, causing widespread flooding in many areas, including cities such as New York and Boston. Power outages became extensive in the region, while wind damage was sparse in comparison. In the aftermath of Henri, many crews were put in place from around the United States to help with recovery efforts and rescues. The storm caused less damage overall than initially feared, due to a weaker landfall and faster weakening trend compared to what was previously forecast. Henri continued to drop large amounts of rain as it weakened over land, prolonging floods and power outages. Henri killed two people and caused an estimated $700 million (2021 USD) in damage.[2]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On August\u00a014, a small low pressure area formed over 200\u00a0mi (320\u00a0km) north-northeast of Bermuda, with disorganized convection, or thunderstorms. That same day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) mentioned the weather system as an area of potential tropical cyclogenesis, as the low drifted southward.[3] The thunderstorms became more organized on August\u00a015.[4] In the early hours of August\u00a016, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Eight, while it was located about 135\u00a0mi (217\u00a0km) east-northeast of Bermuda. Warm sea temperatures favorable for the system's development were counteracted by northerly wind shear. The nascent depression moved slowly southwestward, steered around a ridge off the coast of the Eastern United States.[5] Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Henri, after the storm's deep convection organized further near the center.[6] By August\u00a017, Henri moved westward, toward the Eastern United States. Its convection evolved into curved rainbands, and an eye feature was evident in the storm on Bermuda radar; however, it was still affected by wind shear at the time.[7] The shear and dry air caused the storm's structure to deteriorate on August\u00a019.[8] On August\u00a020, Henri turned towards the north, steering by an approaching trough over the Appalachians and a building ridge to the northeast of the storm.[9] On August 21, at 15:00\u00a0UTC, Henri became a Category 1 hurricane after reconnaissance aircraft found hurricane-force winds.[10] It would maintain hurricane intensity for another day, before weakening back to a high-end tropical storm at 11:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a022, as it approached southern New England.[11] The storm made landfall on August\u00a022, in Westerly, Rhode Island, around 16:15\u00a0UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).[12] The storm rapidly weakened into a tropical depression early the next day, before becoming post-tropical.[13][14] Henri's remnants persisted for another day before dissipating off the coast of Nova Scotia.[15][16]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Bermuda[edit]": "At 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, when Tropical Depression Eight was designated, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch as tropical storm conditions were possible.[17] When Henri started to move away from Bermuda, the Bermuda Weather Service discontinued the tropical storm watch for the territory.[18]",
      "United States[edit]": "Power outages were widespread through most of New England due to Henri's impacts.[31][24] At least 140,000 houses experienced outages across New Jersey to Maine.[32] Conditions rapidly deteriorated the morning Henri made landfall, causing flooding in numerous locations across the Northeastern United States.[27] By the morning of August 23, over 65,000 were still without power.[33] Henri had weakened more quickly over land than initially expected, lessening overall impacts.[34] Insured losses across the Northeast were estimated at $155\u00a0million by Karen Clark & Co.[35]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "New York[edit]": "Record-breaking rainfall of 1.94 inches (49\u00a0mm) fell in just one hour in Central Park,[36] the then-wettest hour on record for New York City. A concert which was to be held in Central Park was postponed that same night due to lightning and harsh weather.[24][37] On Roosevelt Island, the Four Freedoms State Park closed due to the inclement weather.[38] A Major League Baseball game between the New York Yankees and Minneapolis Twins was also postponed.[39] A Major League Soccer game between the New York Red Bulls and New York City FC was also postponed after a two and a half hour delay.[40] The hourly rainfall record was the wettest in 150 years, and Brooklyn drivers abandoned their cars after waist-deep flooding inundated their vehicles.[41] 4.45 inches (113\u00a0mm) in total fell during August 21, the highest total in a day for the city (since 2014[42]), while the 7.01-inch (178\u00a0mm) total was the highest since Irene in 2011.[32] Great Gull Island clocked in a 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) wind gust.[31][43] Tuxedo Park collected 5 inches (130\u00a0mm), Henricks collected 6 inches (150\u00a0mm), and Nyack allocated 3.6 inches (91\u00a0mm). Parts of Staten Island had slightly more than 4 inches (100\u00a0mm) of rainfall.[42] Power outages decreased greatly on August 23, with 71 outages in Ulster County and 9 in Dutchess County. 101 of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp's more than 300,000 customers were without power that day. In total, a few thousand people had lost power at several points during August 21 and 22. Officials reported no flooded roads in Dutchess, though there were some fallen trees. Ulster had no reported major floods.[44] Bronx River Parkway was closed for two days, where crews scraped off four inches (10 centimeters) of mud. Saw Mill River Parkway was closed for two days as well.[45] Henri's rainfall, along with New York's 3rd wettest July,[46] made 2021 the second-wettest summer ever in New York City; with 23.36 inches (593\u00a0mm) in total (on August 23). Nearly 2 months of rain fell in a day and a half in Central Park. The city's storm-sewer system, which can only handle about 3.8\u00a0billion U.S. gallons (14\u00a0billion liters) daily, had over 42\u00a0billion\u00a0US\u00a0gal (160\u00a0billion\u00a0L) fall into it from Henri from August 21\u201322. Videos taken in the subway system showed rain pouring down, however, these led to a few disruptions in service.[36]",
      "Rhode Island[edit]": "On the morning of August 22, over 58,000 people were without power in Rhode Island, with outages being particularly widespread in Washington County. Wind gusts reached over 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[24] Trees and power lines were downed from the storm.[31] Newport was spared from the worst of the storm. A 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) sailboat named Paws washed up to shore in the city, however, its owner was not found.[27] In Cranston, there were 11 inches of rainfall, causing flooding.[47] Nearly 41,000 people were still without power the morning of August 23.[48] 75 percent of the town of South Kingstown lost power on August 22. The state was to have been hit an estimated 15 to 20 percent harder in power outages than Massachusetts and Connecticut.[30]",
      "New Jersey[edit]": "In New Jersey, more than 8 inches (200\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the town of Cranbury. Up to 9 inches (230\u00a0mm) of rain fell in the state, bringing heavy flooding in multiple areas, such as Jamesburg, where heavy rain caused flooding on roads.[24] Numerous roads were closed in Middlesex, with vehicles submerged in floodwaters. Homes were flooded with up to 3 feet (0.91 meters) of water in Cranbury, and some residences and businesses were flooded in Milltown.[31] During the early afternoon of August 22, over 4,500 were reported without power in the state.[26] Some places were flooded with up 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m) of water, and left behind 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) of mud.[49] Henri dropped 7.84 inches (199\u00a0mm) of rain in Ringwood, 6.94 inches (176\u00a0mm) in Harrison, and 5.65 inches (144\u00a0mm) in Ship Bottom.[42] Phil Murphy said that \"part of the state got crushed\". Houses in Rossmoor were swamped with floodwater, some up to 2 feet (61\u00a0cm) high.[49] Spotswood had seen extensive structural damage, including parts that were \"completely engulfed in water\". More than half of Helmetta's 73 houses suffered notable flooding damage.[50] Hoboken and Jersey City both saw large amounts of flooding. The former saw 2.43 inches (62\u00a0mm) fall in 14 hours, with a total of 4.07 inches (103\u00a0mm). The rainfall was the most recorded in a single storm since 2016. The latter experienced city-wide flooding, with a particularly major incident near Bayside Park. There, sustained rainfall caused a 50-inch (1.27\u00a0m) sewer line to collapse. Many roads around the area were closed, though only one was closed for the entire weekend. A sink hole opened in Merseles Street.[51] Over six point five inches (170\u00a0mm) of rain fell in Ship Bottom, where even more flooding was experienced. Areas north of Brant Beach in Long Beach Township, to Barnegat Light, received 4 to 7 inches (100 to 180\u00a0mm) of rain, compared to the average of 2 to 4 inches (51 to 102\u00a0mm). Harvey Cedars' police chief Robert Burnaford said the borough had \"dodged a bullet\".[52]",
      "Connecticut[edit]": "Saturated ground from the remnants of Fred just a few days prior to Henri's arrival worsened the flooding situation in the state as the storm passed over. Governor Ned Lamont stated the rain was \"coming down in buckets\". 7,600 people were without power on the morning of August 22.[24] Trees and wires were reported to be downed.[31] Four nursing homes were evacuated when Henri made landfall. Over 248 nursing homes were affected in the towns of Old Saybrook, Mystic, Guilford, and West Haven.[53] Soundview Beach's water overflowed, causing \"Hubcap\"-deep waters in the area.[27] Approximately 9,000 of Eversource Energy's customers had no power. The town of Canterbury reported a loss of power for 95% of their businesses and residences.[54] A road in Manchester collapsed due to rainfall saturation.[55] Rainfall totals for the state were much less than initially forecasted. New London received the most, where 3.7 inches (94\u00a0mm) fell. 1.56 inches (40\u00a0mm) fell in Danbury, 1.54 inches (39\u00a0mm) in Shelton, 1.17 inches (30\u00a0mm) in Norwalk, 1.08 inches (27\u00a0mm) in Westport, and exactly 1 inch (25.4\u00a0mm) in Greenwich.[42] In Pawcatuck, a tree fell onto a home's roof, damaging the roof and toppling the head of a chimney.[56] 30 cars in a parking lot were trapped due to flooding.[57] Hartford's donation drive for Back-To-School efforts were hindered, where as a delivery of 500 book-bags was delayed. 100 of these were ruined due to water damage.[58] Botticello Farm in Manchester had suffered crop damage to their tobacco plants, as well as their corn. Overall, Henri added to the struggle of farming in 2021's summer due to excessive rainfall.[59] The library in New Canaan had suffered minimal damage.[60]",
      "Massachusetts[edit]": "Wind gusts ranging from 40 to 60 miles per hour (64 to 97\u00a0km/h) were recorded.[31] In Oxford, a large tree was uprooted and fell onto and damaged a house. The people residing inside the house survived. The tree fell in part due to saturated grounds from the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred, several days earlier. A 300-year old home was damaged by a falling tree. Some other trees fell on cars and blocked roadways.[61] Henri also caused power outages in the state, with Worcester County reporting the most outages.[62] Due to the storm, the game between the Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers had to be postponed.[63] Three EF0 tornadoes caused minor damage in Marlborough, Stow, and Bolton.[62][64] One touched down west of Interstate 495 near the John J. Carroll Water Treatment Plant, and entered into a business park.[65] Another tornado, in Bolton, downed trees, with one of them falling on power lines. A third one touched down near the Stow Police Department, downing a large tree. A waterspout formed over a lake in Ashburnham.[62]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "Two family members drowned near a pier in Oak Island, North Carolina after being caught in strong rip currents produced as a result of Henri.[66] In Pennsylvania, 6.03 inches (153\u00a0mm) fell in Albrightsville, 5.80 inches (147\u00a0mm) in Gouldsboro, 5.68 inches (144\u00a0mm) in Mount Pocono, 5.54 inches (141\u00a0mm) in Jim Thorpe, 4.86 inches (123\u00a0mm) in Stroudsburg, and 4.29 inches (109\u00a0mm) in Thornhurst. These totals caused flooding in local areas.[67] Major flooding was seen in Dunmore, where a sewer was overflowed, causing a temporary geyser. Nearby basements and parking lots were damaged.[68] Flooding forced a portion of Interstate 80 in Monroe County to close.[69] Parx Racing was forced to reschedule the Grade III Parx Dash Stakes which was originally scheduled for August 24, 2021 and moved to the following week, due to the state of the turf track.[70] The Kalahari resort in the Poconos was forced to temporarily shut down due to flooding.[71] States as far as Maine saw deluges, due to Henri's large size and slow movement.[72] There were hundreds of power outages in the state; however, outage numbers were much lower in Vermont and in New Hampshire.[73] In New Hampshire, portions of the White Mountain National Forest briefly closed due to the hurricane.[74]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "Several thousands of crews were put on stand by to respond to what was expected to be widespread power outages.[24][30] Connecticut was assisted by crews coming from states as far away as Texas.[53] People were rescued in New Jersey after very high flooding, including 86 in Newark, 16 of whom were children.[26][56][73][32] Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee surveyed damage done by the storm in the southern region on August 22.[75] Ned Lamont and Phil Murphy were set to tour damage on August 23.[76][77] In South Kingstown and surrounding areas, 500 line crews and an additional 200+ street crews, were deployed to help restore power, as well as a state damage assessment team.[30] Monroe Township opened a shelter on August 23 to help rescue those who lost their homes due to flooding, or were suffering from power outages.[78] On August 23, Lamont expressed confidence that nearly 90 percent of the state's 26,000 outages, would be recovered by 6 p.m. that day. These comments contrasted his statements from Isaias the previous year, which knocked out power to 750,000 houses, some for a week. The governor's new regulatory procedure that was in put into place after Isaias was proven to work well.[79] The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management helped clean up damage from the storm.[80] Daniel McKee commended the work of the utility National Grid, praising the efforts to help restore power in Rhode Island. Power was expected to be recovered to all by August 25.[49] American Red Cross helped support recovery efforts in Monroe Township.[81] Sewage was a concern for those in the community of Rossmoor, due to an overflowing of the system. Homes had to be abandoned due to water damage. Firefighters in Manchester, Connecticut helped evacuate 18 homes and made several rescues. President Biden declared disasters in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont and Connecticut.[72] Over 200 residents of Helmetta fled to higher ground, and took refuge in hotels due to flooding.[73] Pennsylvania deployed 16 members of its federal disaster response team to Connecticut.[82] New York State's Attorney General, Letitia James, warned of price gouging of essential items, as Henri passed. On August 22, the Federal Government declared disasters for 26 New York counties.[83]",

      "1876 San Felipe hurricane": " The San Felipe Hurricane was the second tropical cyclone of the 1876 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm was first observed east of the Leeward Islands on September 12, later intensifying to a category 3 hurricane while approaching Puerto Rico. In the upcoming days, the storm would make landfall on Hispaniola and Cuba, while also at hurricane intensity. Weakening to a tropical storm, it crossed the island until emerging over central Cuba, and passing just east of Florida. The storm re-intensified into a hurricane and struck near Wilmington, North Carolina as a minimal hurricane. Continuing inland, the San Felipe Hurricane gradually weakened over the United States, reaching near Cape Cod before dissipation on September 19.[1] The San Felipe Hurricane was the only tropical cyclone in the season to result in fatalities, according to records of the season.[citation needed]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A hurricane was first observed east of the Leeward Islands on September 12, hitting the islands that night. It first passed through Antigua, St. Kitts, and the Virgin Islands.  It strengthened on the next day to become a Category 3 hurricane, and hit Puerto Rico at that intensity on September 13; it entered by Yabucoa and Humacao at about seven in the morning and left the island through Mayag\u00fcez at 1:30 local time in the afternoon.[2] The minimum pressure that was measured in San Juan was about 29.20 inches of mercury (989\u00a0hPa) in the morning on September 14, with winds up to about 60\u00a0mph and rain at around 4.71 inches (120\u00a0mm).[2] The hurricane maintained this intensity and made landfall on the eastern side of Puerto Rico. Shortly after landfall, the hurricane rapidly weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, then to a Category 1 hurricane after reemerging in the Atlantic. Again maintaining strength, the hurricane made landfall on the eastern tip of Dominican Republic with winds of 80\u00a0mph.",
      "Impact[edit]": "The scientist and scholar Benito Vi\u00f1es went to Puerto Rico from Cuba to conduct a study to calculate the damages of the hurricane. It was the first hurricane in which a rain gauge was used.[clarification needed][2] San Felipe affected Puerto Rico for ten hours, killing nineteen people.[3]  Although there were 19 deaths reported, historians suspected the Spanish Government withheld the actual damage and death toll data for Puerto Rico.[4] At least two drownings occurred in Onslow County, North Carolina.[5] Flooding, damage to buildings, and uprooted trees were reported from Wilmington. A bridge across Market Street there was washed away.[6]\nThe storm was called the \"San Felipe Hurricane\" because it struck on September 13, the feast day of Saint Philip. Exactly 52\u00a0years later, Puerto Rico was struck by Hurricane San Felipe Segundo.",

      "Hurricane Tanya": "Hurricane Tanya was the first named storm to start with a \"T\" in the Atlantic since naming began in 1950, and the final storm of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. The twenty-first tropical cyclone, nineteenth named storm, and eleventh hurricane of the season, Tanya developed from a tropical wave while well north of the Lesser Antilles on October 26. The system headed northeastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Tanya on October 27. Tanya meandered around the central Atlantic, and further intensified into a hurricane on October 29. Thereafter, Tanya tracked northeastward before curving to the east-northeast. After switching to an eastward direction, Tanya weakened to a tropical storm on November 1. Later that day, Tanya passed through the Azores as it was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Throughout the Azores, the extratropical remnants of Tanya produced high winds. As a result, extensive property damage occurred, which included destroyed or damaged houses, and sunken boats; there were also reports of significant damage to agriculture. However, an exact damage toll figure in unknown. In addition, there was one fatality and several injuries.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Hurricane Tanya were from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa in the middle of October. The wave closely followed the path of Tropical Storm Sebastien and was unable to develop in the tropical Atlantic as it moved westward. The system did not begin to become organized until October\u00a025 while south-southeast of Bermuda. However, the Dvorak technique was still unable to classify the system until October\u00a026 as the low-cloud swirl became better organized while moving northward in the central Atlantic. That evening, a closed circulation had formed, and it was classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-One by the National Hurricane Center. On the morning of October\u00a027, it strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the 19th as well as the final named storm of the season.[1] Operationally, it was not declared a tropical cyclone until that point, when it was immediately declared Tropical Storm Tanya.[2] Immediately after becoming a tropical storm, the movement of Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October\u00a028.[3] The upper-level low also influenced Tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics, including a comma-shaped cloud band and maximum winds far from the center of the storm at the time.[1] Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C).[3] That afternoon, it gained full tropical characteristics, as an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast.[4] The eye became clearly defined, although it was small in size. Early on October 29, Tropical Storm Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane, the eleventh of the 1995\u00a0season, as it turned northward in response to the nearby low.[5] Later on October\u00a029, while slowly tracking north, Tanya leveled off as a low-end Category 1 hurricane. By the next morning, a cold front to the west forced Tanya to accelerate in a more easterly track .[6] It remained fairly well organized with a distinct eye as it became wedged in a narrow zone of warm air between the cold front to the west and the upper-level low to the northeast.[1] Despite slightly cooler water, Tanya strengthened a bit more that afternoon, reaching its peak intensity of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) with a barometric pressure of 972\u00a0mbar (28.7\u00a0inHg) as the forward speed increased.[7] That intensity was maintained until late on October\u00a031, when Tanya began to weaken as it traveled over cooler waters and the eye became obscured.[8] Early on November\u00a01, Tanya began to lose tropical characteristics while still a hurricane. Hurricane Tanya was also heading rapidly northeast towards the Azores at the time.[9] Tanya was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on November\u00a01. Despite weakening, the wind field of Tanya became larger.[10] That evening, Tanya was declared fully extratropical as it passed the Azores.[11] The remnant cyclone turned north, before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone early on November 3.[1]",
      "Impact, naming and records[edit]": "Hurricane Tanya was not considered a threat to land, as it did not move through the Azores while a tropical cyclone.[12] The Azores were hit very hard by the storm, which had just been declared extratropical when it hit the region.[1] Damage was particularly severe on the islands of Faial, Pico, Terceira and S\u00e3o Jorge. Extensive property damage was reported, including many capsized boats and several damaged or destroyed homes. Significant agricultural damage also occurred there. Many trees and power lines were knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported in the Azores were around 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands.[13] One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.[13] There were many reports of tropical storm-force winds from ships in the north Atlantic. One ship, with the call sign GBSA, encountered Tanya's winds twice and reported the strongest winds from any ship, 71\u00a0mph (112\u00a0km/h).[1] Hurricane Tanya was the first tropical cyclone to be designated a name starting with the letter \"T\" since naming of Atlantic tropical cyclones began in 1950.[14] There have been six subsequent T-named Atlantic tropical storms: Tammy in 2005 and 2023, Tomas in 2010, Tony in 2012, Teddy in 2020, and Teresa in 2021.[14][15]",

      "Independence Day Derecho of 1977": "The Independence Day Derecho of 1977 was a derecho, or long-lived windstorm associated with a fast-moving band of thunderstorms, that swept across the Great Lakes region of the U.S. on July 4, 1977. It lasted around 15\u00bd\u00a0hours. The derecho formed in western Minnesota around 10 a.m. CDT on July 4 and became more intense around noon in the central part of the state. The derecho produced winds of 80\u2013100\u00a0mph (130\u2013160\u00a0km/h) in northern Wisconsin, felling thousands of trees.[1]",
      "Wisconsin[edit]": "As the storm raced through Burnett, Washburn, Sawyer, Price, and Oneida counties, it caused a band of damage 10\u201320 miles (16\u201332\u00a0km) wide. Nearly 850,000 acres (3,400\u00a0km2) of forest were badly damaged or destroyed. The derecho caused $24M in property damage. One person was killed and 35 were injured. Here is a summary of damage by county:",
      "Michigan[edit]": "The derecho was not nearly as strong in Michigan as it was in Wisconsin. Many trees blew over and caused damage to homes and buildings as it moved into Manistee and Ludington. The storm spawned tornadoes as it moved into central Lower Michigan and two people were injured\u2014one from an overturned mobile home and another from an overturned camper. The derecho moved through Lower Michigan throughout the afternoon and evening before dissipating in northern Ohio around 1:30\u00a0a.m. EDT on July 5. A total of one\u00a0million acres (4,000\u00a0km2) of forest were damaged or destroyed, and the storm caused a total of $30M damage (1977\u00a0dollars).",
      "Bow Echo discovered[edit]": "After the storm, Dr. T. Theodore Fujita became aware of the extreme wind damage over northern Wisconsin and decided to conduct an investigation. He noticed that there were three areas of extreme damage from northeastern Minnesota to extreme northwestern Wisconsin, and then two more areas of forest blowdowns extending from Hayward to Rhinelander. He then went back and looked at the radar echos, and he noticed that they evolved into a bow signature. It was during this investigation that Dr Fujita discovered the bow or spearhead radar echo.",

      "Tropical Storm Kiko (2007)": "Tropical Storm Kiko was a strong tropical storm that capsized a boat off the western coast of Mexico, killing at least 15\u00a0people. The 15th and final tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the coast of Africa on September 26 and traversed the Atlantic. The wave crossed over Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on October\u00a08, where it spawned Tropical Depression 15-E on October\u00a015. The depression drifted to the south over the next day before briefly being declared Tropical Storm Kiko. It subsequently weakened into a tropical depression, but later reattained tropical storm intensity. By October\u00a018, Kiko was forecast to make landfall along the western Mexican coastline as a moderate tropical storm. However, the cyclone turned to the west and reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a020. The tropical storm slowly weakened to a remnant low-pressure area by October\u00a024 and completely dissipated on October\u00a027 without making landfall.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa on September\u00a026, quickly spawning an area of low pressure. Upon the formation of the low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September\u00a028. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October\u00a08. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275 miles (443 kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October\u00a013, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear.[1] The low developed enough convection late on October\u00a014 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435\u00a0mi (700\u00a0km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.[2] The depression was embedded within a broad, low-level cyclone with weak steering currents that caused Fifteen-E to drift southward for the next 30\u00a0hours.[1] On October\u00a016, strong easterly wind shear exposed the center of the depression from shower and thunderstorm activity. However, a curving convective band developed around the system, and satellites detected winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h). This prompted the National Hurricane Center to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Kiko as it drifted about 430\u00a0mi (690\u00a0km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.[3] The intensification was short-lived, and Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression six hours later when the center separated from diminishing convection.[4] On October\u00a017, the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm when the low became associated with deep convection.[5] The center remained poorly defined, and winds of tropical storm-force blew only in Kiko's southwest quadrant. Over the next few days, Kiko moved slowly towards the east-northeast as a minimal tropical storm and was forecast to either brush land or to make landfall along the Mexican coast on October\u00a019 or October\u00a020.[6] However, early on October\u00a019, Kiko turned to the northwest when a high-pressure ridge developed over Mexico.[1] Forecasters predicted that the storm would become a strong Category 1 hurricane as it turned away from Mexico and headed to sea.[7] As the ridge pushed the storm away from the coast, weaker wind shear and warm sea-surface temperatures allowed Kiko to gradually intensify. The storm reached its peak intensity of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) 991\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.28\u00a0inHg) late on October 20 while located around 175\u00a0mi (282\u00a0km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As it moved away from the coast, an eye began to form.[1][8] Shortly thereafter, shear increased and began to separate the low from the deep convection.[9] By the afternoon of October\u00a021, the storm was poorly organized and the center was partially exposed. At this time, the weakening system had winds sustained at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h).[10] Early on October\u00a022, a brief burst in showers and thunderstorms allowed the storm to maintain its intensity.[11] That evening, Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression as strong wind shear removed convection from the storm's center and exposed the low.[12] As the depression moved over a dryer and more hostile area, two inhibiting factors for development of tropical cyclones, it slowly weakened.[1] It lost almost all convection and degenerated to a remnant low-pressure area on October\u00a023, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory that night.[13] The remnant low moved west before dissipating on October\u00a027 over open waters.[1]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "On October\u00a018, a tropical storm warning was issued along the Mexican coastline from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero to Manzanillo, Colima, and a tropical storm watch extended northward to La Fortuna, Mexico, as Kiko was forecast to make landfall in that region on October\u00a021. Above-normal tides and dangerous waves were expected along the coast.[14] Rainfall totals of 4 to 7\u00a0in (100 to 180\u00a0mm) were possible over southwestern Mexico with isolated totals reaching 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm). As a precaution, port captains shut down shipping and advised residents to avoid low-lying areas that might flood.[1][15] Civil Defense advised these residents to move to temporary shelters and tourists were told to stay indoors.[16] Emergency procedures were on standby in case conditions became more threatening.[17] As the storm neared land, a ridge over Mexico prevented Kiko from coming ashore, resulting in far less damage than forecast.[1] As Kiko traveled parallel to the coast, heavy rain affected the region for two days.[18] In Kiko's rough seas off the coast of Mexico, a ship capsized with twenty-five\u00a0passengers and crew.[19] Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts, forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt. Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco Ixhuat\u00e1n and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship.[20] Only two\u00a0people survived; fifteen\u00a0bodies were recovered, and nine\u00a0passengers were never found.[19]",

      "Tropical Storm Abby (1964)": " Tropical Storm Abby was an exceptionally small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression out of a trough south of Louisiana on August\u00a05, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August\u00a07 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system and it became a tropical storm just 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg) at the storm's center. Around 18:00\u00a0UTC (1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August\u00a08 southwest of San Antonio, Texas. Prior to Abby's landfall in Texas, gale warnings were issued for the coast and residents on Matagorda Island were evacuated. Overall, the storm's impacts were limited due to its small size. Only two structures sustained damage in Matagorda, one being destroyed by a possible tornado, and the remaining effects resulted from flooding in Jackson and Victoria Counties. Total damage from the storm was estimated at $750,000 with the majority stemming from crops.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On August\u00a05, 1964, a weak trough emerged from Florida over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.[1] According to the Atlantic hurricane database (referred to as HURDAT), the system developed into a tropical depression by 18:00\u00a0UTC (1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT) that day, with its center located roughly 160\u00a0mi (255\u00a0km) south-southeast of the Mississippi River Delta.[2] Moving generally west, the system exhibited no signs of further development as it neared the Texas coastline. However, on August\u00a07, radar images from Brownsville, Galveston, Lake Charles, and Victoria showed an abrupt increase in organization. During the afternoon hours, banding features consolidated around a developing eye and weather reconnaissance planes were dispatched to the system.[1] Forecasters initially mistook the eye as a hook echo-type feature at the end of a squall line.[3] It is estimated that the depression became a tropical storm by 12:00\u00a0UTC (7:00\u00a0a.m. CDT), roughly 60\u00a0mi (95\u00a0km) southeast of Galveston, Texas.[2] Operationally, the system was not even monitored as a depression this time, with the classification and naming of Tropical Storm Abby occurring at 16:00\u00a0UTC (11:00\u00a0a.m. CDT) on August\u00a07.[4] Abby was an unusually small storm, with its entire circulation being far less than 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] Around 16:00\u00a0UTC (11:00\u00a0a.m. CDT) on August\u00a07,[4] reconnaissance measured a central barometric pressure of 1000 mbar (hPa; 29.53\u00a0inHg) within Abby, the lowest in relation to the system. They also reported peak winds of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) in squalls, which would rank as a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. These winds were seen to be an overestimate by forecasters and discarded, however. The system attained its maximum winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) by 18:00\u00a0UTC (1:00\u00a0p.m. CDT) and subsequently made landfall just northeast of Matagorda, Texas at 22:00\u00a0UTC (5:00\u00a0p.m. CDT).[1][2] Irvin Velbrecht, a forecaster at the Weather Bureau (now known as the National Weather Service) in Galveston, described the storm as a \"perfectly miniature hurricane.\"[5] Despite moving onshore, Abby's core continued to organize and it developed a closed eyewall roughly three hours later.[6] Thereafter the storm began to gradually weaken, passing over Edna around 02:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a08 (9:00\u00a0p.m. CDT on August\u00a07).[7] Weakening to a depression hours later, Abby ultimately degenerated into an area of showers and dissipated southwest of San Antonio by 12:00\u00a0UTC (7:00\u00a0a.m. CDT).[1][2]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Owing to the abrupt nature of Abby's development on August\u00a07, residents had little time to prepare for the storm.[8] According to Irvin Velbrecht, \"in the absence of aircraft reconnaissance and radar information, two reasonably new tools in storm detection, Abby could well have formed and approached the shore before knowledge of a tropical storm was gained.\"[5][9] Gale warnings were raised from Galveston to San Antonio immediately following the storm's formation and were kept in place through the morning of August\u00a08.[10] Evacuation orders were issued for Matagorda Island and most complied, with some deciding to remain at their homes.[8] Personnel at Matagorda Island Air Force Base were evacuated to Victoria. Red Cross facilities were readied and public shelters were opened in the area.[11] At the mouth of the Colorado River, seagoing vessels were tied down with extra rope.[12] Within the Weather Bureau, members of the Galveston office were the first to notice the system and relayed to the other offices in the area to attune their radars to follow the system.[6] Abby's small size resulted in its effects being limited to areas within the immediate track. Sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (70\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) were measured by the Army Corps of Engineers in Matagorda.[1] Near the town, a possible tornado unroofed a barn and tossed the structure 225\u00a0ft (69\u00a0m); this building previously had withstood the effects of Hurricane Carla in 1961.[8] Winds estimated at 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) tore part of the roof off a fishing warehouse in Matagorda itself.[12] Along the coast, tides ranged from 2 to 4\u00a0ft (0.61 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal from Matagorda to Freeport.[1] Four men and five dogs required rescue after their vessel became stranded on the Colorado River.[12] Heavy rains accompanied the system across Texas.[1] Most areas along the immediate track received at least 3 to 5\u00a0in (76 to 127\u00a0mm) of rain, with a peak value of 6.14\u00a0in (156\u00a0mm) recorded at the Victoria International Airport.[13] The hardest hit areas were in Jackson and Victoria counties where the heaviest rains fell. In these areas, flooding and strong winds damaged the cotton and rice crops;[7] however, effects of the rice crop were more limited due to losses from earlier storms as well as ongoing harvesting.[12] Some flooding also took place across the Atascosa River watershed, but no damage resulted. Overall, property damage was estimated at $150,000 while agricultural losses reached $600,000.[7]",

      "Typhoon Kate": "Typhoon Kate, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Titang,[1] was the second of two super typhoons to strike the Philippines within a week in October 1970, the first being Super Typhoon Joan. As a result, Kate produced heavy damage and over 631 casualties. At the time, Kate was one of the deadliest typhoons to strike the Philippines.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Super Typhoon Kate was first identified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on October\u00a07, 1970, and by the Japan Meteorological Agency on October\u00a09, 1970 as a tropical disturbance near the Marshall Islands. The system tracked in a general westward direction and relocated itself further south during this period in response to Typhoon Joan wake to the northwest. By October\u00a013, convection sharply increased as the system entered a region of strong diffluence. The following day, the disturbance featured a marked increase in organization as thunderstorms continued to consolidate around the center of circulation. During the afternoon of October\u00a015, reconnaissance aircraft reached the storm and reported that it was already nearing typhoon status. Sustained winds were measured at 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph) along with a barometric pressure of 985\u00a0mbar (hPa; 29.12\u00a0inHg).[2] At this time the storm was classified as Tropical Storm Kate, the 18th named storm of the 1970 season.[3] Additionally, the storm had begun developing an eyewall, an indication that the system was likely to intensify further. Over the following three days, the storm continued its westward track while gaining strength.[2] Throughout the day on October\u00a016, Kate underwent a period of rapid intensification. During this time, sustained winds increased from 140 to 215\u00a0km/h (87 to 134\u00a0mph), ranking Kate as a Category\u00a04 typhoon on the modern day Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.[4] Early on October\u00a017, reconnaissance planes flown into the typhoon measured the eye to be 18.5\u00a0km (11.5\u00a0mi) in diameter. Although winds were still increasing, the lowest pressure recorded in relation to Kate was measured at this time at 940\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.7\u00a0inHg).[5] As the typhoon neared the southeastern Philippine island of Mindanao on October\u00a018, it further intensified. Just before making landfall roughly 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) south of Davao City in the Davao Region, Kate attained its peak winds of 240\u00a0km/h (150\u00a0mph), classifying it as a super typhoon according to the JTWC.[4] As the storm moved over land, the eye abruptly shrank to 7.4\u00a0km (4.6\u00a0mi) in diameter but this feature dissipated hours later.[5] Due to the interaction with the mountainous terrain of the Philippines, Kate quickly weakened as it moved northwestward across the archipelago. By October\u00a019, the system had weakened to a tropical storm, less than 24\u00a0hours after attaining its peak winds.[4] Despite the notable weakening, the structure of the storm remained relatively intact as it moved over the Sulu Sea.[2] Throughout the day, the system briefly sped up before rapidly slowing near the South China Sea.[4] On October\u00a020, decreased interaction with land allowed Kate to re-attain typhoon status just before passing over Busuanga Island.[2] Continuing its northwest track, the typhoon slowly intensified and redeveloped a 37\u00a0mi (23\u00a0mi) wide eye. Late on October\u00a021, the JTWC assessed the storm to have re-attained Category\u00a04 intensity;[5] however, post-storm analysis indicated that sustained winds did not exceed 195\u00a0km/h (121\u00a0mph).[4] The following day, a ridge to the north of Kate prevented the system from tracking further north and prompted a west-southwestward track.[6] Gradual weakening took place over the following several days as Kate slowly neared the Indochina coastline. By October\u00a024, winds had decreased below 155\u00a0km/h (96\u00a0mph) and the eye became asymmetrical and partially open in the northeast quadrant.[4][7] On October\u00a025, the typhoon further weakened to a tropical storm just off the coast of Vietnam. Later that day, the system made its final landfall near Da Nang, Vietnam with winds of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph).[4][6] Rapid weakening ensued as Kate moved over the high terrain of southeast Asia, with the storm degrading to a tropical depression within six\u00a0hours of moving inland.[4] The system dissipated within the next 24\u00a0hours as it moved over the plateau region of Cambodia.[6]\nBoth JTWC and JMA released their final advisories as Kate dissipated over Vietnam.",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "In southern Mindanao, over 5,000 houses and other such structures were damaged or destroyed by storm surge, heavy rains and strong winds produced by Typhoon Kate. Damage from the storm was estimated at $50\u00a0million, making it one of the costliest typhoons on record at the time. A total of 631 people were confirmed to have been killed by the storm and 284 others were listed as missing, ranking Kate as one of the deadliest typhoons to strike the Philippines at the time.[2] An American newspaper, The Lewiston Daily Sun (now known as the Sun Journal) incorrectly dubbed Kate as the deadliest typhoon to ever hit the Philippines; however, typhoons Amy and Trix in the early 1950s had higher death tolls compared to Kate (991 and 995 respectively), while the 1881 Haiphong typhoon was believed to have killed 20,000 people in the Philippines. The newspaper also erroneously mentioned that the previous deadliest typhoon was a storm in the 1960s which killed 200 people in Manila \u2013 possibly referring to either Tropical Storm Lucille in 1960 or Typhoon Winnie in 1964.[8] The large loss of life from the typhoon is thought to be related to the lack of tropical cyclone experience for residents in southern Mindanao.[2] It was only 42 years later that another major typhoon, Typhoon Bopha, made landfall in southeastern Mindanao. Initial reports from the Red Cross indicated that at least 150 homes were destroyed within hours of Kate's landfall. Telecommunication was lost to much of the region as power lines were felled by high winds.[9] Within a day of the storm's passage, the death toll had reached 13 with 29 others missing and was expected to increase.[10]",
      "Vietnam[edit]": "Due to the threat of the typhoon, United States military officials prompted the evacuation of a military hospital near Da Nang and the relocation of aircraft. The level of fighting during Kate's passage was regarded as one of the lowest during the Vietnam War as most tactical bombing missions were canceled. During the 24\u00a0hours in which the storm affected Vietnam, the United States launched 46\u00a0air bombings, the fewest in over two years.[11] Although damage estimates and reports of deaths are scarce out of Vietnam, floodwaters, considered the worst since 1964, affected an area nearly 140 square miles (360\u00a0km2) south of Da Nang. Roughly 900 people were evacuated the first day after Kate by Marine Aircraft Group 16, and over 9,000 South Vietnamese were rescued by the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, in Vietnam to fight the Vietnam War.[12]",

      "Cyclone Berguitta": " Intense Tropical Cyclone Berguitta was a strong tropical cyclone that caused flooding in Mauritius and R\u00e9union in January 2018. The third tropical system and first intense tropical cyclone of the 2017\u201318 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Berguitta originated from an area of scattered thunderstorms southwest of the Chagos Archipelago on 10\u00a0January. It slowly organised as it moved southwards, and became a tropical storm as it turned west on 13\u00a0January. Berguitta then rapidly intensified to achieve its peak intensity on 15\u00a0January while stalling north of Rodrigues. At the time, the cyclone possessed 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), 1-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph), and a minimum central pressure of 960\u00a0hPa (28.35\u00a0inHg). Berguitta weakened as it moved slowly west-southwestwards on 16\u00a0January, and the cyclone degraded to a tropical storm by 17\u00a0January. It accelerated southwestwards over Mauritius and R\u00e9union on 18\u00a0January, before degenerating to a post-tropical cyclone the next day. The remnants of Berguitta transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated over the Indian Ocean on 24\u00a0January. In Mauritius, Berguitta brought heavy rains and gusty winds to Rodrigues from 13 to 15\u00a0January. The island experienced a quarter of its average annual rainfall during those three days, resulting in widespread floods, especially in coastal areas. The island's airport was closed for nearly six days, stranding several Mauritians and tourists. Berguitta affected Mauritius's main island on 17 and 18\u00a0January, passing just south of the coast. Two days of continuous heavy rain caused severe floods that damaged buildings and at least three\u2011quarters of the island's crops. A total of 6,800 households lost power after fallen trees damaged power lines, while water supplies to the capital Port Louis were disrupted. Two people were killed on Mauritius: one in a car crash and the other after a fall from a ladder. After the storm, the government gave payouts to 13,000 affected residents, but the small size of the payments and delays in giving them out led to protests. More demonstrations ensued when families were evicted from evacuation centres. Economic losses in Mauritius were estimated at \u20a8\u00a02\u00a0billion (US$59\u00a0million).[nb 1] R\u00e9union was impacted by rain and wind mostly on 18\u00a0January. The southern part of the island was particularly hard-hit by floods and landslides. Several rainfall records set by previous cyclones were broken, particularly at Grande Coude, which experienced 1,862\u00a0mm (73.3\u00a0in) of rain in eight days, including 848\u00a0mm (33.4\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours. Widespread rain-induced flooding caused extensive damage to road infrastructure and agriculture. One person went missing after being swept away by floodwaters. Damage to the power grid left nearly 100,000 customers without electricity, while water supplies were interrupted in several communes. Economic losses in R\u00e9union were estimated at \u20ac41\u00a0million (US$48\u00a0million), including \u20ac16.7\u00a0million (US$19.7\u00a0million) of agricultural damage. The town of Cilaos was especially affected after the only road linking it to the island's ports was blocked repeatedly by landslides, severely disrupting economic activity. After Berguitta passed, the government invested several million euros into reconstruction, financial aid, and improving road infrastructure. However, recovery was interrupted by cyclones Dumazile and Fakir in March and April, respectively.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A zone of disturbed weather formed within the monsoon trough southwest of the Chagos Archipelago on 10\u00a0January.[2] As the remnants of nearby cyclones Ava and Irving moved south of the Tropic of Capricorn, the surrounding environment became generally conducive to tropical cyclogenesis, with increased convergence of surface air flows and reduced easterly wind shear. Consequently, the disturbance's center of circulation became better defined as it moved south-southwest.[3] At 12:00\u00a0UTC on 11\u00a0January, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France La R\u00e9union (MFR)\u2014the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre for the South-West Indian Ocean[4]\u2014classified the system as a tropical disturbance,[5] the third of the 2017\u201318 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.[6] At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) identified the system as a tropical depression.[7][nb 2] An intrusion of dry air on the system's western flank slowed development overnight from 11 to 12\u00a0January,[9] before a large burst of thunderstorm activity over the system's center allowed it to consolidate further.[10] The MFR classified the system as a tropical depression at 00:00\u00a0UTC on 13\u00a0January, then upgraded it further to Moderate Tropical Storm Berguitta six hours later.[5] Berguitta slowly strengthened on 13 and 14\u00a0January as it began to develop a central dense overcast.[11] During that time, a ridge strengthening south of Madagascar caused the storm to turn west then northwest while decelerating.[12] Rapid development began by 15\u00a0January while Berguitta became nearly stationary, with the MFR and the JTWC both noting the system to have reached tropical cyclone intensity early that day.[5][7] Amid high oceanic heat content and low vertical wind shear, an eye quickly formed within the small system.[13] Berguitta reached its maximum strength at 12:00\u00a0UTC on 15\u00a0January, with the MFR estimating 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph), gusts reaching 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), and a central pressure of 960\u00a0hPa (28.35\u00a0inHg).[5] This made Berguitta the season's first intense tropical cyclone on the MFR's scale.[6] Simultaneously, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[7] The cyclone's intensity levelled off thereafter, with little further change in the cloud pattern noted on satellite imagery. Berguitta started to drift west-southwestwards later on 15\u00a0January as the aforementioned ridge steering the cyclone started weakening.[14] Pronounced weakening commenced on 16\u00a0January, caused by dry air in Berguitta's northwest quadrant entraining into its circulation and eroding the eastern eyewall.[15] The eye collapsed as the central dense overcast warmed and lost symmetry,[16] leading the MFR to declare Berguitta had degraded to a severe tropical storm at 18:00\u00a0UTC.[5] On 17\u00a0January, a new ridge developing to Berguitta's east began to steer the system southwest, while causing an increase in northeasterly wind shear.[17] Consequently, further slow weakening occurred, and the MFR assessed that Berguitta's winds bottomed out at 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph) as it moved through the Mascarene Islands.[5] For the next day or two, Berguitta's structure and intensity remained relatively unchanged, with scatterometer data indicating winds stayed between 75\u201385\u00a0km/h (45\u201350\u00a0mph).[18] Afterwards, as Berguitta tracked further south, decreasing oceanic heat content caused the cyclone's cloud pattern to lose organisation.[19] The MFR declared the system post-tropical at 18:00\u00a0UTC on 19\u00a0January as it began accelerating southwards, pulled by an upper-level trough to its southeast.[5][20] Thunderstorm activity became increasingly limited on 20\u00a0January, and the JTWC assessed that Berguitta had transitioned to an extratropical cyclone by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[7][21] The remnants of Berguitta decelerated and turned east-southeast over the next few days while maintaining gale-force winds, even deepening slightly on 21\u00a0January. The system soon resumed weakening, however, and was last noted by the MFR near 40\u00b0S 65\u00b0E\ufeff / \ufeff40\u00b0S 65\u00b0E\ufeff / -40; 65 on 24\u00a0January.[5]",
      "Effects in Mauritius[edit]": "",
      "Rodrigues[edit]": "As Berguitta developed north of Rodrigues, a Class I cyclone warning was issued for the island on 13\u00a0January. This was upgraded to a Class II cyclone warning on 14\u00a0January as Berguitta strengthened and moved closer to Rodrigues.[22] From 13 to 15\u00a0January, Rodrigues experienced gusty winds and heavy rain. A 108\u00a0km/h (67\u00a0mph) wind gust was recorded in Patate-Th\u00e9ophile on Rodrigues's east coast, and a gust to 102\u00a0km/h (63\u00a0mph) was observed in Pointe-Canon along the island's north coast.[23][24] The island received a quarter of its average annual rainfall in those three days, with a peak rainfall total of 320\u00a0mm (13\u00a0in) in Citronelle.[25] A total of 25 people on the island sought shelter in evacuation centres.[26] Coastal roads were inundated and made impassable. Firefighters responded to more than 40 incidents, most of which were flood-related,[27] and the Special Mobile Force was deployed to cut down three trees that collapsed onto electrical cables.[28] The adverse weather caused Sir Ga\u00ebtan Duval Airport in Plaine-Corail to close from 13\u00a0January, leading Air Mauritius to cancel flights to the island. This left 50 Mauritians and tourists stranded.[29][30] All cyclone warnings in Rodrigues were lifted on 15\u00a0January as Berguitta moved away from the island,[31] though torrential rain continued to affect Rodrigues until 17\u00a0January.[32] Residents of Rodrigues were given a day off from work by the local government on 16\u00a0January, as some obstructed roads had yet to be cleared.[33] Sir Ga\u00ebtan Duval Airport eventually reopened in the evening of 18\u00a0January, allowing those stranded to leave the island.[34]",
      "Mauritius Island[edit]": "",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "While Berguitta moved away from Rodrigues, it turned towards the main island of Mauritius, leading authorities to issue a Class I cyclone warning for the island on the afternoon of 15\u00a0January.[31] This was raised to a Class II cyclone warning on the morning of 16\u00a0January,[35] and further upgraded to Class III just 24\u00a0hours later.[36] The MFR originally expected the centre of Berguitta to pass directly over the island;[37] the cyclone eventually passed 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi) off the coast of Souillac.[38] Berguitta's predicted trajectory and intensity generated comparisons to 1994's Cyclone Hollanda and 2002's Cyclone Dina.[39] Schools were closed from the morning of 16\u00a0January,[40] and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Centre announced that workplaces would be closed and workers placed on mandatory leave beginning on 17\u00a0January.[26] Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport was closed until further notice on the morning of 17\u00a0January,[41] leading Air Mauritius to cancel its flights and other international airlines to reschedule theirs.[42][43] The State Bank of Mauritius disabled its automated teller machines from the evening of 16\u00a0January.[44] The Judiciary of Mauritius postponed 2,512 trials scheduled for 17 and 18\u00a0January.[45] Authorities opened 172 evacuation centres across the island; a total of 4,043 people sought shelter in 79 of these centres on 17 and 18\u00a0January. Demand was greatest in the capital Port Louis, where an additional centre had to be set up on the spot.[46] At these centres, evacuees were provided with water, hot meals, snacks, and mattresses.[47] Two fatalities occurred in Mauritius due to Berguitta: a woman died in a road traffic accident on 17\u00a0January when her husband lost control of their car, and a man died on 23\u00a0January after suffering a head injury on 17\u00a0January when falling off a ladder.[48][49] Heavy rain fell almost continuously from the afternoon of 17\u00a0January till the morning of 18\u00a0January;[50] the highest recorded rainfall accumulation was 229.6\u00a0mm (9.04\u00a0in) at Mare-aux-Vacoas. The highest observed wind gusts were 83\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph), at multiple locations along the island's southwest coast.[51] Flooding occurred in many parts of the island, exacerbated by a high water table after rains from Cyclone Ava earlier in the month. Blocked drains caused by improper waste disposal and concrete walls that obstructed surface runoff were also blamed for intensifying floods.[47][52] Firefighters responded to nearly 200 distress calls on the morning of 17\u00a0January and another 106 overnight from 17 to 18\u00a0January, including at least three instances where people had to be rescued from rising floodwaters.[53][54] Fallen trees and branches knocked down power cables,[55] causing 6,800 households to lose power.[56] Roads were made impassable by fallen trees or floods in at least 22 places.[57] The Riverland Sports Club in Tamarin was severely damaged by floodwaters after a river 300\u00a0m (980\u00a0ft) away burst its banks.[58] Water supplies to Port Louis were disrupted on the morning of 18\u00a0January after mud clogged filters at a water treatment plant.[59] Agriculture on the island suffered significantly, with 75 to 80\u00a0percent of crops destroyed. Consequently, production of vegetables fell below 1,000 metric tons (1,100 short tons) per week, well under the average countrywide rate of vegetable consumption at 2,600 metric tons (2,900 short tons) a week. This led to a shortage of vegetables on the island, and vegetable prices were expected to rise by 20 to 25\u00a0percent.[60][61]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "The orange alert was lifted by 19\u00a0January as Berguitta moved away from R\u00e9union and weakened,[129] allowing damage assessments to begin and repairs to be made. \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France mobilised five teams, over a hundred technicians, and four helicopters to assess and repair damage to the power grid.[114][115] Four hundred packages of bottled water were airlifted to Saint-Louis by helicopter to address water shortages.[117] The R\u00e9union Departmental Council announced they would invest \u20ac20\u00a0million (US$24\u00a0million) into reconstruction efforts,[130] and allocated an additional \u20ac5\u00a0million (US$5.9\u00a0million) to road infrastructure in the yearly budget.[131] Businesses affected by Berguitta received payouts between \u20ac500 and \u20ac1500 (US$590 and US$1,800) as compensation for their losses.[132] A state of natural disaster was recognised in the communes of Cilaos, Entre-Deux, L'\u00c9tang-Sal\u00e9, Le Tampon, Les Avirons, Petite-\u00cele, Saint-Joseph, Saint-Leu, Saint-Louis, and Saint-Pierre on 30\u00a0January, and in Saint-Philippe on 21\u00a0February. This would allow the communes to submit claims to their insurers to reduce the cost of damage.[133] The Ministry of the Overseas, based in Metropolitan France, granted R\u00e9union access to the Overseas Relief Fund on 6\u00a0February as a \"show of national solidarity\".[134] The town of Cilaos was left cut off for several weeks as constant rockfalls and landslides during and after Berguitta repeatedly blocked the Route de Cilaos, the only road from Cilaos to the coast and its ports. Economic activity in the town thus came to a standstill, placing up to 1,500 jobs under threat.[135][136] A project was initiated to rebuild bridges across the Saint-Etienne River by temporarily damming it,[137] with costs estimated at over \u20ac100\u00a0million (US$120\u00a0million).[138] To support affected businesses, in early February, authorities allocated a \u20ac2\u00a0million (US$2.4\u00a0million) budget for financial aid.[139] An additional \u20ac300,000 (US$350,000) from an emergency relief fund was promised, but delays in distributing the funds sparked a protest by business owners outside the Chamber of Commerce and Industry office in Saint-Pierre on 12\u00a0March.[136] Another \u20ac600,000 (US$710,000) was given to affected companies in Cilaos and Grand Bassin, Le Tampon in late March.[140] R\u00e9union's recovery following Berguitta was disrupted in early March by Cyclone Dumazile. Newly planted crops were destroyed by Dumazile's winds and rains and some soils became unusable for agriculture after being further waterlogged, leading to shortages of fruits and vegetables once again.[141] Works on repairing the Route de Cilaos were paused partly due to Dumazile's passage, angering residents of Cilaos.[142] Recovery efforts were set back even further in April when Cyclone Fakir produced similar effects to Berguitta.[143] The similar situations experienced during Berguitta and Fakir, where rainfall instead of wind was the main threat, led to a redesign of cyclone warnings on R\u00e9union. Rainfall intensity could now be a trigger for warnings, and a new \"purple alert\" was added to reflect exceptionally dangerous conditions.[144][145]",
      "Effects in R\u00e9union[edit]": "",
      "Preparations[edit]": "R\u00e9union was placed on pre-alert at noon on 15\u00a0January while Berguitta was still 855\u00a0km (530\u00a0mi) east-northeast of the island.[92] Panic buying at supermarkets began as soon as 14\u00a0January, as initial forecasts by the MFR depicted Berguitta passing close to or over R\u00e9union.[93] Shelves were quickly emptied of water and canned food while long queues formed outside supermarkets, causing frustration among some R\u00e9unionese.[94][95] Several public facilities and tourist attractions, such as public swimming pools, museums, and parks, were closed from 16\u00a0January as the weather deteriorated.[96] \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France readied its staff and equipment for addressing potential damage to the power grid.[97] Several airlines, including Air Austral, Air France, Corsair, XL Airways, Air Mauritius, and French Blue, modified their flight schedules from 16\u00a0January to avoid the bad weather.[98] The alert level was raised to orange on 17\u00a0January,[99] allowing the opening of evacuation shelters across the island.[100] The University of Reunion Island closed its campus from the afternoon of 17\u00a0January till the morning of 22\u00a0January.[101] Roland Garros Airport closed in the evening of 17\u00a0January until the morning of 19\u00a0January.[102][103] Boaters at the ports of Sainte-Marie and Saint-Gilles were forbidden to go out to sea by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.[104] The red alert was controversially not issued due to a lack of recorded hurricane-force winds, even as rainfall over the island grew more intense and conditions became more hazardous. At the same time, authorities enacted increasingly stringent preventive measures more characteristic of a red alert.[105][106]",
      "Impact[edit]": "R\u00e9union was buffeted by heavy rains and gusty winds on most of 18\u00a0January as Berguitta passed 55\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) east-southeast of the island.[103] A peak gust of 144\u00a0km/h (89\u00a0mph) was observed in Gros-Piton, Sainte-Rose on the morning of 18\u00a0January. Intense torrential rainfall occurred over the island beginning late on 17\u00a0January, though the influence of Berguitta's circulation generated rain on the island as early as 11\u00a0January. The highest rainfall in R\u00e9union occurred at Grand Coude, Saint-Joseph, with a 24-hour rainfall total of 848\u00a0mm (33.4\u00a0in), a 48-hour total of 981\u00a0mm (38.6\u00a0in), and an eight-day total from 11 to 18\u00a0January of 1,862\u00a0mm (73.3\u00a0in). These all broke location-specific records for rainfall previously held by cyclones Connie, Hollanda, and Hyacinthe, a pattern observed in several other places in the south and southwest parts of R\u00e9union.[107] With soils already near or at saturation because of heavy rains from Cyclone Ava from 2 to 8\u00a0January, the addition of intense rainfall from Berguitta caused significant flooding all over R\u00e9union, particularly in the south of the island.[108] Roads were obstructed by fallen trees and landslides while bridges were washed out by swollen rivers;[109] the communes of Le Port, Le Tampon, and Saint-Leu issued traffic bans amid the perilous driving conditions.[102] The Route du Littoral and the Route de Cilaos highways were severely damaged and obstructed by debris.[110] Bassin Plat in Saint-Pierre was completely inundated as the nearby Rivi\u00e8re d'Abord burst its banks, forcing several hundred of the town's inhabitants to evacuate.[111] A cemetery in Saint-Leu was flooded, along with nearby houses.[112] Amid the widespread flooding, the gendarmerie, police, firefighters, and French Army soldiers conducted a total of 190 interventions during the storm and rescued 86 people. One person in L'\u00c9tang-Sal\u00e9 went missing after being swept away by floodwaters.[113] Fallen trees damaged power lines in many places,[114] leaving up to 100,000 customers of \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France without power.[115] The whole of Saint-Joseph and Saint-Philippe lost access to potable water. Smaller disruptions to water supplies were felt in Entre-Deux, Les Avirons, Le Tampon,[116] and Saint-Louis.[117] Along R\u00e9union's western coast, large waves from Berguitta contributed to severe coastal erosion,[118] and washed up thousands of sea urchins along the beaches of Petit Boucan in Saint-Gilles.[119] Floods from Berguitta swept out minerals and waste into the lagoon off Saint-Leu, contributing to mass coral deaths.[120] The agricultural sector suffered significant damage as the heavy rains caused landslides and oversaturated the soil, destroying crops and resulting in some agricultural grounds becoming unusable.[121] A chicken farm in Saint-Joseph recorded losses of \u20ac80,000 (US$94,000) after 13,700 of its 14,000 chickens drowned.[122] A farmer in Le Tampon lost 50,000 pineapple plants worth \u20ac45,000 (US$53,000)\u2014almost his entire plantation.[123] Another 290 hectares (720 acres) of vegetable crops in the commune were destroyed. Across the island, about 90\u00a0km (55\u00a0mi) of logging roads were washed away by floods and landslides. About 200 beehives were washed away and another 200 cattle died. Damage to agriculture in R\u00e9union was at least \u20ac16.7\u00a0million (US$19.7\u00a0million).[124] Overall economic losses across the island were estimated at \u20ac41\u00a0million (US$48\u00a0million),[125] including \u20ac2.5\u20133\u00a0million (US$3.0\u20133.5\u00a0million) of damage in L'\u00c9tang-Sal\u00e9,[126] \u20ac2\u00a0million (US$2.4\u00a0million) in Saint-Philippe,[127] and \u20ac8\u00a0million (US$9.5\u00a0million) in Petite-\u00cele.[128]",

      "Hurricane Hilary (1993)": "Hurricane Hilary was a Category\u00a03 hurricane during the 1993 Pacific hurricane season that brought significant rainfall to the Sonoran Desert region of Mexico and the United States in August of that year. Additionally, its remnants in part caused significant flooding in the Midwestern United States. A westward moving tropical depression gradually developed on August\u00a017 south of the Mexican coast, attaining hurricane status two days later. The storm further intensified into a Category\u00a03 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h). By August\u00a023, the hurricane nearly stalled while interacting with Tropical Storm Irwin. Executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary degraded to tropical storm intensity and took a northerly track for the remainder of its existence. The storm made two landfalls in Mexico, one in Baja California Sur on August\u00a025 and one in Sonora the following day. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for much of the southern Mexican coastline; however, they were later discontinued when the threat ended, but were issued again when the system posed a threat to the Baja California Peninsula. Hilary dropped in excess of 5\u00a0in (130\u00a0mm) rain along its path in some areas, and flash flooding in California and Iowa.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Several small areas of convection developed in association with a tropical wave on August\u00a014 near Central America. Over the next two days, the convection migrated across Central America, and then entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec on August\u00a016. The next morning, Tropical Depression Nine-E formed south of an upper-level low that was located in the Gulf of Mexico. Banding features slowly increased in coverage, and on August\u00a018, the depression intensified, becoming Tropical Storm Hilary about 100\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) south of the Pacific coast of Mexico.[1] Hilary steadily gained strength,[2] but its outflow remained restricted.[3] Moving northwest on a track parallel to the coast of Mexico at around 10\u00a0mi (16\u00a0km) due to a complex steering pattern,[1] Hilary was initially poorly organized and its low-level circulation was tough to find. The storm failed to intensify further[4] until August\u00a019, when the storm was upgraded into a hurricane after the cyclone developed very cold cloud tops.[1] Even though most computer models expected Hilary to remain offshore, meteorologists suggested there was a possibility of making landfall near Manzanillo.[5] The next day, an eye formed;[1] subsequently, Hilary reached Category 2 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.[6] By the time, the hurricane had grown into a large cyclone with gale-force winds extending out 130\u00a0mi (210\u00a0km) from the center.[1] Under weak steering currents, Hilary became a major hurricane, a cyclone with winds of 111\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) or higher, early on August\u00a021.[7] Shortly thereafter, Hilary reached its peak intensity with winds of 120\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h). Around this time, Hurricane Hilary developed a 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) eye. Later that day, however, the eye had shrunk to about 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) in diameter.[1] The eye, which was very well-defined, was surrounded by a central dense overcast, a large mass of deep convection.[8] Shortly after its peak, Hurricane Hilary's motion became unsteady. After nearly stalling, the hurricane turned to the west on August\u00a022, only to become nearly stationary again the next day. Slowly executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Storm Irwin which was several hundred miles southeast.[1] Meanwhile, Hilary began to weaken, by early on August\u00a022, the eye became poorly defined and convection diminished.[9] The eye dissipated within 12 hours, and the winds quickly diminished to 85\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).[10] Later that day, the thunderstorm activity became partially exposed from the center,[11] and on August\u00a023, Hilary was downgraded to a tropical storm due to lack of organization.[12] The interaction continued to weaken Hilary, leaving it with little thunderstorm activity and winds of just 40\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h) on August\u00a024, before resuming a northerly motion. Around this time, Hilary finally absorbed Irwin. While Hilary began to traverse cooler waters, the environment became more favorable. Upon developing a 200 mb anticyclone, Hilary began to revive based on data from satellite imagery and ship reports. Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall in Baja California Sur on two separate occasions as a strong tropical storm on August\u00a025. Weakening over land, the cyclone regenerated deep convection over the Gulf of California. As a tropical depression, Hilary made its final landfall on August\u00a026 just west of Hermosillo in Sonora. While most of the mid to upper level moisture associated with the storm got pulled inland by a shortwave trough, the low level center dissipated in the northern Gulf on August\u00a027.[13]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Due to Hilary's proximity to Mexico on August\u00a020, hurricane watches were issued for much of the southern coastline; however, they were later discontinued. Once the system began its northward track, further watches and warnings were issued for the Baja California Peninsula and the Gulf of California coastline.[14] Heavy rains, with a maximum recorded amount of 11.35\u00a0in (288\u00a0mm) in Derivorda  Jale, Colima, were accompanied the storm. Along the Baja California Peninsula, a statewide rainfall total of 4.33\u00a0in (110\u00a0mm) fell in Huerta Vieja. However, no damage or loss of life took place.[13][15] Winds along the peninsula were strong, though not as strong as Hurricane Calvin, a hurricane which struck the peninsula during July 1993.[16] The outer bands of Hurricane Hilary also brought localized downpours to parts of California, resulting in flash floods.[17] In Arizona,  3.75 inches (95\u00a0mm) of rain fell on Green Valley, and 3.50 inches (89\u00a0mm) of precipitation was recorded at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, resulting in flash flooding.[18] Hilary produced a surge of moisture that dropped over 25% of the summer rainfall in portions of New Mexico.[19] The remains of Hilary combined with a cold front to produce widespread flooding across the Midwestern United States.[20] About 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) fell in some areas of Iowa, forcing rivers and streams to overflow its banks. Hundreds of people evacuated their homes.[21]",

      "2011 China floods": " The 2011 China floods were a series of floods from June to September 2011 that occurred in central and southern parts of the People's Republic of China.[1] They were caused by heavy rain that inundated portions of 12 provinces, leaving other provinces still suffering a prolonged drought,[2][3] and with direct economic losses of nearly US$6.5 billion.[4]",
      "Effects[edit]": "Conflicting reports suggested that either 12 or 13 provinces and autonomous regions had been hit by heavy floods.[3][5] Weather forecasts predicted the rain would continue,[6] and the government warned of possible mudslides.[6] On 10 June 2011, the China's Flood Control Office reported that the tropical storm Sarika would land somewhere between the city of Shanwei in Guangdong province and Zhangpu in nearby Fujian province on 11 June, bringing more severe flooding.[7] China's Meteorological Administration issued a level 3 emergency alert for the Yangtze on 12 June.[8] As of 17 June, the flood alert had been raised to a level 4 (the maximum alert level) \u2013 with 555,000 people being evacuated across the Yangtze Basin.[9] Severe tropical storm Meari caused flooding in Liaoning, Zhejiang and Shandong provinces, by 27 June flooding had forced the evacuation of 7,500 people, destroyed 400 homes and covered 17 counties including 33,000 hectares of farmland, affecting 164,000 people.[10]",
      "Casualties[edit]": "At least 54 people had died by 9 June as a result of the flooding.[11] A further forty-one people were reported dead on 10 June, bringing the total dead to at least 97,[12] and by 13 June official totals reported at least 105 were dead and 63 missing.[13] State media announced that between 13 and 17 June, a further 19 people were killed, with seven more missing from Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces and Chongqing municipality.[9] Later updates suggested 25 dead and 25 missing between those dates.[14] However, unofficial totals on 17 June (based on the reports from the various provinces) have the casualties at 178 dead and 68 missing. Official totals from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters on 30 June: at least 239 dead, 86 missing. 36.7 million people have been affected, about 106,500 houses and about 1.16 million hectares of crops destroyed, with a total of 43.2 billion yuan ($6.65 billion) in economic costs.[4]",
      "Economic cost[edit]": "By 9 June, the floods were estimated to have destroyed nearly 7,500 houses and submerged 255,000 hectares (630,000 acres) of farmland, causing direct losses of 4.92 billion yuan (US$760 million, \u20ac745 million).[1] By 10 June, an estimated 4.81 million people were affected by the floods.[11]\nFour days later (14 June), a total of over 10 million people were affected, and direct economic losses of 8.7 billion yuan (US$1.3 billion) had been inflicted.[5] On 17 June, official reports of direct economic losses resulting from this round of rainstorms amounted to 12.85 billion yuan (US$1.98 billion, \u20ac1.5 billion), which is more than the combined direct economic losses that resulted from the two previous rounds of heavy rains, bringing the total losses to nearly US$3.3 billion, \u20ac2.5 billion.[14] The Chinese government plans to spend 35 million yuan (US$5.39 million, \u20ac5 million) to provide relief to those in Guizhou.[15] On 22 June, the Chinese government set aside 340 million yuan for flood relief.[16]",

      "Cyclone Ita": "  Severe Tropical Cyclone Ita was the strongest tropical cyclone in the Australian region by central pressure since George in 2007, and by wind speed since Monica in 2006. The system was first identified over the Solomon Islands as a tropical low on 1 April 2014, and gradually moved westward, eventually reaching cyclone intensity on 5 April. On 10 April, Ita intensified rapidly into a powerful Category 5 system on the Australian Scale, but it weakened to a Category 4 system in the hours immediately preceding landfall the following day. At the time of landfall at Cape Flattery at 12 April 22:00 (UTC+10), the cyclone's Dvorak intensity was approximately T5.0, consistent with a weak Category 4 system, and considerably lower than the T6.5 observed when the system was at its peak intensity. Meteorologists noted the system had, at that time, begun an eyewall replacement cycle; as a result, the system was considerably less powerful than various intensity scales  had predicted. As a result, Ita's impact on terrain was lessened. Owing to the rapid degradation of the cyclone before landfall, structural damage was relatively low at A$8.4\u00a0million (US$7.9\u00a0million). However, the agricultural industry suffered extensive impacts and total losses reached A$1.1\u00a0billion (US$1\u00a0billion).",
      "Meteorological history": "On 1 April 2014, a broad, poorly-defined area of low pressure consolidated over the Solomon Islands. Initially only accompanied by flaring convection, the system persisted in a region of low wind shear and strong outflow which promoted gradual development.[1] Upon formation, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Brisbane monitored the system as a tropical low.[2] Banding features gradually developed and wrapped around the circulation and deep convection became persistent by 2\u00a0April.[3] A large central dense overcast developed over the low early on 3\u00a0April, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert.[4] After moving away from Papua New Guinea, Ita underwent explosive intensification and attained its peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone early on 11\u00a0April. Winds were estimated to have reached 220\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph) alongside a minimum central pressure of 922\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.23\u00a0inHg). Turning to the south-southeast, the storm weakened somewhat before making landfall near Cape Flattery as a Category\u00a04 later on 11\u00a0April. An automated weather station on Lizard Island, roughly 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) from the storm's centre, recorded a pressure of 954\u00a0mbar (hPa; 28.17\u00a0inHg). Once onshore Ita weakened dramatically to a Category\u00a01 within 18\u00a0hours. Maintaining gale-force winds the storm turned southwest and accelerated, eventually moving offshore north of Mackay on 13\u00a0April. The following day Ita transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it moved away from Australia and towards New Zealand.[5] Ita's extratropical remnants combined with a low pressure system to the south and re-intensified. On 17 April, the low-level circulation center of the storm collapsed, as Ita affected New Zealand, bringing heavy rainfall and powerful winds.[6] On 18 April, Ita's remnants curved to the west and the south, before dissipating offshore of New Zealand later on the same day.",
      "Preparations and impact": "",
      "Solomon Islands": "Soon after the floods, Honiara and Guadalcanal were declared disaster areas by the Solomon Government.[44] Debris left behind by the floods initially hampered relief efforts, with the runway at Honiara International Airport blocked by two destroyed homes. Food supplies started running low as the Red Cross provided aid to the thousands homeless. The airport was reopened on 6\u00a0April, allowing for supplies from Australia and New Zealand to be delivered.[14] Roughly 20\u00a0percent of Honiara population relocated to evacuation centers as entire communities were swept away.[45] New Zealand offered an immediate NZ$300,000 in funds and deployed a C-130 Hercules with supplies and emergency response personnel.[45] Australia donated A$250,000 on 6\u00a0April and sent engineers and response teams to aid in relief efforts.[46] On 8\u00a0April, Australia increased its aid package to A$3\u00a0million while New Zealand provided an additional NZ$1.2\u00a0million.[12][47] Papua New Guinea and Taiwan provided PGK\u00a01\u00a0million and US$200,000 in funds, respectively.[48][49] In the immediate aftermath of the floods, there were fears that the flooding could worsen an already ongoing dengue fever outbreak and cause outbreaks of diarrhea and conjunctivitis.[12] Over the following two months, a widespread rotavirus outbreak unfolded in Honiara, Guadalcanal, and Gizo, with more than 1,000\u00a0people falling ill. Severe cases of diarrhea became common among children, with 18\u00a0dying as a result in early June.[50][51] By mid-July, the outbreak was fully contained with no further cases of the disease.[52] Additionally, 24\u00a0people contracted leprosy in Honiara within a shelter.[53]",
      "Papua New Guinea": "On 15\u00a0April, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill and Speaker of Parliament Theo Zurenuoc provided PGK300,000 (US$113,700) in funds to Milne Bay Province.[21] The Papua New Guinea Defence Force was dispatched to deliver relief supplies to the region. Damage surveys were conducted simultaneously using the Defense Force's helicopters to determine the areas in need of the most immediate aid.[54] Ten relief teams were dispatched on 16\u00a0April to assist with clean up efforts. The nation's health office also warned of the dangers of post-storm diseases due to damaged sewer systems. Communications with the outermost islands of the province remained difficult and limited to short-distance radio.[55] By 17\u00a0April, a barge with 57\u00a0bales of rice was sent to Wari island where thousands of residents were in need of food.[56]",
      "Australia": "Owing to the severity of agricultural damage, the average cost of avocados, bananas, iceberg lettuce, and papayas increased.[57]",
      "New Zealand": "The remnants of Ita brought heavy rains and strong winds to much of New Zealand on 17\u00a0April. Winds, peaking at 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph) in Westport, downed many trees and power lines.[37][38] Much of the country experienced gale-force winds, though the North Island and northwestern areas of the South Island bore the brunt of the storm. Numerous cars were rolled by the winds, including one which was blown off a bridge over the Haast River. Buses transporting workers from the Stockton Mine were also knocked over. Much of Westport was isolated by downed trees and the whole Buller District was left without electricity when the transmission lines were damaged. In Auckland, tidal and flash flooding closed several roads and trapped residents. Gusts on the Auckland Harbour Bridge peaked at 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph). Throughout Auckland, at least 15,000\u00a0people were without power.[38] Entire hillsides reportedly collapsed in rural areas of Clarence and Ward. Agricultural damage in parts of the South Island were compared to Cyclone Bola in 1988, a storm regarded as one of the worst to ever strike New Zealand.[39] Throughout the Grey District, 39\u00a0homes were rendered uninhabitable while at least 60\u00a0other structures sustained varying degrees of damage. Losses in the district were estimated to be in excess of NZ$20\u00a0million (US$17.1\u00a0million).[40] Throughout New Zealand, insured losses amounted to NZ$55.3\u00a0million (US$42.9\u00a0million).[41]",
      "Aftermath": "In November 2014, the name Ita was retired from the list of names in the Australian basin and replaced with Ivana.[42] In a situation unusual for a cyclone name, a second unused name on the pre-2014 list, Ira,[43] would also be replaced at the same time by Irving due to similar spelling and pronunciation. Irving would ultimately be used for the first time in the 2017-18 season.",
      "Earthquakes": "On 4\u00a0April (5\u00a0April local time[8]) a 6.0\u00a0MW earthquake, with its epicenter on Makira Island, struck the Solomon Islands.[58] Though no reports of damage were received in relation to it, officials were concerned about the possibility of landslides resulting from it.[8] Two more large earthquakes, a 7.1\u00a0MW followed by a 6.5\u00a0MW, struck near the region on 11\u00a0April;[59][60] resulting in two deaths and causing significant damage in parts of Papua New Guinea.[61][62] On 12\u00a0April, a 7.6\u00a0MW earthquake occurred just south of Makira Island and was followed by a 7.4\u00a0MW the next day.[63][64] Though the earthquakes only produced a localised tsunami, with limited effects,[65] they prompted evacuations and delayed relief efforts across the Solomon Islands.[66] Another tsunami warning was issued on 19\u00a0April following two more large earthquakes, 6.6\u00a0MW and 7.5\u00a0MW, near Papua New Guinea.[67][68][69]",

      "Tropical Storm Kelly": " Severe Tropical Storm Kelly, known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Daling, was a weak but destructive tropical storm that struck the Philippines in June\u00a01981. A tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression east of the Philippines on June\u00a028. It tracked westward, reaching tropical storm on June\u00a030 before hitting the central Philippines. Kelly weakened over the islands, but re-strengthened over the South China Sea, nearly attaining typhoon status on July\u00a02. The system passed through the southern Hainan Island on July\u00a03. The cyclone then crossed the Gulf of Tonkin as a weakening tropical storm, and made landfall in northern Vietnam on July\u00a04 as a tropical storm. Kelly dissipated two days later inland. Tropical Storm Kelly was the worst storm to affect the Philippines in eight months. Nine towns in an 6,920\u00a0km (4,300\u00a0mi) area near the Mayon Volcano sustained flooding. Over 1,450\u00a0km (900\u00a0mi) of railways lines were washed out. At least 800\u00a0homes were destroyed while 3,845\u00a0ha (9,500 acres) of rice fields were ruined. More than 3,600\u00a0individuals were displaced. Overall, damage totaled to $7.8\u00a0million (1981\u00a0USD).[nb 1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Tropical Storm Kelly can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather that was first detected by weather satellite imagery on June\u00a025. Although the system was well-organized at this time, there was little evidence of a low-level circulation.[1][nb 2] Despite this, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the system.[3][nb 3] Meanwhile, Dvorak classifications were placed at T2.5, equivalent to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph). Based on this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued that evening as the system moved west. However, on June\u00a026, the TCFA was cancelled. Midday on June\u00a028, following an increase in convection, the TCFA was re-issued.[1] On that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Daling.[5][6] After further development and a subsequent TCFA, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as a tropical depression on June\u00a030.[1] At 0600\u00a0UTC on June\u00a030, the JTWC upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Kelly.[7] Twelve hours later, the JMA followed suit.[3] At this time, Tropical storm Kelly moved ashore along the central Philippines. Due to land interaction, the tropical cyclone became less organized. Six hours after landfall, the JTWC downgraded Kelly into a depression,[1] even though the JMA maintained Kelly as a tropical storm thorough its passage through the country.[3] After emerging into the South China Sea, Kelly resumed deepening. At 0600\u00a0UTC on July\u00a01, the JTWC re-upgraded Kelly into a tropical storm.[1] After turning northwest,[7] After exiting PASGA's warning zone,[5] Kelly continued to strengthen, and midday on July 2, the JMA estimated that the storm reached its peak intensity of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).[3] Several hours later, the JTWC upgraded Kelly to a typhoon. At 0300\u00a0UTC on July\u00a03, surface observations from the Paracel Islands indicated winds of 134\u00a0km/h (83\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 970\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg). Based on this, the JTWC reported that Kelly reached its peak wind speed of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[1] Meanwhile, the JMA noted that Kelly attained its peak barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg).[1] Thereafter, the storm's eye became less defined and the surrounding convection weakened. On the evening of July\u00a03, the eye collapsed as Kelly skirted southern Hai-nan. Due to land interaction, Kelly continued to weaken and early on July\u00a04, the JTWC downgraded the typhoon into a tropical storm. Later that morning, the eye briefly re-developed over the Gulf of Tonkin;[1] however, no re-intensification occurred[7] as Kelly remained poorly organized.[1] Late on July\u00a04, Kelly made landfall as a 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) tropical storm[7] 185\u00a0km (115\u00a0mi) south of Hanoi in Vietnam. On July\u00a05, the JTWC stopped monitoring the system as it had moved inland.[1] The JMA followed suit the next day.[3]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "Tropical Storm Kelly was the worst storm to affect the Philippines in eight months. Mudslides were reported along the slopes of the Mayon volcano,[8] as a result, many nearby villages were destroyed.[9] Some people were buried under rocks and debris due to mudslides.[10] Nine towns in an 6,920\u00a0km (4,300\u00a0mi) area were flooded.[8] Huts and rice feels were inundated by mud in debris in parts of Legaspi, Daragan, Ligao, and Camalig.[9] The towns of Ligao, Oas, Camalig and Guinobatan were the worst affected by Kelly.[10] Although winds were not very strong, many rivers overflowed their banks.[8] In the Albay Province, more than 1,450\u00a0km (900\u00a0mi) of railways lines were washed out. Over 800\u00a0dwellings were destroyed,[11] including 597\u00a0houses made of light wood and straw,[12] were destroyed and 9,500 acres (3,845\u00a0ha) of rice field were destroyed.[11] More than 3,600\u00a0persons lost their homes.[13] One hundred ninety-two fatalities were reported,[14] including 120\u00a0casualties in the Albay Province[8] and five in Ligao.[12] Nine cities sustained fatalities near the Mayon volcano,[15][16] Twelve children also died.[17] Nine individuals were also listed missing[10] and 30\u00a0were injured.[13] Most of the fatalities were due to drownings.[9] Overall, damage totaled to $7.8\u00a0million,[6] including $3.7\u00a0million from infrastructure.[5] Losses were estimated at $1.1\u00a0million.[12] Following the storm, relief teams were sent in to provide aid such as rice and sardines for the homeless.[11][13] A few days following Kelly, the island nation was struck by Tropical Storm Lynn, which was responsible for further destruction.[18]",

      "Typhoon Cary (1987)": " Typhoon Cary, known as Typhoon Ising in the Philippines, was the second of two tropical cyclones to affect Vietnam in a week. An area of disturbed weather developed southwest of Pohnpei on August\u00a06, 1987. The system initially remained disorganized, but by August\u00a014, Cary had attained tropical storm intensity. After initially moving north-northwest, Cary turned west-northwest, although intensification was slow to occur. On August\u00a015, Cary was upgraded into a typhoon, and on August\u00a017, the typhoon peaked in intensity. Typhoon Cary then made landfall in northern Luzon while at peak intensity. Across the Philippines, 954\u00a0houses were damaged and an additional 89\u00a0were destroyed, which left 55,567\u00a0people, or 13,247\u00a0families that were either homeless or otherwise sought shelter. Five people died in the country while damage totaled $5.58\u00a0million (1987\u00a0USD), including $1.45\u00a0million from agriculture and $4.13\u00a0million from infrastructure. The storm weakened over land, but re-intensified into a typhoon over the South China Sea. On August\u00a021, Typhoon Cary passed just south of Hainan, where hundreds of homes were damaged but no fatalities occurred, and subsequently entered the Gulf of Tonkin. The storm weakened as it approached Vietnam, and on August\u00a023, the storm dissipated inland over Laos. Across Vietnam, almost 40,000\u00a0ha (98,840 acres) of land were flooded or destroyed. Twenty people were killed and many others were injured.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Typhoon Cary can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather that first developed within the monsoon trough on August\u00a06  about 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) southwest of Pohnpei, which is located in the eastern Caroline Islands. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started watching the system.[1] On August 8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) followed suit.[2][nb 1][4] Over the ensuing four days, the storm's circulation remained broad and its convection was poorly organized. On August\u00a012, upper-level outflow improved in all four quadrants, which resulted in the JTWC issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA). At 23:02 UTC, Hurricane Hunters measured flight level winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 996\u00a0mbar (29.4\u00a0inHg). Based on this and satellite intensity estimates of 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph), the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Storm Cary[1] while the storm was located around 1,580\u00a0km (980\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Manila.[5] However, post-season analysis by the JTWC revealed that this occurred at 12:00 UTC on August 12.[1] Following behind Typhoon Betty,[1] Cary initially moved north-northwest, only to turn west-northwest[5] under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the storm's north. Initially, Betty's outflow inhibited development, but conditions aloft became more favorable once Betty weakened and passed over the Philippines. Dvorak intensity estimates suggested that the typhoon began to rapidly intensify. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft fix around midday on August\u00a014 revealed that the storm was actually weakening and its center was becoming difficult to locate.[1] Despite these developments, the JMA upgraded Cary into a tropical storm at noon that day.[6][nb 2] Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also started tracking the storm and assigned it with the name Ising.[8] Early on August\u00a015, the JTWC reported that Cary attained typhoon intensity,[4] while the JMA upgraded Cary into a severe tropical storm.[2] The final Western Pacific Hurricane Hunter mission \u2013 associated with the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron \u2013 was flown through Cary later that day, reporting winds of 115\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 990\u00a0mbar (29\u00a0inHg). This was significantly lower than the Dvorak-based 170\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) operational estimate from the JTWC.[1] At around 12:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a016, the JMA classified Cary as a typhoon.[2] Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye appeared on satellite imagery.[5] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on August 17, the JTWC also estimated Cary reached its peak intensity, with winds of 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph).[1] Six hours later, the JMA estimated that Cary attained winds of 135\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph), its peak intensity.[2] Shortly after attaining maximum intensity, Typhoon Cary turned slightly south of west[5] and made landfall on eastern Luzon. Cary weakened steadily over land,[1] and both the JMA and JTWC estimated that Cary weakened below typhoon intensity.[6] After entering the South China Sea, however, Cary turned west and began to re-intensify.[5] On the morning of August\u00a019, the JMA re-upgraded Cary into a typhoon,[2] with the JTWC following suit 36\u00a0hours later.[4] At 18:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a021, Cary passed less than 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) south of Hainan as a minimal typhoon. Accelerating towards the west, Typhoon Cary emerged into the Gulf of Tonkin before making landfall at noon on August\u00a012 in northern Vietnam.[1] At the time of landfall, the JTWC and JMA estimated winds of 70\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h) and 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h) respectively.[6] the JTWC stopped tracking the system immediately after landfall,[1] but the JMA continued to follow the system through the day of August\u00a023[2] as the cyclone moved into northern Laos.[5] The remnants of Cary eventually tracked into Burma before losing its identity.[1]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "Typhoon Cary threatened the Philippines less than a week after the country was devastated by Typhoon Betty. To avoid a repeat of Betty, much of northern Luzon was placed under a typhoon alert.[9] Storm warnings were issued for the metropolitan area of Manila.[10] Philippine Airlines canceled flights between Manila and three cities in northern Luzon. Schools were closed in several provinces over the northern portion of Luzon.[11] Near where the typhoon moved ashore, in Dagupan, authorities shut off water and electricity.[11] A total of 1,800\u00a0people were evacuated in the resort town of Baguio, which is located 160\u00a0km (100\u00a0mi) north of Manila,[12] due to landslides.[13] The typhoon leveled a banana plantation in the Pangasinan province and caused floods that damaged two bridges in Ilocos and Cagayan provinces. Across the capital city of Manila, heavy rains led to street flooding.[14] Nationwide, 954\u00a0homes were damaged and an additional 89\u00a0were destroyed, which resulted in 55,567\u00a0people or 13,247\u00a0families that either south shelter or were homeless. Five people were killed in the country.[15] The storm inflicted $5.58\u00a0million in damage to the country, including $1.45\u00a0million from agriculture and $4.13\u00a0million from infrastructure.[16][nb 3]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "The typhoon passed close to Hainan Island on August\u00a021, where hurricane-force winds and torrential rain resulted in the disruption of water and electrical services. Hundreds of houses were damaged and more than 500\u00a0ha (1,235 acres) of crops were destroyed, but no deaths on the island occurred. After passing Hainan Island, the storm passed close enough to prompt a No 1. hurricane signal for Hong Kong, but this warning was dropped on August\u00a020 as the storm receded. In all, the storm brought isolated showers to the area, with rainfall peaking at 45.5\u00a0mm (1.79\u00a0in) at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory. A peak wind gust of 94\u00a0km/h (58\u00a0mph) was measured in Tai Mo Shan. Throughout the vicinity of Hong Kong, no deaths or damage were reported.[5] Cary struck Vietnam six days after Betty, resulting in additional flooding rains across the area. Throughout the coastal provinces of Thanh Hoa, Ha Nam Ninh, Thai Binh and Haiphong, floodwaters from the storm overflowed dikes. Furthermore, storm surge and heavy rains damaged 30,350\u00a0ha (75,000 acres) of rice fields and more than 5,060\u00a0ha (12,500 acres) of other cultivated land in Nghe Tinh. There, the storm damaged many houses, warehouses, schools, and medical facilities. Further south, 3,035\u00a0ha (7,500 acres) of rice fields were inundated in Binh Tri Tien.[17] Overall, 20\u00a0people were killed in the country and several others were injured.[5]",

      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On June\u00a01, an area of low pressure developed over the Laccadive Islands. Two days later, the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system as it became better organized. Early on June\u00a04, the JTWC issued its first advisory on Tropical Cyclone 03A.[1] Around the same time, the IMD began monitoring the system as Depression ARB 02. Shortly after, the depression was upgraded to a deep depression and further strengthened into a cyclonic storm the following day.[2] The small storm moved slowly towards the west and weakened as wind shear began to increase. The storm weakened below tropical storm intensity later that day and the initial final advisory was issued. However, the system redeveloped and advisories resumed the next day. The storm gradually intensified as it moved towards the northwest.[3] Dvorak satellite intensity estimates on June\u00a06 reached T4.0, corresponding to an intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph).[3] The IMD also marked the increase in intensity, upgrading ARB 02 to a severe cyclonic storm.[2] Around this time, the storm began to turn towards the north and accelerate due to an approaching mid-level trough. As the storm neared the Indian coastline, an eye developed and the storm strengthened into the equivalent of a major hurricane with winds reaching 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph).[1] The IMD assessed the storm to be a very severe cyclonic storm at this time, with winds up to 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph) and a barometric pressure of 958\u00a0mbar (hPa).[2] After slightly weakening early on June\u00a09,[3] 03A re-strengthened, attaining its peak intensity with winds of 195\u00a0km/h (120\u00a0mph).[1] Then it made landfall near Porbandar in the Indian state of Gujarat[3] between 01:00 and 02:00\u00a0UTC.[2] The storm weakened following landfall and the JTWC issued their final advisory later that day.[1] The IMD continued to monitor ARB 02 until June\u00a010, by which time it had weakened to a depression before dissipating.[2]",
      "Impact and aftermath[edit]": "Tropical Cyclone 03A brought a large storm surge of 4.9\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) which devastated coastal communities and salt mines.[3] An estimated 4,000 to 10,000 people were killed by the storm,[4][5] many of whom were salt mine workers who did not own a radio and received little or no warning of the cyclone. The large loss of life was partially attributed to contractors who wanted to continue making profits and did not inform their workers of the approaching storm.[3] According to the official figures, 1,173 people died and 1,774 people went missing.[5] Also, the region had witnessed only 17 cyclones since 1890, all of which were weaker than 03A. As a result, its vulnerability was miscalculated by the local population and the disaster management administration.[6] Power supply to numerous residences was lost due to the storms high winds.[7] A microwave tower in Porbandar collapsed, causing widespread disruption in telecommunication.[8] Hundreds of other power transmission towers also fell, causing an estimated loss of Rs 10 billion for the Gujarat Electricity Board.[9] At least 893 people were injured by the storm and over 11,000 animals were killed. Over 162,000 structures were damaged or destroyed throughout the affected area and damages amounted to Rs.\u00a0120\u00a0billion (US$3\u00a0billion).[10] In Kandla, the damages were estimated around \u20b91,855.33 crore (equivalent to \u20b984\u00a0billion or US$1.0\u00a0billion in 2023).[5] Over the next one month, insurance companies had lost approximately Rs.\u00a013\u00a0billion (US$266.5\u00a0million).[9] The remnants of the storm produced heavy rains over Pakistan which electrocuted 12 people.[3] In the wake of the storm, the United States Government provided US$25,000 for rehabilitation of the affected population.[10] The Government of Denmark also contributed $72,992 in funds for relief efforts.[11] The Gujarat government deployed approximately 330 medical teams to the affected areas. Local aid, amounting to Rs 1 billion (US$20.5\u00a0million) was provided to assist victims.[12]",

      "1933 Treasure Coast hurricane": "  The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane[nb 1] was the second-most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season. The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the season, it formed east-northeast of the Leeward Islands on August\u00a031. The tropical storm moved rapidly west-northwestward, steadily intensifying to a hurricane. It acquired peak winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September\u00a03, including Eleuthera and Harbour Island, causing severe damage to crops, buildings, and infrastructure. Winds over 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) affected many islands in its path, especially those that encountered its center, and many wharves were ruined. Subsequently, it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter, Florida, early on September\u00a04 with winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). The hurricane moved across the state, passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating. In Florida, the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations, and numerous trees were prostrated in citrus groves. The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction, and Stuart, Jupiter, and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged. The storm was locally regarded as the most severe on record in 50\u00a0years. Inland, the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain, causing a dam to collapse near Tampa.  The storm caused $3\u00a0million in damage (1933\u00a0USD) after damaging or destroying 6,848\u00a0homes. Unusually, the storm hit Florida less than 24\u00a0hours before another major hurricane bearing 125-mph (205-km/h) winds struck South Texas; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession.[2]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August\u00a027, although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west-northwest. On August\u00a031, a nearby ship reported gale-force winds, which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles. Based on continuity, it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day. Moving quickly to the west-northwest, the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico. Early on September\u00a02, a ship called the Gulfwing reported a barometric pressure of 978\u00a0mb (28.9\u00a0inHg), which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status.[3] After passing north of the Turks and Caicos islands,[4] the hurricane struck Eleuthera and Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September\u00a03, the latter at 11:00\u00a0UTC. A station on the latter island reported a pressure of 27.90\u00a0inHg (945\u00a0mb) during the half-hour-long passage of the eye.[5] Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm, it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h), making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Interpolation suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status, or Category\u00a03 status, on September\u00a02.[3] The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August, which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas. This hurricane instead maintained a general west-northwest track.[4][6] After moving through the northern Bahamas, the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter, Florida, at 05:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a04. A station there reported a pressure of 27.98\u00a0inHg (948\u00a0mb) during a 40-minute period of the eye's passage; this suggested a landfall strength of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h). At the time, the radius of maximum winds was an estimated 15\u00a0nmi (15\u00a0mi, 30\u00a0km), which was smaller than average.[3][7] After landfall, the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state. It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September\u00a05. A few hours later while continuing to the northwest, it made another landfall near Rosewood\u2014a ghost town in Levy County, east of Cedar Key\u2014with winds of about 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h). Turning to the north, the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia, dissipating on September\u00a07 near Augusta.[2]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "On September\u00a02, a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End, Grand Bahama, to Daytona Beach, Florida.[8] While the storm was near peak intensity on September\u00a03, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne, Florida, with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville. Later that day, storm warnings, were issued from Key West to Cedar Key.[4] About 2,500\u00a0people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee.[9] By evening on September\u00a03, high tides sent sea spray over coastal seawalls in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings; structures on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach were said to be a \"solid front\" of plywood.[10] Along the coast, observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land.[11]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "The Bahamas[edit]": "The powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas. Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h).[3][5] Winds reached 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) at Governor's Harbour, 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on Eleuthera, and 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) on the Abaco Islands.[5][12][13] The storm was farther away from Nassau, where winds reached 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h).[3][12] The hurricane damaged a lumber mill on Abaco, washing away a dock. Heavy damage occurred on Harbour Island, including to several roofs, the walls of government buildings, and the water system. The hurricane destroyed four\u00a0churches and 37\u00a0houses, leaving 100\u00a0people homeless. A 1+1\u20442-mile-long (2.4\u00a0km) road on Eleuthera was destroyed. Several islands sustained damage to farms, including the total loss of various fruit trees on Russell Island. Despite Category\u00a04 winds on Spanish Wells, only five houses were destroyed, although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs. Collectively between North Point, James Cistern, and Gregory Town on Eleuthera, the storm destroyed 55\u00a0houses and damaged many others. On Grand Bahama, where a 9-to-12-foot-high (2.7 to 3.7\u00a0m) storm surge was reported, half of the houses were destroyed, as were 13\u00a0boats and two\u00a0planes, and most docks were wrecked.[5]",
      "Florida[edit]": "When the storm moved ashore in Florida, winds reached an estimated 125\u00a0mph (200\u00a0km/h) in Jupiter; these occurred after the eye passed.[4][14] In West Palm Beach, anemometers measured at least 80-mile-per-hour (130\u00a0km/h) winds with gusts to 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h); barometers ranged from 28.64 to 28.78\u00a0inHg (970 to 975\u00a0mb).[15] The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.[16] Winds were not as strong farther from the center; 40-to-45-mile-per-hour (64 to 72\u00a0km/h) winds were observed in Miami to the south, Titusville to the north, and Tampa on the west coast.[3] At Stuart the lowest atmospheric pressure was measured as 28.60\u00a0inHg (969\u00a0mb),[17] while Indiantown, on the edge of the eye, registered 28.25\u00a0inHg (957\u00a0mb).[18] Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80\u00a0to 90\u00a0mph (130\u00a0to 145\u00a0km/h), and pressures dipped to 29.14\u00a0inHg (987\u00a0mb).[19] Inland, winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h).[20] The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at 17.8\u00a0in (450\u00a0mm) in Clermont.[6] Crop damage was worst along the Indian River Lagoon; several farms in Stuart experienced total losses, and statewide, 16% of the citrus crop, or 4\u00a0million boxes, were destroyed.[4] Across southeastern Florida, the hurricane damaged 6,465\u00a0houses and destroyed another 383,[21] causing over $3\u00a0million in damage.[22] One person, an African American farm worker, was killed when his shack blew down in Gomez,[23] a brakeman died after seven\u00a0railcars derailed,[24] and a child was killed by airborne debris.[14]",
      "South Florida[edit]": "At West Palm Beach, the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks.[16] Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course.[25] Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well.[16] Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted.[26] As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929.[16] High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.[16]",
      "Treasure Coast[edit]": "In Martin and St. Lucie counties, the storm was considered among the worst on record. The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations.[27] Most structures in the worst-hit areas received at least minor damage, including the loss of tarpaper roofing and shingles.[28] At Stuart, winds removed or badly damaged three-quarters of the roofs in town. The storm destroyed the third floor of the building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart News, a local newspaper.[14][25]  In Stuart, the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless, up to nearly 10% of the population, which was 5,100\u00a0at the time.[14][29] A major landmark, the multi-story Walter Kitching store, collapsed during the storm. An old laundromat was likewise leveled, a private airport destroyed, and a water tower downed. Apartments and large hotels also incurred significant damage from rainwater.[28] The county jail lost all its walls, but inmates opted to remain inside. In town thousands of coconuts, hurled by strong winds from trees, were salvaged by poor black residents. The St. Lucie River reportedly disgorged fish.[17] Many chicken coops in Stuart were destroyed, and the local chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Indiantown.[14][17] Just to the south, at Olympia, an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach, strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn, a gas station, and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building. Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant.[25][23] A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olympia was partly wrecked; the bridge tender survived by gripping the railing during the storm. Winds leveled his nearby home.[23] According to the Monthly Weather Review, some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia.[4] At Hobe Sound, which experienced the storm's eye for five\u00a0minutes, the hurricane inflicted severe damage and was considered by lifelong residents the worst storm in 50\u00a0years. Landmarks that withstood the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane were felled.[30] Most structures west of the Florida East Coast Railway were severely damaged or wrecked. A filling station was scattered, and the platform at the local railroad station was strewn across the tracks. A railcar from West Palm Beach, blown north 30\u00a0mi (48\u00a0km), crashed into the platform, leaving a mass of wreckage that required several hours' manpower for removal.[31] The storm left many homes in Hobe Sound uninhabitable, forcing crews to tear them down. Winter estates on the island, however, were better built and little damaged,[23] though downed Australian pines, other trees, and electrical wires left coastal roadways essentially impassable. A 10-car garage at the Island Inn was flattened.[31] While Stuart and Hobe Sound sustained significant damage, Port Salerno suffered minimally.[23] At Palm City the storm badly damaged structures and crops. A store sustained damage to such a degree that it was unusable, and a riverfront two-story home was leveled; on the latter's grounds all palm trees were downed. A well-constructed home, one of the sturdiest in Palm City, incurred only superficial damage, however. Most small houses in the area lost their roofs or were shifted on their foundations. The Niagara Fruit Company lost all its outbuildings and sustained severe damage to its main house. Many trees on site and on nearby farms were felled as well. At Tropical Farms most large properties were rendered uninhabitable, while a number of smaller homes were destroyed. Citrus trees, mainly grapefruit and orange, were prostrated, and the St. Lucie River overflowed its banks, submersing several properties.[32] At Sewall's Point mansions were mostly negligibly damaged, except for losses of ornamental vegetation. 40-foot-tall (12\u00a0m) queen palms were felled, along with many tall coconut palms; several of the latter species were also left standing at an incline. Dozens of Australian pines were leveled as well.[33] Inland, at Indiantown, the storm wrecked outbuildings such as sheds, garages, and shacks, but otherwise did little damage to larger structures. The eye passed just north of town, causing a lull over rural land.[18] Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce, the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines.[4] In the latter city, high waves washed out a portion of the causeway.[34] In the 1980s, an elderly resident recalled that the storm was the most severe on record in Fort Pierce.[27]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "High rainfall caused flooding across Florida, notably near Tampa where waters reached 9\u00a0ft (2.7\u00a0m) deep. High rainfall of over 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co. to break 3\u00a0mi (4.8\u00a0km) northeast of Tampa along the Hillsborough River. The break resulted in severe local damage,[14][24] flooding portions of Sulphur Springs. Workers attempted to save the dam with sandbags, and after the break, most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood. Over 50\u00a0homes were flooded, forcing about 150\u00a0people to evacuate.[35] Outside Florida, the storm produced winds of 48 and 51\u00a0mph (77 and 82\u00a0km/h) in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, respectively. In the latter city, the storm spawned a tornado,[3] which caused about $10,000 in property damage.[24] Heavy rainfall occurred along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts, reaching over 12\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm). Light rainfall also extended into North Carolina.[6]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "In the Bahamas after the storm, a boat sailed from Nassau to deliver food and building materials to Eleuthera.[5] After the storm, the National Guard offered shelters for at least 400\u00a0homeless residents in Stuart.[14] Of the 7,900\u00a0families adversely affected by the hurricane, 4,325\u00a0required assistance from the American Red Cross.[21] Farmers in Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15\u00a0days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell.[36] The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.[37]",

The storm killed 7 people total, due to flooding from the cyclone,[1] in the countries of Tunisia, Algeria, Malta, and Italy, where the worst of the effects have been felt, especially on the island of Sicily.[3][4][5] Damage estimates by the Aon Benfield were set at more than $245 million.[1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Around 22 October 2021, an area of organized thunderstorms formed near the Balearic Islands, with the disturbance becoming more organized and developing an area of low pressure around 24 October.[6] On the next day, the low started to develop a low-level circulation center, and moved into the Tyrrhenian Sea. On 28 October, the system organized even further and intensified, which prompted forecast offices in Europe to name the low. Italy's \"Servizio Meteorologico\" named the storm Apollo (which was then adopted by the Free University of Berlin),[7] while Greece named the storm Nearchus.[2] On 29 October 2021, a ship in the Mediterranean Sea passed through Apollo and measured a peak wind speed of 104\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) and a pressure of 999.4\u00a0mb (29.51\u00a0inHg), indicating that Apollo was still strengthening.[8] After Apollo made its closest approach to Sicily during the overnight hours of 29 October, Apollo appeared to have begun to weaken as its convection waned and its low-level circulation became exposed on visible satellite imagery on 30 October 2021.[9][10] On 31 October 2021, Apollo made landfall near Bayda and stayed inland until emerging over the Mediterranean a few hours later.[11] On 2 November 2021, Apollo dissipated inland over Turkey.[12][13]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Heavy rain from the cyclone and its precursor caused heavy rainfall and flooding in Tunisia, Algeria, Southern Italy, and Malta, killing 7 people total.[1][5][14][15] The flooding was especially severe in the provinces of Catania and Siracusa, in Eastern Sicily.[3][4]",
      "Aftermath and naming[edit]": "Some names for the cyclone include the most commonly-used one, Apollo, which was used by Italy, which used it from its naming list for the 2021-22 windstorm season,[16] and was also used by the Free University of Berlin.[7] The agency Meteo Greece named the system Nearchus, after the voyager of the same name.[2]",

      "Hurricane Fiona": "  Hurricane Fiona was a large, powerful, and destructive Category 4 Atlantic hurricane which was the costliest and most intense tropical or post-tropical cyclone to hit Canada on record. It was the sixth named storm, third hurricane and first major hurricane of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season. Fiona developed from a tropical wave that emerged from West Africa, before developing into a tropical depression east of the Leeward Islands on September\u00a014. Though under the influence of moderate to strong wind shear, the system was able to strengthen, becoming Tropical Storm Fiona later that same day. On September\u00a016, Fiona passed over Guadeloupe and entered the Caribbean Sea, where atmospheric conditions improved, and strengthened into a hurricane as it approached Puerto Rico two days later. A few hours afterward, the eye of Fiona made landfall along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico, near Punta Tocon, between the municipalities of Lajas and Cabo Rojo. The hurricane made landfall in the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter, and then strengthened into the first major hurricane of the season. As the storm slowly moved through the Turks and Caicos, it continued to strengthen and reached Category 4 status the following day, while accelerating north. The storm reached peak 1-minute sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (220\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (27.49\u00a0inHg). After passing Bermuda and weakening to Category\u00a03 intensity, Fiona quickly transitioned into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone and struck Nova Scotia with sustained winds of 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) early on September 24. Post-tropical Fiona then quickly weakened as it moved through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and over the southeastern Labrador Peninsula. The remnants then dissipated over the Labrador Sea near the southwest coast of Greenland on September\u00a027. Guadeloupe received near-record rainfall, leaving 40% of the population without water for a few days. Puerto Rico suffered from the worst flooding since Hurricane Maria of 2017, and an island-wide blackout occurred. A third of the territory's population was left without water, and at least 25 people died. In the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos, the islands were pounded by heavy rainfall and strong winds, causing flooding and blackouts. Fiona was the strongest cyclone on record to make landfall in Canada based on atmospheric pressure[3] and was one of the wettest ever recorded in the country as well.",
      "Meteorological history": "Early on September\u00a012, 2022, the NHC began to monitor a tropical wave over the central tropical Atlantic for gradual development, though environmental conditions for development were assessed as only marginally favorable.[4] Even so, shower and thunderstorm activity within the disturbance began to become more concentrated later that same day,[5] then increased and became better organized during the next day.[6] The circulation associated with the system became more defined and persisted overnight and into the morning of September\u00a014, attaining sufficient organization to designated as Tropical Depression Seven later that day.[7] Despite the continued effects of moderate westerly shear and dry mid-level air flow,[8] new satellite imagery indicated the depression had strengthened, thus at 01:45\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, it became Tropical Storm Fiona.[9] The storm passed over Guadeloupe with 50\u00a0mph (45\u00a0kn; 80\u00a0km/h) winds on September\u00a016, as it entered the eastern Caribbean.[10] Early on September\u00a018, the storm strengthened into a hurricane as it approached Puerto Rico.[11] A few hours later, the eye of Fiona made landfall along the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico near Punta Tocon between the municipalities of Lajas and Cabo Rojo at 19:20\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018, with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour (135\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 986\u00a0mbar (29.12\u00a0inHg).[12] The storm emerged over the Mona Passage and strengthened slightly further before making landfall in the Dominican Republic near Boca de Yuma around 07:30\u00a0UTC the next morning, with maximum sustained winds of 80 knots (90\u00a0mph; 150\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 977\u00a0mbar (28.85\u00a0inHg).[13] Fiona weakened slightly over land, but after emerging off the northern coast of the Dominican Republic and back over the Atlantic Ocean, it began to intensify again, reaching Category\u00a02 intensity at 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019.[14] Fiona then reached Category\u00a03 intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC the next morning, becoming the first major hurricane of the season.[15] Gradual strengthening continued and Fiona became a Category\u00a04 hurricane at 06:00\u00a0UTC September\u00a021.[16] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023, Fiona attained a minimum central pressure of 931\u00a0mbar (27.5\u00a0inHg) (its lowest pressure while a tropical cyclone) at 30.8\u00b0N, the lowest such value at this latitude over the North Atlantic Ocean since at least 1979.[17][18] Fiona then weakened slightly, dropping to Category 3 status at 09:00 UTC,[19] but restrengthened back to Category 4 strength six hours later;[20] at that time, with a central pressure of 936\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg) or lower, the storm was also the most intense Category\u00a04 Atlantic hurricane on record at such a northerly latitude.[21] Six hours later, as it began interact with a mid- to upper-level trough, Fiona began to slowly weaken again and accelerated to the north-northeast at 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h),[22] and subsequently became a post-tropical cyclone as it became embedded within the larger-scale trough while still maintaining major hurricane-force winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). Steady weakening continued and by 07:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, the center of Fiona made landfall with estimated winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) on the Canso Peninsula, Nova Scotia, near Whitehead; based on observations from a nearby weather station at Hart Island and the East Chedabucto Bay buoy, the central pressure at the time was estimated to have been 931\u00a0mbar (27.5\u00a0inHg), the lowest measured on record in association with a landfalling post-tropical cyclone in Canada, and a new national record from any storm.[23][24][25] Wind gusts across Nova Scotia recorded figures in excess of 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph), with Arisaig recording a peak of 179\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph).[24] Extremely large waves reached the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia late September 24. Buoy data indicated wave heights of 5 to 8\u00a0m (16 to 26\u00a0ft). The largest offshore waves were near and east of Fiona's path; this was indicated by satellite data and reports from a buoy over Banquereau Bank where waves averaged 12 to 15\u00a0m (39 to 49\u00a0ft) with peak waves as high as 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft).[24] Fiona then moved over Cape Breton Island with hurricane-strength winds and hit Prince Edward Island. It continued to weaken as it moved northward into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.[26] When the NHC issued its final advisory on Fiona at 21:00\u00a0UTC that same day, it was centered about 80 miles (130\u00a0km) northwest of Port aux Basques, Newfoundland, and had maximum sustained winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[27] Fiona would continue to weaken as it moved erratically northward into the northwestern Atlantic before dissipating west of Greenland over Baffin Bay on September 27.",
      "Preparations": "After the naming of Fiona, tropical storm watches were issued for the islands of Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, and Anguilla.[28] These were raised to tropical storm warnings two advisories later with watches extended south to Guadeloupe, St. Barthelemy, and St. Martin.[29] As Fiona moved west, tropical storm watches then warnings were put in place for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Parts of the Dominican Republic also had tropical storm watches put in place.[30][31][32] On September 17, the first hurricane watches were put in place for Puerto Rico and soon after, the Dominican Republic. By 14:00 UTC the same day, the hurricane watch in Puerto Rico was upgraded to a hurricane warning with the watch extended to the U.S. Virgin Islands.[33][34] As a result, Virgin Islands National Park closed.[35] On approach to Atlantic Canada, Fiona's unprecedented strength prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre to warn residents of \"heavy rainfall\" and powerful \"hurricane force winds\". The center also called the event \"severe\".[36] Bob Robichaud, a meteorologist for Environment and Climate Change Canada, said the storm will be one that \"everybody remembers\".[37] The Kejimkujik National Park temporarily closed due to the extratropical cyclone.[38]",
      "Impact": "At least 29 deaths have been confirmed throughout the Caribbean and Canada from Hurricane Fiona as of September 30. The search and rescue team took about two weeks to finish their search of people that were missing.",
      "Guadeloupe": "Guadeloupe received large amounts of rain, at a rate of more than 150\u00a0mm per hour in some places where the rivers washed away dozen of roads and bridges, and one person died when his house was washed away in the floods near the Rivi\u00e8re des P\u00e8res in the district of Basse-Terre. Firefighters carried out 130 interventions and 23 people were rescued. The cyclonic swell reached 2 to 4 metres (6.6 to 13.1\u00a0ft) and the gusts exceeded 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) with a peak of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) at Baie-Mahault and 98\u00a0km/h (61\u00a0mph) at Anse-Bertrand.[39] The storm left over 1.000 homeless and the minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Carenco declared area of natural disaster September 24 for 22 towns.[53]",
      "Puerto Rico": "At least 670 people were rescued from impacted sites following Fiona's deluge.[111] U.S. President Joe Biden approved a disaster declaration for the island, allowing funding for search and rescue, debris removal, and shelter and food among other accommodations for a month.[112] Damage and debris left from Fiona disallowed rescuers and officials from entering affected areas. By September 22, 470 people and 48 pets remained in shelters.[63] Biden's disaster declaration also allowed FEMA to assist survivors in 55 municipalities and for public assistance in all 78 of them. 7 million liters of water, 4 million ready-to-eat meals, more than 215 generators, 100,000 tarps, and more were provided in four warehouses around Puerto Rico.[113] A few days after the hurricane struck, a delegation from United Hatzalah of Israel[114] arrived to provide psychological and emotional stabilization to those affected by the storm in various sections of the island.[115] Working together with local community leaders and organizations including PR4PR, Chabad, and FREMS, the team assisted hundreds of people in the municipalities of Anasco and Loiza providing them with basic medical check ups, and psychological first aid tools to help them cope with the aftermath of the storm.[citation needed] El Yunque National Forest partially re-opened from the storm on October 12.[116]",
      "Dominican Republic": "A few days after the hurricane, New York City mayor Eric Adams visited the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. After the visit, he requested a $3.7 billion supplemental bill for emergency and nutritional aid.[117]",
      "Turks and Caicos": "Fiona's eye passed through the Grand Turks island, severely affecting the telecommunications in the archipelago.[74] At least 40% of the territory was left without electricity, with total blackouts reported in North Caicos, Middle Caicos, South Caicos, Grand Turk and Salt Cay. 30% of Providenciales experienced power outages.[75] Moderate damage and no deaths were reported.[74]",
      "Bermuda": "Passing west of the island, Fiona's large size produced sustained tropical storm-force winds over Bermuda for several hours; L.F. Wade International Airport reported a gust of 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h).[76] Over 80% of the island lost power.[77]",
      "Eastern Canada": "Fiona made landfall near Whitehead, Nova Scotia, on the morning of September\u00a024 as a recently transitioned extratropical cyclone with hurricane-force winds.[88][89][90] Environment Canada assessed Fiona's maximum sustained winds at the time of landfall to be around 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h); these winds would be comparable to a Category\u00a02 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[91] It was the strongest storm in Canadian history as gauged by barometric pressure; a pressure of 932.7\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.54\u00a0inHg) was unofficially measured on Hart Island, setting the all-time low pressure record for any landfalling cyclone on Canadian shores.[91] The pressure was also potentially lower than any other air pressure measurement along the coast of eastern Northern America outside of the United States Gulf Coast states. Other weather stations also documented pressures below the previous record of 940.2\u00a0mbar (27.76\u00a0inHg). A peak wind gust of 111\u00a0mph (179\u00a0km/h) was recorded in Arisaig, Nova Scotia.[92] Peak gusts in other Canadian provinces included 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h) at Wreckhouse, Newfoundland and Labrador, 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h) at East Point, Prince Edward Island, 78\u00a0mph (126\u00a0km/h) on the Magdalen Islands of Quebec, and 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) on Miscou Island in New Brunswick.[91][93] Fiona also generated large waves and destructive storm surge, with the highest waves occurring east of the storm's center. A buoy on the Banquereau Bank registered wave heights as high as 98 feet (30\u00a0m) along with average wave heights of around 40\u201350 feet (12\u201315\u00a0m). The onshore push of storm surge led to record water level heights being set at Escuminac, New Brunswick, and Channel-Port aux Basques.[91] Rainfall totals from Fiona were less than anticipated due to the entrainment of dry air into the cyclone.[93] The heaviest rains fell in eastern Nova Scotia, where totals generally ranged between 100\u2013200\u00a0mm (3.9\u20137.9\u00a0in).[91] Fiona affected the four provinces of Atlantic Canada, as well as Quebec.[94][95][96] The storm caused major flooding in Quebec's Magdalen Islands, southeastern New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, northeastern Nova Scotia, and southern Newfoundland.[97] Thousands of trees were knocked down and uprooted in Nova Scotia from Halifax eastward, as well as most of southeastern New Brunswick, most of P.E.I., and some parts in Newfoundland. Wind gusts of 179\u00a0km/h (111\u00a0mph) were reported in Arisaig, Nova Scotia with a record high water height (before waves) of 2.73 meters (9.0\u00a0ft) in Channel-Port aux Basques, Newfoundland.[98] At least 100 homes were damaged or destroyed in Newfoundland, primarily in Channel-Port aux Basques, with more than 200 people displaced.[99] Fiona left more than 500,000 customers without power, including 80% of all Nova Scotia customers and 95% of Prince Edward Island customers.[100][101] A Port aux Basques woman was killed when her home was destroyed and she was swept into the ocean; another person died of carbon monoxide poisoning while operating an electrical generator in Prince Edward Island.[102][103][104] Another man in Lower Prospect, Nova Scotia was swept out to sea and presumed dead.[45] Teacup Rock, a rock formation and local tourist attraction on the coast near Thunder Cove, Prince Edward Island, was destroyed after Hurricane Fiona struck.[105] Fiona also caused severe erosion to the province's dune system, particularly within Prince Edward Island National Park.[106] On September 25, Deputy Premier of Quebec Genevi\u00e8ve Guilbault flew to the Magdalen Islands to view the storm damage.[107] Insured losses from Fiona in Canada are estimated to be at least CA$800\u00a0million (US$590\u00a0million), with the total damage expected to be significantly higher.[108] This became the costliest weather event in Atlantic Canada history,[109] and the seventh-costliest nationwide (adjusted for inflation).[110]",
      "Aftermath": "",
      "Retirement": "Due to the severe damage and number of deaths the hurricane caused across the Caribbean and in eastern Canada, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Fiona from its rotating name lists in March 2023, and it will never be used again for another Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Farrah, which will first appear on the 2028 season list.[118][119]",

      "Columbus Day storm of 1962": " The Columbus Day storm of 1962 (also known as the big blow of 1962,[2] and originally in Canada as Typhoon Freda) was a Pacific Northwest windstorm that struck the West Coast of Canada and the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States on October 12, 1962. Typhoon Freda was the twenty-eighth tropical depression, the twenty-third tropical storm, and the eighteenth typhoon of the 1962 Pacific typhoon season. Freda originated from a tropical disturbance over the Northwest Pacific on September 28. On October 3, the system strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Freda, before becoming a typhoon later that day, while moving northeastward. The storm quickly intensified, reaching its peak as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon on October 5, with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 948 millibars (28.0\u00a0inHg). Freda maintained its intensity for another day, before beginning to gradually weaken, later on October 6. On October 9, Freda weakened into a tropical storm, before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on the next day. On October 11, Freda turned eastward and accelerated across the North Pacific, before striking the Pacific Northwest on the next day. On October 13, the cyclone made landfall on Washington and Vancouver Island, and then curved northwestward. Afterward, the system moved into Canada and weakened, before being absorbed by another developing storm to the south on October 17. The Columbus Day storm of 1962 is considered to be the benchmark of extratropical wind storms. The storm ranks among the most intense to strike the region since at least 1948, likely since the January 9, 1880 \"Great Gale\" and snowstorm. The storm is a contender for the title of the most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 \"storm of the century\" and the \"1991 Halloween Nor'easter\" (\"the perfect storm\").  The system brought strong winds to the Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada, and was linked to 46\u00a0fatalities in the northwest and Northern California resulting from heavy rains and mudslides.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On the morning of September 28, a tropical disturbance formed south of the island of Eniwetok Atoll. After moving westward and making a large bend around the island, the new system slowly gained strength, and on the morning of October 3, the system became a tropical storm about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) from Wake Island, over the central Pacific Ocean.[3] Now named Freda, the system rapidly intensified as it proceeded northeastward over the open Pacific waters. On that afternoon, Freda intensified into a typhoon, with 1-minute sustained winds of 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). On October 4, the typhoon quickly intensified, reaching its peak of 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h) on the next day, with a minimum central pressure of 948 millibars (27.99\u00a0inHg), making the storm the equivalent of a Category 3 typhoon on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. After stabilizing to the north, Freda maintained its strength through the Pacific, before beginning to weaken slowly on October 6. Making a turn to the northeast, Freda maintained typhoon-status winds for several more days, before weakening into a tropical storm on October 9, as it started experiencing the effects of cold air.[4] Moving northeastward at a steady rate of 16\u00a0mph (26\u00a0km/h), the storm slowly underwent an extratropical transition, becoming extratropical operationally on the morning of October 10, still with winds of 45\u00a0mph (65\u00a0km/h).[4] The system became an extratropical cyclone as it moved into colder waters and interacted with the jet stream. However, post-season analysis concluded that the system continued weakening as it continued northeastward, crossing the 180th meridian later that afternoon, before completing the transition that evening.[5] The extratropical low redeveloped intensely off the coast of Northern California, due to favorable upper-level conditions, producing record rainfall across the San Francisco Bay Area that delayed some games in the 1962 World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the New York Yankees. The low moved northeastward, and then hooked straight north, as it neared southwest Oregon. The storm then raced nearly northward at an average speed of 40 miles per hour (64\u00a0km/h), with the center situated just 50 miles (80\u00a0km) off the Pacific Coast. There was little central pressure change until the cyclone passed the latitude of Astoria, Oregon, at which time the low began to degrade. On October 13, the center passed over Tatoosh Island, Washington, before making landfall on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it weakened rapidly. The cyclone then curved northwestward, before turning back eastward and moving into Canada. As the cyclone moved through Canada, another cyclone formed on its southern periphery, which absorbed the original cyclone by October 17.[6] The extratropical cyclone deepened to a minimum central pressure of at least 960\u00a0hPa (28\u00a0inHg), and perhaps as low as 958\u00a0hPa (28.3\u00a0inHg), a pressure which would be equivalent to a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS). Since the system was an extratropical cyclone, its wind field was neither as compact nor as strong as a tropical cyclone, though its wind field was significantly larger. All-time record-low land-based pressures (up to 1962) included 969.2\u00a0hPa (28.62\u00a0inHg) at Astoria, 970.5\u00a0hPa (28.66\u00a0inHg) at Hoquiam, Washington, and 971.9\u00a0hPa (28.70\u00a0inHg) at North Bend, Oregon. The Astoria and Hoquiam records were broken by a major storm on December 12, 1995 (which measured 966.1\u00a0hPa (28.53\u00a0inHg) at Astoria); however, this event did not generate winds as intense as the Columbus Day Storm of 1962.",
      "Wind speed highlights[edit]": "The peak winds were felt as the storm passed close by on October 12. At Cape Blanco on the southern Oregon coast, an anemometer that lost one of its cups registered wind gusts in excess of 145 miles per hour (233 kilometers per hour); some reports put the peak velocity at 179\u00a0mph (288\u00a0km/h).  The north Oregon coast Mt. Hebo radar station reported winds of 170\u00a0mph (270\u00a0km/h).[8] At the Naselle Radar Station in the Willapa Hills of southwest Washington, a wind gust of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h) was observed.[7] In Salem, Oregon, a wind gust of 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h) was observed.[7] At Corvallis, Oregon, an inland location in the Willamette Valley, one-minute average winds reached 69 miles per hour (111\u00a0km/h), with a gust to 127\u00a0mph (204\u00a0km/h), before the station was abandoned due to \"power failure and instruments demolished\". Observations at the weather station resumed the next day.[7] About 80 miles (130\u00a0km) to the north, at Portland, Oregon's major metropolitan area, measured wind gusts reached 116\u00a0mph (187\u00a0km/h) at the Morrison Street Bridge in downtown Portland. In Vancouver, Washington around 9 miles north of downtown Portland, a peak gust of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) was observed at Pearson Field. Many anemometers, official and unofficial, within the heavily stricken area of northwestern Oregon and southwest Washington were damaged or destroyed before winds attained maximum velocity. For example, the wind gauge atop the downtown Portland studios of KGW radio and TV recorded two gusts of 93\u00a0mph (150\u00a0km/h), just before flying debris knocked the gauge off-line[9] shortly after 5 p.m. For the Willamette Valley, the lowest peak gust officially measured was 86\u00a0mph (138\u00a0km/h) at Eugene. This value, however, is higher than the maximum peak gust generated by any other Willamette Valley windstorm in the 1948\u20132010 period. In the interior of western Washington, officially measured wind gusts included 78 miles per hour (126\u00a0km/h) at Olympia, 88\u00a0mph (142\u00a0km/h) at McChord Air Force Base, 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) at Renton at 64 feet (20\u00a0m) and 98\u00a0mph (158\u00a0km/h) at Bellingham. In the city of Seattle, a peak wind speed of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) was recorded; this suggests gusts of at least 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). Damaging winds reached as far inland as Spokane. Wind gusts of 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h), the National Weather Service minimum for \"High Wind Criteria,\" or higher were reported from San Francisco, to Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Impact[edit]": "At least 46 fatalities were attributed to this storm, more than for any other Pacific Northwest weather event.[10] Injuries went into the hundreds. In terms of natural disaster-related fatalities for the 20th century, only Oregon's Heppner Flood of 1903 (247 deaths), Washington's Wellington avalanche of 1910 (96 deaths), the Great Fire of 1910 (87 deaths), and Eruption of Mount St. Helens of 1980 (57 deaths) caused more. For Pacific Northwest windstorms in the 20th century, the runner up was the infamous October 21, 1934, gale, which caused 22 fatalities, mostly in Washington. In less than 12\u00a0hours, more than 11 billion board feet (26,000,000 m3) of timber was blown down in northern California, Oregon and Washington combined; some estimates put it at 15 billion board feet (35,000,000 m3). This exceeded the annual timber harvest for Oregon and Washington at the time. This value is above any blowdown measured for East Coast storms, including hurricanes; even the often-cited 1938 New England hurricane, which toppled 2.65 billion board feet (6,300,000 m3), falls short by nearly an order of magnitude. Estimates put the dollar damage at approximately $230\u00a0million to $280\u00a0million for California, Oregon, and Washington combined. Those figures in 1962 US dollars translate to $1.8 to $2.2 billion in 2014 US dollars. Oregon's share exceeded $200\u00a0million in 1962 US dollars. This is comparable to land-falling hurricanes that occurred within the same time frame (for example, Audrey, Donna, and Carla from 1957 to 1961).[11] The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. (now MetLife) named the Columbus Day Storm the nation's worst natural disaster of 1962.[12]",
      "California[edit]": "In Central and Northern California, all-time record rains associated with the atmospheric river along the cold front caused major flooding and mudslides, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. Oakland set an all time calendar day record with 4.52 inches (115\u00a0mm) of rain on the 13th, as did Sacramento with 3.77 inches (96\u00a0mm).  More than 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) of rainfall were recorded in the Bay area.[13] Heavy rain forced Game 6 of the 1962 World Series at San Francisco's Candlestick Park to be postponed from its originally scheduled date of October 11 to Monday, October 15.",
      "Oregon[edit]": "In the Willamette Valley, it is said the undamaged home was the exception. Livestock suffered greatly due to the barn failures: the animals were crushed under the weight of the collapsed structures, a story that was repeated many times throughout the afflicted region. At the north end of the Valley, two 500-foot (150\u00a0m) high voltage transmission towers were toppled. Radio and TV broadcasting were affected in the Portland area. KGW-TV lost its tower at Skyline and replaced the temporary tower with a new one on January 28, 1963. KOIN radio lost one of two AM towers at Sylvan. KPOJ-AM/-FM lost much of its transmitting equipment, plus one of two towers was left partially standing at Mount Scott. KPOJ-FM was so badly damaged it wouldn't return to the air until February 9, 1963. KWJJ-AM lost one of its towers and a portion of its transmitter building at Smith Lake. KISN-AM also lost a tower at Smith Lake. Seven-month-old TV station KATU did not receive any damage at its Livingston Mountain site, 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) north of Camas, Washington. However, KATU didn't have a generator and power was cut off. The heavy-duty design of the radio towers on Portland's West Hills today, with extensive and robust guy cables, is a direct result of the lessons learned from the 1962 catastrophe. For northwest Oregon, the entire power distribution system had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Some locations did not have power restored for several weeks.[10] This storm became a lasting memory for local power distributors.  Indeed, a number of high wind related studies appeared in the years after the storm in an attempt to assess the return frequency of such potentially damaging winds. The state capitol grounds at Salem, and the state's college campuses, resembled battlefields with heavy losses of trees. The Campbell Hall tower at Oregon College of Education (now Western Oregon University) in Monmouth crashed to the ground,[14] an event recorded by student photographer Wes Luchau in the most prominent picture-symbol of the storm. East of Salem, the wind destroyed a historic barn that served as a clandestine meeting place by pro-slavery Democratic members of the state Legislature in 1860.[citation needed] The Oregon State Beavers\u2013Washington Huskies college football game went on as scheduled Saturday, October 13 in Portland, in a heavily damaged Multnomah Stadium. Much of the roof was damaged and seats damaged by falling debris were replaced by portable chairs.[15] Crews cleared debris from the grandstand and playing field right up to kickoff.[15] Most of the electricity, including the scoreboard and clock, was still out and players dressed by candlelight in the locker rooms.[16] The Huskies came from behind to beat the Beavers 14\u201313, despite a strong performance by quarterback Terry Baker, who would win the Heisman Trophy later that year.[16][17]",
      "British Columbia[edit]": "The storm weakened as it traveled north into British Columbia, with peak gusts measured at 90 miles per hour (140\u00a0km/h).[18] Five people in British Columbia were killed in the storm,[19] and the area suffered $80 million in damages.[20] Stanley Park lost 3,000 trees. A Victoria resident described it as \"Just general devastation everywhere you went. There were trees breaking off and flying across the roads. \"Wind was just blowing the rain horizontal and trees were weaving all over the place. You didn't know if you were going to get hit or not.\"[21] At Victoria airport, a Martin Mars waterbomber (\"Caroline Mars\") was hurled 200 yards (180\u00a0m) and irreparably damaged.[22]",

      "Hurricane Humberto (2019)": "Hurricane Humberto was a large and powerful tropical cyclone that caused extensive wind damage in Bermuda during September\u00a02019. It was the eighth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane \u2013 Category 3 or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale \u2013 of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. Humberto formed on September\u00a013 from the prolonged interaction of a tropical wave and an upper-level trough, then paralleled the eastern coastline of Florida through September\u00a016 before turning sharply northeastward. A generally favorable environment allowed Humberto to become a hurricane that day, and the storm further strengthened to reach peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on September\u00a018. After its center passed within 65 miles (105\u00a0km) of Bermuda around 00:00 UTC on September 19, the system encountered stronger wind shear and drier air. Stripped of its deep thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned to a potent extratropical cyclone early on September\u00a020. Forming on the heels of Hurricane Dorian two weeks prior, Humberto proved far less destructive throughout the Bahamas, producing only some squally weather. The eastern coastline of Florida saw tropical storm-force wind gusts, choppy seas, and light rainfall. Rip currents caused one death in Florida and another in North Carolina. In Bermuda, coastal flooding and rainfall were limited by low astronomical tides and Humberto's quick forward motion. However, peak surface winds of around 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts, caused widespread damage to trees, roofs, crops, and power lines, most notably on the western end of the island chain. Some 90% of Bermuda's banana crop was lost. As many as 600 buildings suffered roof damage, while 27,900 customers were left without power; though most of the network was quickly repaired, some electric outages persisted for at least 10 days. L.F. Wade International Airport and the Bermuda Weather Service campus both suffered property damage. In total, the hurricane wrought over $25\u00a0million in damage throughout Bermuda. Hurricane Jerry to the south briefly posed a threat to the territory as cleanup from Humberto got underway, but it ultimately dissipated with no ill-effects.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of Hurricane Humberto trace back to a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa on August\u00a027, 2019. Accompanied by little convective activity, the disturbance moved westward across the Atlantic for several days. On September\u00a04, the wave encountered a mid- to upper-level trough of low pressure several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Resistance from the trough split the wave in two; the southern portion proceeded through the Windward Islands, while the northern portion of the wave moved toward the northwest in tandem with the trough. As the trough became negatively tilted, or oriented northwest-to-southeast, strengthening anticyclonic flow on its east side promoted periods of enhanced convection close to the tropical wave. These convective bursts, largely driven by diurnal cycles, led to the development of a broad surface low on the morning of September\u00a012 as the disturbance turned north-northwest through the Turks and Caicos Islands.[1] At 21:00\u00a0UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the disturbance to a potential tropical cyclone, given that it posed a threat to land but its circulation did not yet meet the organization necessary to designate a tropical cyclone. This facilitated the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Bahamas.[2] Observations from ships and nearby islands early on September\u00a013 indicated that the low-level center had become better defined, and satellite imagery depicted the formation of a narrow curved spiral band in the disturbance's northeastern quadrant. Based on this evidence, the NHC estimated that a tropical depression formed around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September 13, approximately 85 miles (137\u00a0km) east of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. It intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto six hours later.[1] The newly formed storm slowly turned northwestward as it tracked toward a weakness in the Azores High.[1] Dry air and wind shear imparted by the trough that contributed to Humberto's genesis now inhibited organization, and the tropical storm more closely resembled a subtropical cyclone rather than a fully tropical one during September\u00a014.[3] As the day progressed, reconnaissance missions found a more aligned storm center, an indication that upper-level winds were beginning to relent. Banding features flourished, upper-level outflow expanded, and a formative inner core became apparent.[4] By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016, Humberto intensified into the season's third hurricane as it temporarily stalled about 175 miles (282\u00a0km) east-northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. From that point, a broad upper-level trough over the East Coast of the United States steered the cyclone sharply toward the northeast.[1] While moving over sea surface temperatures of around 84\u00b0F (29\u00b0C),[5] Humberto intensified during the next day.[1] The hurricane developed a large eye, 35\u201340 miles (56\u201364\u00a0km) in diameter, surrounded by very cold cloud tops, a hallmark of intense thunderstorm activity. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on the evening of September\u00a017 was used as the basis for upgrading Humberto to a Category\u00a03 hurricane around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018.[1][6] This upgrade was applied despite a broad and asymmetric wind field that was most expansive in the southern semicircle.[7] As Humberto passed about 65 miles (105\u00a0km) northwest of Bermuda around 00:00 UTC on September 19, it reached maximum sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h). Some satellite intensity estimates supported Category\u00a04 status, and a dropsonde in the southern eyewall measured winds aloft of 159\u00a0mph (256\u00a0km/h), in addition to surface winds of 131\u00a0mph (211\u00a0km/h). However, these values were recorded at two-second intervals and, consequently, were not representative of sustained winds. Additionally, weather radar imagery from Bermuda indicated a quickly eroding eyewall. Therefore, the strongest winds were likely the result of extratropical processes producing a wind maximum akin to a sting jet, which would not be indicative of Humberto's true strength as a tropical cyclone.[1] As Humberto accelerated ahead of the encroaching upper-level trough to its west, it encountered even stronger upper-level winds and drier air that together triggered a weakening trend. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020, the system had become devoid of organized deep convection, marking its transition to an extratropical cyclone while located 575 miles (925\u00a0km) south-southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The post-tropical cyclone continued to produce a large area of gale-force winds until it merged with an even larger extratropical low around 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a020.[1]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Immediately upon the designation of a potential tropical cyclone, tropical storm warnings were issued for the northwestern Bahamas, except Andros Island.[8] At 03:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, a tropical storm watch was issued for the east coast of the Florida Peninsula between Jupiter Inlet and the Volusia\u2013Brevard County line. After an expansion northward to include more of the Florida coastline, the watch was canceled early the next day.[1] A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda at 21:00 UTC on September\u00a016 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning 24 hours later. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 06:00 UTC on September\u00a019, after the storm's departure.[1] Changes in the hurricane's structure as it approached the territory posed some forecasting challenges, especially concerning the arrival time and magnitude of damaging winds.[9] Ahead of the storm, eight cruise ships were diverted away from Bermuda.[10][11] As early as September\u00a016, L.F. Wade International Airport officials requested that vehicles be moved out of the flood-prone long-term parking area.[12] As conditions deteriorated, the airport closed at 19:00\u00a0UTC on September 18,[9] resulting in the cancellation of twelve commercial flights.[11] Aircraft were also evacuated from the airport during the closure.[13] \"The Causeway\", a route connecting the airport to the territory's population centers, was closed as a precautionary measure shortly after a public curfew took effect at 21:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018.[10][13] Ferry services were suspended at the same time, while buses stopped running in the late afternoon.[14] The government opened its only official hurricane shelter in the Cedarbridge Academy. It was staffed by 30 people from various agencies and provided accommodation for up to 100 residents. Individuals who lived on boats or who felt unsafe in their homes were encouraged to take advantage of the facility. Ultimately, nearly 50 people sought refuge there.[15][13] In an effort to communicate storm dangers to the public, Bermuda's government held a public press conference, activated the Emergency Measures Organisation's emergency broadcast radio station, and sent updates to users of a new official mobile app called Tree Frog,[9][14] introduced just months prior.[16] Governor John Rankin placed 120 members of the Royal Bermuda Regiment on standby,[15] and ambulances and Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews were pre-positioned in strategic locations across the island.[15] Schools, businesses, and governmental offices were closed at 16:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018.[14][15] The Bermuda Stock Exchange was also closed on September\u00a018 and 19.[17] Many boat owners removed their vessels from marinas to secure them on land.[18]",
      "Impacts[edit]": "",
      "The Bahamas[edit]": "Devastated by Hurricane Dorian earlier in the month,[19] the Bahamas were spared significant compounding effects from Tropical Storm Humberto. Grand Bahama International Airport in the northwestern part of the country reported ten-minute sustained winds of just 29\u00a0mph (47\u00a0km/h) as the storm passed to the east, and rainfall totals were light.[1] Humberto's proximity to the disaster area caused small airfields being used in the distribution of emergency supplies to be closed briefly.[20]",
      "United States[edit]": "Rip currents produced by Humberto affected the East Coast of the United States for several days. Conditions were particularly treacherous in northeastern Florida, where strong onshore winds and resulting choppy seas made ocean rescues difficult.[21] In St. Johns County, 21 bathers were rescued from rough seas on September\u00a014 and 15.[1] One rip current victim in the county was found dead after a two-day search, while another was hospitalized in critical condition.[21][22] In Duval County, wind gusts on the periphery of Humberto reached 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h).[23] Florida's eastern coastline also experienced a minor 1 to 1.5\u00a0ft (0.30 to 0.46\u00a0m) storm surge and light rainfall.[1] Farther north, in Topsail Beach, North Carolina, a 62-year-old man drowned after wading into shallow water and getting caught in a rip current.[24] As the storm grew in strength and size, powerful swells propagated southward to the northern coast of Puerto Rico. In addition to coastal flooding, extensive beach erosion damaged some waterfront structures in Espinar, Agunda.[25]",
      "Bermuda[edit]": "Powerful westerly winds were the most severe aspect of the hurricane in Bermuda.[1] The highest wind speeds occurred during a relatively brief period between 23:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a018 and 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a019, coinciding with the closest approach of Humberto's center.[10] At the height of the storm, rapid fluctuations in air pressure and temperature were observed concurrently with highly turbulent wind patterns.[9] Though unconfirmed, localized tornadic activity in Humberto's right-front quadrant may have been responsible for instances of isolated damage hours before hurricane-force winds spread across the islands.[9] The quick-moving system was accompanied by only 1.57\u00a0in (40\u00a0mm) of rain,[1] insufficient to wash away foliage-burning salt residue.[26][27] Peak storm surge values were under 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m),[1] and low astronomical tides prevented any significant coastal flooding.[28] The lowest air pressure recorded in Bermuda was 970.4\u00a0mbar (28.66\u00a0inHg), and the highest waves in the seas off the territory's northern coast were analyzed near 42\u00a0ft (13\u00a0m).[9] Analysis of observations from a buoy located 9\u00a0mi (14\u00a0km) off the northwestern coast indicated that parts of Bermuda experienced sustained winds near Category\u00a03 intensity. The instrument recorded ten-minute average winds of 94\u00a0mph (151\u00a0km/h) gusting to 130\u00a0mph (210\u00a0km/h), at an elevation of 20\u00a0ft (6.1\u00a0m). Adjusting for standard elevation and then converting to a one-minute average yields estimated maximum sustained winds of about 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h).[1][9] On Pearl Island, one-minute sustained winds reached 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h), punctuated by gusts as high as 123\u00a0mph (198\u00a0km/h). L.F. Wade International Airport recorded ten-minute average sustained winds of 82\u00a0mph (132\u00a0km/h) and a gust of 116\u00a0mph (187\u00a0km/h). Elevated stations registered even more powerful winds; at 290\u00a0ft (88\u00a0m) above sea level, the Maritime Operations Centre on St. George's Island measured gusts to 144\u00a0mph (232\u00a0km/h).[1] A private anemometer on the roof of the historical Commissioner's House (part of the National Museum of Bermuda) recorded an extreme wind gust of 192\u00a0mph (309\u00a0km/h), but both the National Hurricane Center and Bermuda Weather Service believe this value to have been artificially inflated by the flow of air over the building.[1][9] These intense winds caused extensive damage, particularly to trees, roofs, and power lines; the worst effects were concentrated in western areas.[1][9] An estimated 500\u2013600 buildings sustained roof damage,[29][30] among them being the Somerset Police Station and an African Methodist Episcopal Church in Sandys Parish.[9][31] This corresponds with the 600 storm-related insurance claims received by three local firms by September 24.[32] Humberto left more than 27,900 electricity customers, around 80% of the territory, without power.[1][10] Many farmers suffered significant losses of fruit and vegetable crops; in particular, 90% of the banana crop was destroyed, requiring an estimated 18 months to recover. This worsened an ongoing shortage of bananas caused by pest insect infestations in imports of the fruit.[33][34] Live plants, including poinsettias and vegetable seedlings, died in conjunction with the destruction of nursery greenhouses.[33] At the airport, security fences and a jet bridge were badly damaged. In the Royal Naval Dockyard, a shipping container blew into the water and presumably sank. A man attempting to ride out the storm on his yacht was briefly imperiled when the vessel broke free from its moorings and eventually wrecked on an island in the Great Sound.[9] Off the northern shore, the wreck of the paddle steamer Montana, a popular dive site, was heavily damaged.[35] The Bermuda Weather Service campus suffered the loss of a satellite dish, antennas, and the weather balloon launching platform, which was blown off its foundation.[9] The agency also lost communication with its Doppler weather radar system near the height of the storm.[10] No major damage was reported in the capital city of Hamilton, though some city parks were closed to the public due to unsafe conditions.[15] The Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service responded to numerous calls for minor fires and other incidents.[15] In total, Humberto caused more than $25 million in damage to Bermuda.[1] Despite the severity of the storm and breadth of damage, no deaths or serious injuries were attributed to the hurricane in the territory.[10]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "In the wake of the hurricane, fallen or low-hanging trees and power lines left some Bermuda roads impassable, so officials advised residents to remain indoors.[36] From the early morning hours on September\u00a019, the Royal Bermuda Regiment assisted government agencies in removing debris from roads.[9] To accommodate the influx of horticultural debris, the Marsh Folly Composting Facility waived its gate fee for disposal of vegetation.[15] The Causeway was reopened to traffic around midday on September\u00a019 following assessments by structural engineers.[13] L.F. Wade International Airport reopened around the same time once repairs to the damaged fencing had been rushed to completion.[9] Government offices, businesses, and most ferry routes resumed normal operations on September\u00a020, while public schools remained closed for an additional day while building evaluations were underway. As BELCO crews repaired the electricity infrastructure, the number of power outages fell to 10,000 by the morning of September\u00a021 and to 1,000 on September\u00a026.[15] The company, which is Bermuda's only electricity supplier, received help from retired employees and mutual aid from another utility company based in the United States.[37] Restoration was temporarily slowed by several utility pole fires caused by salt corrosion.[38] A small number of outages persisted 10 days after the storm.[39] Despite swift cleanup in most locations, a few small streets and parts of the Bermuda Railway Trail remained blocked for several weeks.[9] Immediately after the hurricane, damaged structures were temporarily protected by tarps.[9] Bermuda's Department of Planning relaxed its requirements for building permits to fix certain types of storm-related damage.[40] As a consequence of an ongoing slate tile shortage caused by the inability of local quarries to meet demand, permanent roof repairs were delayed for many residents.[29] With intensifying Hurricane Jerry to the south also considered a potential threat, preparedness measures resumed almost immediately after Humberto's passage. However, Jerry degenerated into a remnant low-pressure system before reaching Bermuda, resulting in only a brief period of inclement weather.[9][41] Premier of the British Virgin Islands Andrew Fahie expressed that his government was prepared to help Bermuda cope with the effects of hurricanes Humberto and Jerry.[15][42]",

      "Tropical Storm Kirk (2018)": " Tropical Storm Kirk was the second lowest-latitude tropical storm on record in the Atlantic basin. The eleventh named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Kirk originated from a tropical wave that left Africa on September\u00a020 and organized into a tropical depression two days later. The system intensified into Tropical Storm Kirk early on September\u00a022 but quickly degenerated into a tropical wave again early the next day. A reduction in the disturbance's forward speed allowed it to regain tropical storm intensity on September\u00a026. Kirk reached maximum sustained winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) that morning before increasing westerly wind shear caused the cyclone to steadily weaken. The storm made landfall on Saint Lucia with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) before continuing into the Caribbean Sea. Kirk degenerated to a tropical wave again on September\u00a028, and its remnants continued westward, contributing to the formation of Hurricane Michael ten days later. Kirk passed narrowly north of Barbados, where tropical storm-force winds cut power to multiple neighborhoods and caused property damage at the official residence of the Governor-General. Rainfall in excess of 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) flooded structures and vehicles, prompting 11 emergency water rescues. In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, rough seas caused coastal flooding and led to the presumed deaths of two fishermen after they ventured out during the storm. On Saint Lucia, strong winds destroyed two buildings; additional structures, including schools and the anemometer at the Hewanorra International Airport, sustained damage. About 2,000 chickens on a poultry farm were killed following the collapse of their pens, and about 80\u201390% of the island's banana crop was left in ruin. The combination of winds and landslides prompted widespread power outages. Lesser impacts were felt on Martinique, where winds damaged trees and cut power to about 3,000 homes.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A low-latitude tropical wave departed the western coast of Africa late on September\u00a020 and moved rapidly west-northwest. After two days of sporadic convective development, it acquired sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) around 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022 to the south of Cabo Verde. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kirk at 8.1\u00b0N, representing the second lowest-latitude tropical storm on record in the Atlantic; only the third storm of the 1902 hurricane season formed farther south. A subtropical ridge to the north of the newly formed cyclone expanded westward, directing the system in the same direction. Kirk became less organized over the next day as a large band of convection, similar to an outflow boundary, propagated away from the center into the northwestern quadrant. This cloud pattern suggested the entrainment of mid-level dry air. The hostile environment caused Kirk to degenerate into a tropical wave by 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a023.[1] Even after degeneration, the storm's remnants continued to produce a large area of showers and thunderstorms, along with gale-force winds in the northern quadrant.[2] By September\u00a026, the forward motion of the remnants slowed, allowing convection to coalesce about a new well-defined center. The NHC accordingly re-initiated Kirk as a tropical storm around 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026 about 520\u00a0miles (835\u00a0km) east-southeast of Barbados. By the morning hours, Kirk's presentation had evolved to feature a strong central dense overcast with few banding features.[3] Satellite intensity estimates were used to assign a peak intensity of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) at 12:00\u00a0UTC through 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026. Thereafter, the cyclone's presentation morphed into a comma-shaped appearance, with the center at times partially exposed on the western edge of this convection due to increasing westerly wind shear.[4] Kirk temporarily moved west-northwest, passing just north of Barbados, before banking west-southwest under the dominant steering regime of a ridge in the western Atlantic. It struck Saint Lucia as a 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) tropical storm around 00:30\u00a0UTC on September\u00a030 and entered the Caribbean, where the storm resumed a west-northwest course while continuing to lose strength. By 00:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a029, after a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to locate a well-defined and closed center, the NHC downgraded Kirk to a tropical wave again while it was positioned a few hundred miles south of the United States Virgin Islands.[1] The remnants continued into the western Caribbean, where they were absorbed by a large area of disturbed weather by October\u00a02 and contributed to the formation of Hurricane Michael.[5]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "At 09:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a026, tropical storm warnings were raised for Barbados and Saint Lucia, accompanied by tropical storm watches for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Three hours later, additional tropical storm warnings were issued for Dominica, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. At 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a028, all tropical storm warnings were discontinued; three hours later, all watches were discontinued as well.[1] In advance of the storm system, LIAT, Caribbean Airlines, and Air Antilles canceled or rescheduled numerous flights between Caribbean destinations.[6][7][8] Schools were closed on September 27 and 28 in Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe.[9][10][11][12][13] In Dominica, all 113 hurricane shelters were opened from September 26\u201328, and businesses were closed on September 27. Water service was temporarily suspended there as a precaution.[11]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Barbados[edit]": "Kirk produced sustained winds of 40\u00a0mph (64\u00a0km/h), gusting to 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h), on Barbados as it passed within 40 miles (64\u00a0km) of the island.[1] Rainfall in excess of 10\u00a0in (250\u00a0mm) caused extensive flooding of streets and homes, peaking on the night of September 27\u201328 on the back end of the storm system.[14] In some parts of Christ Church, floodwaters rose to 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m) in depth,[15] forcing some motorists to abandon their cars.[14][16] In total, 11 individuals in Saint Philip, Christ Church, and Bridgetown required emergency water rescue by the Barbados Defence Force.[17][18] The Barbados Light and Power Company reported power cuts in multiple neighborhoods.[19] Kirk also damaged a stone wall on the property of the Government House.[18] About 40 of the 110 buses owned by Barbados Transport Board were removed from service to allow for repairs of water-related damage incurred while driving through flooded streets.[20] This contributed to long delays for commuters in the following days.[21] A stretch of beach on the south coast was closed until the evening of October 1 so the sluice gate that regulates the Graeme Hall Swamp could be opened to release excess rainwater.[22] In the immediate aftermath of the flooding, Prime Minister Mia Mottley toured the hardest-hit communities with a team of government officials to assess the situation.[23] On October 19, the government of Barbados received an insurance payout of about Bds$11.6 million (US$5.8 million) from CCRIF SPC to cover flood damage.[24][25]",
      "Windward Islands[edit]": "Heavy rainfall and resultant river flooding also affected northeastern Saint Vincent, with precipitation totals exceeding 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm). Coastal flooding due to high surf forced three families to evacuate their homes in New Sandy Bay Village and seek shelter in a public school.[11][26] Two fishermen disappeared and were presumed dead after they ignored weather advisories set out from Canouan during the storm.[26] Strong winds, sustained at 46\u00a0mph (74\u00a0km/h) and gusting to 62\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h),[1] brought down trees and power lines on Saint Lucia, disrupting power and communications services to hundreds of homes.[11][27] Some additional power outages were caused by minor landslides.[28] Electric service was fully restored by late on September 30, after crews completed repairs that included replacing broken utility poles.[29] Several buildings were damaged and at least two were destroyed;[11] schools sustained an estimated EC$1.2 million (US$440,000) in damage. The strong winds also destroyed an anemometer at Hewanorra International Airport.[30] Following the storm, the Saint Lucia Red Cross provided blankets, tarpaulins, and other emergence supplies to households impacted by Kirk.[31] Agricultural interests took a hard hit, particularly in northern parts of the island;[11] many banana fields were ravaged, leading to an 80\u201390% loss of that crop on the island.[30][32] In Babonneau, some 2,000 chickens on a poultry farm were killed when their pens collapsed.[33] In some cases, farmers were not covered under their insurance plans because Kirk fell just below intensity thresholds stipulated for tropical cyclone compensation.[34] Taiwan's International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) contributed EC$1.4 million (US$518,000) in relief funds to be distributed among 108 farmers on Saint Lucia.[34] This donation marked the beginning of the Banana Productivity Improvement Project, a joint program between the ICDF and the Saint Lucia government to support and educate farmers.[35] For instance, it was observed that banana farms shielded by windbreaks fared much better during Tropical Storm Kirk than exposed fields, so with additional ICDF funding, thousands of mango trees were planted as barriers against future wind storms, and growers were counseled on how to care for the trees.[36] Gusty winds extended northward to Martinique; weather stations at standard 33-foot (10\u00a0m) elevation recorded sustained winds of 41\u00a0mph (66\u00a0km/h), gusting to 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h). One station at higher elevation observed a peak gust to 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h).[1] The winds damaged trees and cut power to 3,000 homes, mostly in Le Robert, Sainte-Marie, Gros-Morne, and Le Morne-Vert communes, and the capital city of Fort-de-France.[37] In Saint-Esprit, a sports complex sustained roof damage that required two days of expedited work to repair.[38] Some residents of Le Pr\u00eacheur had to flee a dangerous lahar triggered by heavy rains.[39] During his four-day tour of the French West Indies, President of France Emmanuel Macron canceled a planned visit to Fort-de-France in response to the storm.[40] Guadeloupe experienced lighter winds but more significant rainfall than Martinique, with precipitation totals reaching 6.81\u00a0in (173\u00a0mm) at Petit-Bourg.[41]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "After Kirk dissipated, its remnants interacted with a trough of low pressure to produce showers and thunderstorms across Jamaica that prompted the dissemination of flash flood watches.[42]",

      "Tropical Storm Josephine (1996)": " Tropical Storm Josephine was an unusual Atlantic tropical storm that moved from west to east across the Gulf of Mexico in October 1996. It formed on October\u00a04 as a tropical depression from the remnants of a cold front. Early in its duration, the system interacted with a ridge over the central United States, which produced strong winds and high tides along the Texas coast. The outer rainbands caused flooding rainfall in southern Texas, and in Louisiana, high tides flooded roads and stranded residents on Grand Isle. Moving generally to the east due to a trough, the depression intensified into a tropical storm on October\u00a06, and the next day reached peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) while approaching the west coast of Florida. Josephine made landfall in Taylor County near peak intensity early on October\u00a08, and soon after became extratropical. While moving ashore, the storm produced a high storm surge reaching 9.3\u00a0ft (2.8\u00a0m) in Suwannee. High tides flooded about 3,600\u00a0houses along the west coast. Josephine also produced heavy rainfall, which flooded hundreds of homes, and high winds, which left 400,000\u00a0people without power. The storm also spawned at least 16\u00a0tornadoes, one of which damaged 130\u00a0homes. The extratropical remnants of Josephine moved along the eastern coast of the United States, producing wind gusts as strong as 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h) in St. Mary's County and in Ocean City, Maryland. The winds caused widespread power outages, including 26,000 in Virginia and 31,000 in New Jersey. Heavy rainfall flooded low-lying areas and rivers along the storm's path, including in North Carolina which had previously been affected by hurricanes Bertha and Fran earlier in the year. In the southeastern United States, the storm contributed to dozens of traffic accidents, which killed a person each in Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Damage throughout the United States totaled about $130\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD). Josephine later moved offshore, and after passing southeast of Cape Cod, moved through Atlantic Canada with moderate rainfall and gusty winds. The storm later restrengthened in the northern Atlantic Ocean before merging with another extratropical storm near Iceland on October\u00a016.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In late September 1996, a cold front stalled over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, producing an area of convection. The thunderstorms were possibly related to the same tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Hernan in the eastern Pacific Ocean. A low pressure area formed in the Bay of Campeche by October\u00a02, although initially upper-level conditions did not favor tropical cyclogenesis. The convection became more persistent on October\u00a03 and gradually became better organized. On October\u00a04, classifications based on the Dvorak technique began, and later that day the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system. Based on the data from the flight, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Ten formed at 1800\u00a0UTC that day off the northeast coast of Mexico. During its formative stages, the depression interacted with a ridge near the Great Lakes to produce strong winds across the Gulf Coast of the United States. With weak steering currents, the depression moved slowly to the northeast, and initially, wind shear prevented further organization. On October\u00a06, a strong trough caused the system to accelerate to the east-northeast.[1] The storm's west to east motion across the Gulf of Mexico was unusual although not unprecedented.[2] On October\u00a06, the banding features became better defined, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Josephine. Further intensification followed, and Josephine attained peak winds of about 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a07. This was based on flight-level winds of 85\u00a0mph (137\u00a0km/h), and while near peak intensity, the storm developed a partial eyewall. Josephine accelerated to the northeast while maintaining peak winds, and it made landfall in Taylor County, Florida at 0330\u00a0UTC on October\u00a08. By that time, Josephine was losing tropical characteristics, and shortly thereafter the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it moved over Georgia. The remnants continued to accelerate to the northeast, having weakened quickly to winds of 50\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h). It moved along the East Coast of the United States, emerging from North Carolina into the western Atlantic, and later crossed Atlantic Canada. On October\u00a012, the remnants of Josephine turned to the north and later to the northwest within the general flow of the north Atlantic Ocean. The next day, the storm strengthened to again reach its peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). On October\u00a016, the storm merged with another extratropical storm near Iceland.[1]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "About 19\u00a0hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a tropical storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by a tropical storm watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina.[1] Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000\u00a0people stayed in shelters.[3][4] Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state.[5] Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed a search for the wreck of TWA Flight 800.[6] Game one of the 1996 World Series was postponed by one day due to the storm.[7] While Josephine was forming, it produced high tides of 3 to 4\u00a0ft (0.91 to 1.22\u00a0m) above normal that flooded coastal regions and eroded beaches along the Texas coast. Coastal flooding covered portions of Texas State Highway 316 and John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway.[8] The storm's outer periphery dropped locally heavy rainfall that reached 10.81\u00a0in (275\u00a0mm) at Brownsville International Airport,[9] which flooded homes in Brownsville and streets near San Benito.[8] Light rainfall also occurred elsewhere along the gulf coast.[9] In Louisiana, tides were 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) above normal, which flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 1 and several houses. The floods damaged two houses in Mandeville, and damage statewide was estimated at $5.5\u00a0million.[8] After residents refused to evacuate Grand Isle, over 200\u00a0people were stranded when floodwaters rose.[10] Josephine made landfall in northwestern Florida along Apalachee Bay and produced a high storm surge of around 9.3\u00a0ft (2.8\u00a0m) in Suwannee,[1] causing minor to moderate beach erosion.[8] The storm produced widespread tropical storm force wind gusts in the state, and the highest sustained winds were 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h) along the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; the same location reported a peak gust of 72\u00a0mph (115\u00a0km/h).[1] Josephine dropped heavy rainfall in the state, peaking at 11.39\u00a0in (289\u00a0mm) in Fernandina Beach.[11] The storm also spawned at least 16\u00a0tornadoes in northern Florida, most of which caused minor tree damage.[1] One 400\u00a0yd (370\u00a0m) wide tornado, rated an F2, remained on the ground for 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) in Edgewater, which damaged 130\u00a0houses, 30 of them severely. The tornado caused a woman to have a heart attack in Edgewater, and its damage was estimated at $2.4\u00a0million.[1][8] In western Florida, the high tides flooded roads and buildings along the coast. Between Levy to Lee county along the gulf coast, Josephine flooded about 3,600\u00a0homes, mostly west of U.S. Route 19. The heaviest storm surge damage was in Pinellas County, where about 1,400\u00a0homes were affected, causing $25\u00a0million in damage. One person was injured in the county when a man was surfing in rough seas.[8] The high tides damaged three fishing piers along the west coast.[12] In Clay County, flooding rains forced about a dozen families to seek shelter elsewhere, and a few roads were washed out. In Jacksonville, high rains flooded hundreds of roads and caused schools countywide to close. Street flooding occurred as far south as the Florida Keys. High winds caused sporadic wind damage across northern Florida,[8] and about 400,000\u00a0people lost power statewide.[13] Following the storm, President Bill Clinton declared 16\u00a0counties as disaster areas, which made them eligible for federal assistance in reconstructing.[14] When the remnants of Josephine moved into Georgia, rainfall of over 7\u00a0in (180\u00a0mm) flooded portions of Georgia State Route 40 and destroyed six houses along the St. Marys River.[8] A woman died after driving into a downed tree in the state.[15] In South Carolina, the storm caused flash flooding that covered roads and cars, after 6\u00a0in (150\u00a0mm) of precipitation fell. Wind gusts in the state reached 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) along the coast, while high tides caused minor beach erosion. The remnants of Josephine spawned a weak tornado in Horry County that downed trees and power lines.[8] Heavy rainfall, including reports of 4\u00a0in (100\u00a0mm) in three and a half hours, also affected North Carolina, which flooded low-lying areas, rivers, and portions of several roads including U.S. Route 70. A woman and her child required rescue from a flooded road in Chadbourn. In some areas of eastern North Carolina, the storm raised river levels only weeks after they receded following Hurricane Fran. High winds of up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) downed trees and power lines, causing power outages and dozens of traffic accidents;[8] one man died while driving amid heavy rainfall.[15] High tides flooded barrier islands and caused erosion in beaches, previously affected by hurricanes Bertha and Fran earlier in the year.[8] In conjunction with a cold front, Josephine spawned three tornadoes in the state along the state's central coastline. The tornadoes destroyed several mobile homes, uprooted trees, and brought down power lines.[16] After having tracked across the southeastern United States, Josephine emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean as a strong extratropical cyclone and remained near the coast. It continued to bring strong winds and heavy rainfall.[8] In southeastern Virginia, where wind gusts reached 63\u00a0mph (101\u00a0km/h) at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel, the storm left about 26,000\u00a0people without power, while flooding contributed to over 70\u00a0traffic accidents.[17] A three car accident killed a man in the state.[15] In neighboring Maryland, the storm produced a peak wind gust of 77\u00a0mph (124\u00a0km/h) in St. Mary's County and in Ocean City, which knocked down trees onto houses and left about 7,000\u00a0people without power. In the Chesapeake Bay, waves of 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) in height caused minor coastal damage and flooded portions of the coastline, including along Maryland Route 238.[8] In Ocean City, a 160\u00a0ft (49\u00a0m) barge broke from its moorings during the storm, which later washed ashore.[8][15] About 4,000\u00a0people lost power in Delaware, where winds reached 58\u00a0mph (93\u00a0km/h) and high tides, peaking at 7.6\u00a0ft (2.3\u00a0m) at Lewes, flooded oceanfront homes and a portion of Delaware Route 1. High rainfall caused the Christina River to crest at 10.6\u00a0ft (3.2\u00a0m), causing some people to require rescue from their cars. About 1,500\u00a0people lost power in southeastern Pennsylvania, when high winds knocked down some tree limbs onto power lines. In neighboring New Jersey, high winds of around 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) left about 31,000\u00a0homes without power, and 12\u00a0houses lost their roofs during the storm. In both New Jersey and New York, rainfall was around 1 to 3\u00a0in (25 to 76\u00a0mm), causing minor street flooding.[8]  While passing offshore New England, the remnants of Josephine produced gusts as high as 68\u00a0mph (109\u00a0km/h) at Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory in Massachusetts. Minor street flooding occurred in the state after the storm dropped up to 4.50\u00a0in (114\u00a0mm) of rainfall on Cape Cod. Throughout New England, the high winds downed trees and branches, causing scattered power outages in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.[8] Nationwide, damage was estimated at $130\u00a0million (1996\u00a0USD).[1] Later, the remnants of Josephine moved across Atlantic Canada, where rainfall peaked at 2.76\u00a0in (70\u00a0mm) in northern Newfoundland. The strongest winds in the region were 52\u00a0mph (83\u00a0km/h), strong enough to cause ferry service to be canceled or delayed. In Amherst and Fort Lawrence, the storm caused power outages and school closings.[18]",

      "Cyclone Carmen": "Cyclone Carmen (or Windstorm Carmen)[1] was an extratropical cyclone and European windstorm which crossed the Atlantic Ocean and affected the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in November 2010.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Windstorm Carmen formed as a low-pressure system off the east coast of the United States.[2] By 9 November, while over Nova Scotia, the system was named \"Carmen\" as it passed into the North Atlantic[2] near and over southern Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, which had been suffering from the lesser windstorm Becky[citation needed] since the 5th. Becky died out over Denmark and Northern Germany on the 12th, and its remnants joined windstorm Carmen over Russia on the 14th.[3] Due to a strong pressure gradient, gale-force winds were recorded in the United Kingdom. A 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h) wind gust was recorded at Capel Curig, Wales.[3] Traveling eastward, Carmen eventually attained a central pressure of 949\u00a0millibars as it struck the United Kingdom.[2] At 06:00 UTC on Friday, 12 November 2010, Carmen was over the North Sea, east of Scotland, with a central pressure of approximately 965\u00a0mb (965\u00a0hPa).[2] Carmen was last noted over western Russia on 14 November 2010, as it continued to weaken, and had burnt itself out over the Former Yugoslavia, Eastern Europe, Moscow, and the Gulf of Finland between 18 and 19 November 2010.[2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "8 November[edit]": "High winds and rough seas battered the western coastline of Ireland on the nights of 7\u20138 November 2010. Heavy sleet and rain fell across the Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, coastal Lancashire, Cumbria, and coastal Wales on the 8 November.[4][5] Minor spot floods hit part of the Salthill promenade in Galway, with traffic diverted through the Salthill village as Assistant Commissioner John Twomey warned of strong winds and debris making driving conditions difficult in Ireland.[5]",
      "Ireland[edit]": "The storm grew in intensity, and a heavy band of rain hit Western Ireland on the morning of 8 November 2010,[4] then Wales and Wessex between 04:00 and 07:00 UTC. By 09:00 UTC, the rain had reached most of England, Wales, and western Scotland.[4] Minor flooding was reported in Oxfordshire over Radio Oxford, and the Channel Islands and Normandy's Cotentin peninsula were also hit.[4] The heaviest rainfall was over patches of southwest Ireland, Pembrokeshire, Bristol, Dumfriesshire, Morecambe Bay, Carlisle, central Lancashire, Sussex, Surrey, parts of the English Channel, and Cherbourg.[4] A crash in County Galway killed two people due to weather-related road conditions.[5] Another fatal nighttime road accident occurred on the Mountmellick to Emo road at Knightstown, Mountmellick, in which a male cyclist was fatally injured after being hit by a car.[5] A Brazilian man from the English Midlands drowned in a car accident that morning on the Offaly\u2013Westmeath border. His car skidded off the road between Rhode and Rochfortbridge, hit a roadside bank, and rolled on its roof into the flood-swollen water of the River Monagh on the 8th.[5] The water levels at Galway Docks and the Claddagh Basin rose violently in the evening as extensive sand-bagging was put in place at the Spanish Arch, Quay Street and Flood Street for the short term. County Cork was hit by minor flooding, and the owners of Penrose Quay feared heavy tidal flooding of the quay as wind and waves sloshed against it menacingly at evening high tide.[5] Garda\u00ed Assistant Commissioner Twomey said in a press interview: \"Sadly, so far this year over 190 people were killed on the national roads. 35 people were killed during October, making it one of the worst months for fatalities since February 2008\". He went on to warn of the hazards caused by decreasing seasonal daylight and a greater chance of encountering wet and slippery road surfaces.[5] In County Galway a van and a bus carrying 27 students from County Mayo to Limerick skidded on groundwater and crashed at Glenafosha outside Tuam just after 7:30 pm, killing both drivers and injuring 12 of the students.[5]",
      "Northern Ireland[edit]": "High winds, driving rain, and occasional snow hit Northern Ireland. Ice, floods and fallen trees affected most roads. Gale-force winds ripped through Downpatrick and County Londonderry overnight. The Foyle Bridge in the city of Derry was closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.[6] The Glenshane Pass was cleared of snow and gritted, but there were 22 incidents of flooding on roads overnight. Roads throughout the country were closed due to fallen trees and flooding.[6]",
      "England and France[edit]": "In England a major HSE rail investigation was launched after a morning commuter train skidded along Charing Cross to Hastings line on wet leaves. The train from Charing Cross sped through one station at 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h); the terrified driver immediately contacted signal control center to raise the alarm as his train skidded down the track for 2\u00a0mi (3.2\u00a0km), after he braked when approaching Stonegate railway station in East Sussex. At midday the Met office issued a severe weather alert for the whole UK as Britain was battered by 70\u00a0mph winds (110\u00a0km/h), with snow in the north of England and up to 3 inches (76\u00a0mm) of rain across the east Midlands, south and south east. There were gusts of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) at Berry Head in Devon and 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) in Dundrennan, Dumfries and Galloway. High winds and waves battered Whitley Bay in North Tyneside and gale-force winds hit parts of London, Penbrokeshire and the Pennines. Weather overnight caused much chaos in the UK,[7] and periodic gale-force northerly winds hit most of the UK at some time during the night. The worst-affected areas were the northwest and southeast tips of England.[7] On the evening of the 8th, 28-year-old kitesurfer Adrien Monnoyeur from Toulouse ignored safety warnings and was killed as a gale in the Saint Jean de Luz resort, near Biarritz in southwest France, dragged him at 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) across the beach and fatally slammed him down from 50\u00a0ft (15\u00a0m) in the air onto the beach, after hitting the Grand Hotel and a local pier en route. Winds on the 8 November had top speeds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h). A weather warning was issued for parts of south-east and south-west England, due to up to 70mm of predicted rain overnight.[8]  Fourteen flood warnings were in place for Wales, the English Midlands and North East England, and a severe weather warning for parts of south Wales.",
      "Scotland[edit]": "The Northlink ferry MV Hjaltland was due to dock in Aberdeen, but was diverted to Rosyth[8] as Aberdeen harbour was closed for 18 hours[4]  over the 8th and 9th.[9] Snow was a problem in the Highlands and on high roads such as the A9 at Drumochter in the Scottish Highlands and on the M74 north of Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway. Heavy rain replaced earlier snow in Aberdeen, Braemar and Dumfries and Galloway. Snow fell continuously at the Cairngorm Mountain resort and the A93 Glenshee to Braemar road was closed because of drifting snow and high winds as blizzards were reported around Dumfries.[8] The storm had mostly ended in Ireland, Wales and Wessex by 20:00, but had intensified over Northern Ireland and Ayrshire. It remained in several scattered, but heavy bands across the British Isles, with only County Antrim, Perthshire, Glasgow, Edinburgh,  County Durham, Cumbria, Lancashire, Norfolk, Berkshire, southern Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex being badly affected from through the night.[8]",
      "9 November[edit]": "On the 9th, 9 flood warnings and 33 flood watches were still in effect in the UK.[10][11] Heavy thunderstorms continued in some areas but mostly died out through the afternoon.[4] Snow was a bigger problem, occurring in the English Midlands and Scotland.[9]  Vehicles had to be rescued in Cumbria and Wessex, with many road closures.[12] Train, ferry and some air services were also affected by high winds.[13]",
      "10\u201311 November[edit]": "A new band of heavy rain moved eastward over the UK and Ireland on the 10th.[4] This second storm complex moved rapidly overnight on the 10th and 11th,[4] with thunderstorms and torrential rain being reported near Bristol, parts of central Ireland and from central Scotland to the English North Midlands.[4] It reached Belgium and left Ireland, Wessex, and Wales by 10:00 on the 11th.[4] The only gale-force winds in the second system were in coastal areas, with heavy rainfall causing limited flooding.[14] Donegal was worst hit in Ireland, with isolated flooding occurring throughout Ireland and Northern Ireland.[15]  The Irish Farmers Association reported that the River Shannon burst its banks in numerous places. Several roads were blocked by fallen trees across the island, causing disruption to road travel.",
      "12\u201313 November[edit]": "",
      "UK and Ireland[edit]": "The heaviest rainfall recorded on the weekend of 12 November was 29\u00a0mm in 12 hours in Shap, Cumbria, while Lancashire and Yorkshire saw 7\u201310\u00a0mm in the same period. The Isle of Wight, which had suffered flooding earlier in the week, was flooded again due to heavy rains with 100 homes affected. At Aberdaron in Gwynedd, Wales, a 36\u00a0m/s (130\u00a0km/h) wind gust was reported on 12 November[citation needed]. Downed trees and unsafe structures were also a problem in Wales in the aftermath of earlier storms. Widespread rainfall and some heavy winds occurred throughout the afternoon.[4] Winds were strongest in coastal and elevated locations, with gusts generally in the range of 27\u201331\u00a0m/s (97\u2013113\u00a0km/h) and up to 40\u00a0m/s (140\u00a0km/h; 89\u00a0mph) in some areas or even 160\u00a0km/h (99\u00a0mph) according to some reports. In one case, a falling tree struck and killed a motorist in Yorkshire.[16] Another woman died in Pinderfield's Hospital after being impaled by a tree branch during winds of up to 90\u00a0mph in Pontefract, West Yorkshire.[17][18] Some had to evacuate their homes in this period,[17][18] and aircraft had to be diverted from Leeds Bradford International Airport when gusts reached 100\u00a0mph. Flights and ferry crossings to the Isle of Man were also cancelled.[17][18] A wind speed of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) was recorded on Great Dun Fell in the Pennines.[17][18] The worst-hit places in this period were the Isle of Wight, Anglesey, Northern Ireland, North West England, Yorkshire and the Humber.[17][18] Blackpool Tower suffered structural damage and surrounding roads were closed. A paving slab hit a fairground ride in Bridlington, causing \u00a330,000 worth of damage.[19][20] Approximately 5,000 people were left without electricity in Northern Ireland.[17]",
      "Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands[edit]": "On November 12, many Belgian rivers and canals rose above the national alarm level, with some of their defenses failing. Four deaths occurred over the weekend in Belgium.[21] A third weather band drifted up from off the coast of Brittany and hit southwest Ireland, Cornwall and Normandy's Cotinian Peninsula at 07:00 on the 12th, moving inland.[4] Gusts of 62\u00a0mph hit the coast of northwest England that morning.[17][18]  A heavily loaded fishing boat capsized in the Baltic Sea, but the captain, who was alone, was safely rescued.[citation needed] Beyond some flooding and snowfall, the original storm had mainly dissipated by Friday evening.[4][22] In continental Europe, high winds caused the Karneval festivities in Cologne and elsewhere in the Rhineland to be cut short. The St. Martin's Day procession was cancelled in Aachen and minor flooding and high winds occurred in various parts of Germany, but no one was injured.[23] Two people died in southern Belgium, according to Dutch and RTBF. A man was washed away in a street and a 72-year-old woman was killed in her car. Both fatalities occurred during the night of the 13 November, in the community of Solre-Saint-G\u00e9ry, part of Beaumont, near the French border.[24][25] By the afternoon another body was found in nearby Lessines.[26] Firefighters worked desperately to patch up polders, dykes, and river defences in Germany. Road and rail traffic were disrupted, but quickly restored.[25] Emergency teams reinforced dams, dykes, bridges and canal/river banks, relieving the firefighters.[24] Belgian weather experts and state authorities described the flooding in that country as the worst in 50 years. The national weather service said Belgium had as much rainfall in two days (13th and 14th) as it normally gets in a month.[27] Belgium was badly flooded and Li\u00e8ge was cut off on the 14th.[24][28] The flood defences[29] failed in places.[24] The River Dendre flooded Brussels heavily, reaching 46\u00a0cm above alarm level along with several canals on 14 November. 200 houses were evacuated. The Meuse basin also rose 2 metres above the mean level.[21] Floods and heavy rainfall also began in the Netherlands on the 14th.[30] Heavy rains flooded out the centre of the seaside town of Granville in northern France after 2\u00a0inches of rain fell on the region within 24 hours, according to Radio France Internationale.[26] At least one death occurred in Granville during the storm.[26]",
      "15\u201316 November[edit]": "Further flooding and mudslides occurred in Belgium on the 15th. One person was swept away by the floods as she tried to cross a bridge in the south.[31] Army rescue teams helped with emergency evacuations, including a hospital, as many of Belgian's roads were blocked or flooded.[31] Several Belgian regions put disaster emergency plans into operation as a canal burst its banks in several places near Brussels leading to more than 200 houses being evacuated and a pharmaceutical factory closed down due to local flooding.[31] Though the weather had improved, flooding remained a problem in Belgium. A staggering 80 litres per square metre were recorded in a few locations.[32] Despite the 4 deaths and heavy material losses involved, the Belgian government refused to take any responsibility for the state's lack of preparedness for flooding.[32] Both the heavily flooded southern Netherlands and wind-ravaged Luxembourg had no deaths at all in the same period.[32] In the Netherlands, the River Maas broke its banks, causing flooding in several towns. In Limburg, even hilly regions were affected.[30] In the east of North Brabant province, the local water board deliberately flooded fields the size of 50 football pitches to keep the river from rupturing its crumbling embankments.[30] At the town of Baarlo, three rivers rose from 2 to 50 meters at their junction and ran through the town on the 15th.[30] Luxembourg was affected by the same weather complex, but received little, if any damage.[30] Similar scenes occurred in the north of Par.[30]",
      "17 November[edit]": "A new band of rain and thunderstorms hit the UK and Ireland on the 17th.[4] Parts of France and the coast of Portugal experienced heavy storms on that day as well,[33] as did the Bay of Biscay and Iceland.[33] On the 17th, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to send aid to Cornwall, still experiencing heavy rains and gale-force winds.[34] Luxulyan,[35][36][37] Both police[35] and Ben Johnston, flood risk manager for the Environment Agency, declared the flooding a \"major incident\"[36][37] with hundreds of residents evacuated.[35]  Schools were closed and the transport network was hugely disrupted with interruption of train services and motorists urged not to drive in Cornwall.[35] By mid afternoon the rain had lessened and police and military worked together with a helicopter to rescue people from their cars and houses in Cornwall.[38] A heavy mudslide near Lostwithiel cut off local roads and water completely surrounded the village of Mevagissey, which was evacuated.[38] Pentewan residents dubbed a  \u00a31,300,000 flood relief scheme approved by the Environment Agency \"money down the drain.\"[39] In Belgium, the rivers Nete, Demer, and Ijzer had risen to danger level.[21] Storms continued over parts of Europe into the evening.[40]",
      "18\u201321 November[edit]": "Belgium continued to experience heavy rains, and both Belgium and Cornwall continued to be on flood alert.[4] Prince Charles visited the Cornish villages of St Austell, Lostwithiel and St Blazey between the 19th and the 21st, pledging financial aid for the people of Cornwall. Prime Minister Cameron visited Lostwithial and St Blazey on the 19th, denying that he had misled Parliament when he said flood protection money had been safeguarded in the spending review. He also denied having alluded to plans to reform flood relief financing.[41][42][43][44][45][46][47] Storms moved to Scandinavia, most of Eastern Europe, some parts of Central Europe, the Balkans, Kyiv, Moscow and Morocco by the 19th. Though the weather had cleared in the UK, heavy storms continued to hit the western coast of Ireland, Dublin, and Northern Ireland on the night of the 18th and morning of the 19th.[48][49] Flooding and traffic disruption continued in Northern Ireland through the 19th, with main roads flooded out.[48][49] Becky and Carmen died off in northwest Russia by the 20th.[33]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "The floods came at a politically delicate time for the UK as its coalition government reneged on a long-held pledge to protect flood defences from government imposed spending cuts. This included a \u00a3100,000,000 plan to protect Leeds,[37] though the \u00a314,250,000 Banbury flood prevention scheme would continue.[50] Total relief funds were cut from \u00a3335,000,000 a year to \u00a3261,000,000 for the next 4 years despite climate change Secretary Chris Huhne saying that extreme weather would become more common over time.[37] There were also plans to build permanent flood defences in Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire at an estimated cost of \u00a34,500,000.[51]  In Ireland, on the other hand, flooding policies helped reduce storm-related damage.[37] Several businesses in Lostwithiel were badly damaged by the mudslide there. Mud ruined several \u00a33,000 ball gowns in a clothes shop, and a bakery was destroyed.[39] The repairs and flood defences were estimated to cost millions of pounds and take about a year to complete.[52] European insurers agreed on 25 October that they needed to hold up to 37,000,000 euros ($51,480,000) of extra capital under new fiscal solvency rules to cover potential losses from windstorm damage in Europe, in the light of events such as Windstorm Emma, according to loss and exposure aggregator PERILS.[53] Windstorms are expected to increase in air pressure and strength over Europe and the Americas over the next 5\u201310 years.[54] The Eurowind probabilistic risk assessment model that quantifies the prospective risk from windstorms in Europe and is part of WORLDCATenterprise, EQECAT's catastrophe-event-modelling software platform, and would be used to calculate future prospective windstorm and flooding losses.[55][56] The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and CloudSat satellite would be used to assess the extent of any future storms as they first emerge in the atmosphere.[57] The insurance company AXA sponsored a three-year-long \u20ac275 million catastrophe bond from 2 November 2, 2010 to cover European windstorm risks in the event of a disaster like Windstorm Emma earlier that decade. The nations covered by the bond scheme are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.[58] Axa closed its upsized \u20ac275,000,000 catastrophe bond on 2 November to cover itself against potential losses from European windstorms, after upsizing the insurance bond twice in 2010 to meet heavy investor demand. The Irish firm Calypso Capital will be used to cover against potential windstorm insurance claims in its nine Western European member countries between 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2014.[59]",

Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Philippines in mid-August\u00a01985, the system gradually became better organized, and was upgraded into a tropical storm early on August\u00a016. It continued to deepen, and late on August\u00a017, Mamie attained typhoon intensity. Around this time, Typhoon Mamie reached its peak intensity of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), which it maintained for 12\u00a0hours. After making landfall in Shanghai, the storm steadily weakened. However, after turning north and crossing the Shanghai Peninsula and the Yellow Sea, Mamie made a second landfall near Yantai as a tropical storm. After turning northwest and re-entering the Yellow Sea, Mamie moved ashore for the third and final time near Dairen. On August\u00a021, Mamie dissipated inland over northeastern China. Due to both Mamie and Nelson, widespread flooding was reported across much of northern China, with 19\u00a0rivers overflowing. The typhoon forced around 1,000\u00a0factories to temporarily close, and toppled approximately 6.5\u00a0million trees. Moreover, about 8,000\u00a0homes were flooded and 120,000\u00a0houses received damage Nearly 1\u00a0million people were directly affected by the typhoon. The typhoon killed more than 120,000\u00a0animals and sank more than 200\u00a0boats. Overall, 17\u00a0fatalities occurred and 165\u00a0were injured. Losses totaled $172\u00a0million (1985\u00a0USD).",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Typhoon Mamie originated from the southwesterly monsoonal flow near the Philippines. The monsoon flow was situated near Tropical Storm Lee, which was situated east of Taiwan at that time. At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014, banding features were noted via satellite imagery. The system was first monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) at 0600\u00a0UTC on August\u00a014; the JTWC noted that the chances of significant development were poor. Throughout the day, the system became better organized while turning north[1] and at 1800\u00a0UTC that day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started watching the disturbance.[2][nb 1] Early on August\u00a015, the JTWC remarked that the storm had a \"fair\" chance at potential development. As such, Hurricane Hunter aircraft was requested. Following an increase in banding features and outflow, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the JTWC that afternoon. Thereafter, the cyclone began to strengthen as interaction with Tropical Storm Lee diminished. At 2300\u00a0UTC on August\u00a015, the aircraft discovered a closed low-level circulation, as well as tropical storm-force winds.[1] Based on this, both agencies designated the system as Tropical Storm Mamie early on August\u00a016.[4][nb 2] On August\u00a016, the tropical storm began to turn northwest in response to the strengthening of a subtropical ridge north of Mamie and a westward-moving mid-latitude cyclone.[1] At 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a017, the JTWC classified Mamie as a typhoon while the JMA reported winds of 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph), a severe tropical storm. Around midday, the JTWC estimated winds of 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph), equivalent to a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[4] However, the aforementioned ridge was not strong enough to prevent the storm from turning north-northwest on August\u00a017.[1] That evening, the JMA upgraded Mamie to typhoon status. Simultaneously, the JMA estimated peak winds of 120\u00a0km/h (75\u00a0mph), and a minimum barometric pressure of 975\u00a0mbar (28.8\u00a0inHg). According to the JMA,[2] the typhoon held on to peak intensity for 12\u00a0hours while moving onshore near Shanghai on August\u00a018.[1] Mamie only gradually weakened overland, but according to the JMA, the storm's winds had decreased to 105\u00a0km/h (65\u00a0mph) midday on August\u00a018.[4] Typhoon Mamie moved offshore at 0200\u00a0UTC on August\u00a019;[1] subsequently, the JTWC estimated winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) while the JMA estimated winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph).[4] After crossing the Shanghai Peninsula, Mamie entered the Yellow Sea while turning north along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, and at 0600\u00a0UTC, struck Yantai[1] as a minimal tropical storm.[4] Following a turn towards the northwest, Tropical Storm Mamie briefly emerged into the Yellow Sea before making a third and final landfall just west of Dairen at noon.[1] At the time of landfall, both the JMA and the JTWC reported winds of 70\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph).[4] Due to interaction with the mountainous terrain of China, Mamie began to dissipate over land, and by 0000\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the JTWC ceased watching the cyclone.[1] The JMA followed suit 42 hours later.[2]",
      "Preparations, impact, and aftermath[edit]": "Roughly 24\u00a0hours prior to Mamie's third landfall, all ships were warned in the port of Dalian to evacuate; however, 152 ships stayed at the port.[6] Shortly after making landfall, Mamie was considered the worst storm to affect northeastern China in 26\u00a0years.[7][8] The nation was already inundated by significant flooding earlier in the summer of\u00a01985, especially from Typhoon Nelson.[9] After making landfall, Typhoon Mamie dropped 420\u00a0mm (17\u00a0in) of rain in Liaoning, where the storm flooded 300,000\u00a0ha (741,315 acres) of farmland.[10] Due to a combination of Mamie and previous flooding, 19 rivers overflowed.[11] The typhoon forced 1,000 factories to temporarily close,[12] and toppled about 6.5\u00a0million trees.[13] Over 8,000\u00a0dwellings were flooded. More than 3,000 residents were evacuated in the Jilin province.[14] At least 36,400\u00a0villagers necessitated rescue.[12] Nearly 1 million individuals were directly affected by the typhoon.[15] Elsewhere, in Yantai, the typhoon killed more than 120,000\u00a0animals, damaged 120,000\u00a0homes, and sank more than 200\u00a0boats.[16] Waves up to 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) in height pounded the Bohai Bay shoreline, forcing more than 200\u00a0ships to be evacuated. Cables securing an oil rig were snapped.[10] One person died while trying to fasten steel products on a ship.[6] In all, 17\u00a0people perished[17] and 165\u00a0were injured due to Mamie.[18] Loses totaled $172\u00a0million.[13] After the passage of Typhoon Mamie, more than 800,000\u00a0civilians and 9,000 soldiers were organized in order to protect reservoirs from flooding.[19] By August\u00a028, 150,000\u00a0civilians and 10,000\u00a0soldiers were fighting against flooding along the Liao River on a daily basis.[12] Additionally, local military forces were called in to assist relief workers.[18] The government organized buses and boats to carry flood victims. Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.[14]",

      "Schoolhouse Blizzard": " The Schoolhouse Blizzard, also known as the Schoolchildren's Blizzard, School Children's Blizzard,[2] or Children's Blizzard,[3] hit the U.S. Great Plains on January 12, 1888. With an estimated 235 deaths, it is the world's 10th deadliest winter storm on record.",
      "Description[edit]": "The blizzard came unexpectedly on a relatively warm day, and many people were caught unaware, including children in one-room schoolhouses. The weather prediction for the day was issued by the Weather Bureau, which at the time was managed by Brigadier General Adolphus Greely. The indications officer (forecaster), Lieutenant Thomas Mayhew Woodruff in St. Paul, Minnesota, said: \"A cold wave is indicated for Dakota and Nebraska tonight and tomorrow; the snow will drift heavily today and tomorrow in Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.\"[4] On January 11, a strengthening surface low dropped south-southeastward out of the Alberta District in Canada's North-West Territories into central Montana Territory and then into northeastern Colorado by the morning of January 12. The temperatures in advance of the low increased some 20\u00a0to 40\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C) in the central plains (for example, Omaha, Nebraska, recorded a temperature of \u22126\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221221\u00a0\u00b0C) at 7\u00a0a.m. on January 11, while the temperature had increased to 28\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C) by 7\u00a0a.m. on January 12). The strong surface low rapidly moved into southeastern Nebraska by 3\u00a0p.m. on January 12 and finally into southwestern Wisconsin by 11\u00a0p.m. that same day. On January 11, the massive cold air mass that had formed around January 8 around Medicine Hat and Qu'Appelle, Assiniboia District, had reached a spread of over 780 miles (1,255\u00a0km).[5] The blizzard was precipitated by the collision of an immense Arctic cold front with warm moisture-laden air from the Gulf of Mexico. Within a few hours, the advancing cold front caused a temperature drop from a few degrees above freezing to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) [\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0C) in some places]. This wave of cold was accompanied by high winds and heavy snow. The fast-moving storm first struck Montana in the early hours of January 12, swept through Dakota Territory from midmorning to early afternoon, and reached Lincoln, Nebraska, at 3\u00a0p.m. Many who were caught unaware misjudged the weather due to a warm spell. Carl Saltee, a teenage Norwegian immigrant in Fortier, Minnesota, remembered that \"... on the 12th of January 1888 around noontime it was so warm it melted snow and ice from the window until after 1\u00a0p.m.\" This changed rapidly for the teenager who continued that by 3:30\u00a0p.m. \"A dark and heavy wall built up around the northwest coming fast, coming like those heavy thunderstorms, like a shot. In a few moments, we had the severest snowstorm I ever saw in my life with a terrible hard wind, like a Hurricane, snow so thick we could not see more than 3 steps from the door at times.\"[5] The Boston Daily Advertiser reported under the headline \"Midnight at Noon\" that \"At Fargo ... mercury 47\u00b0 below zero and a hurricane blowing ... At Neche, Dak. the thermometer is 58\u00b0 below zero.\"[6] What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness of the storm, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people \u2014 including many schoolchildren \u2014 got caught in the blizzard. The death toll was 235, though some estimate 1,000.[7] Teachers generally kept children in their schoolrooms. Exceptions nearly always resulted in disaster.[8] This cold front was so self-reinforced that it dropped temperatures as far south as Veracruz, Mexico, before dissipating. Travel was severely impeded in the days following. Two months later, yet another severe blizzard hit the East Coast states: This blizzard was known as the Great Blizzard of 1888. It severely affected the east coast, in states like New York and Massachusetts.",

      "Cyclone Imogen": "Tropical Cyclone Imogen was a weak but damaging tropical cyclone that affected parts of northern Queensland. The sixth tropical low, and the first cyclone of the 2020\u201321 Australian region cyclone season, Imogen originated from a tropical low that formed in the western Gulf of Carpentaria. Imogen caused minimal destruction on the northern part of Queensland as a Category 2 cyclone, causing approximately $10 million in damages.[1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On 1\u00a0January, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) reported that a tropical low had formed near Groote Eylandt in the western Gulf of Carpentaria, located about 635\u00a0km (395\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Darwin.[2] The system was assigned the identifier code 05U by the BOM.[3] Environmental conditions were assessed as being favourable for tropical cyclogenesis, characterised by very warm sea surface temperatures of up to 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F), low to moderate vertical wind shear and an established poleward outflow channels in the upper levels.[4] Flaring convection began to develop around the consolidating low-level circulation centre as the system tracked southeastward over the Gulf of Carpentaria, and at 00:00\u00a0UTC on 2\u00a0January, the BOM issued a tropical cyclone watch for parts of the northwestern Queensland coast.[4][5] The tropical low continued to strengthen as convective rainbands began to wrap into the system's centre, with moist northwesterly cross-equatorial flow from over Indonesia feeding the system in the low to mid troposphere.[3] By 18:00\u00a0UTC, vertical wind shear values had decreased further as the tropical low moved underneath an upper-level ridge; however, despite the highly favourable environmental conditions, intensification was limited somewhat by the broad and elongated nature of the low-level circulation center.[6] The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 20:00\u00a0UTC.[7] Tropical Low 05U made landfall on the western coast of Mornington Island at around 02:00\u00a0UTC on 3\u00a0January, with maximum sustained winds near the centre of 55\u00a0km/h (34\u00a0mph).[8] Intensification proceeded as the system re-emerged over the Gulf of Carpentaria a few hours later, with spiral rainbands continuing to develop around the centre of the system and deep convection becoming more concentrated. At 06:00\u00a0UTC, the tropical low was upgraded to a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone by the BOM, and was named Imogen, becoming the first tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 Australian region cyclone season.[9][10] At the same time, the JTWC indicated that maximum one-minute sustained winds had increased to 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), making Imogen equivalent to a tropical storm on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.[11] In combination with the low-level northwesterly flow, an upper-tropospheric trough situated to the south of the system began to gradually accelerate Imogen towards the southeast. Deep convection continued to concentrate over the centre of the cyclone; however, due to the system's proximity to land, limited time was available for further intensification.[12] Tropical Cyclone Imogen made landfall just to the north of Karumba, Queensland, at 11:00\u00a0UTC on 3\u00a0January.[13][14] At the time of landfall, maximum 10-minute sustained winds were estimated at 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph), with gusts to 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 994\u00a0hPa (29.35\u00a0inHg).[12] The JTWC reported that maximum one-minute sustained winds had reached 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) by this time.[15] Despite the centre of the system tracking over land, Imogen maintained its organisation for several hours, assisted by the flat terrain that had been saturated by heavy rainfall generated by the cyclone.[14] The BOM reported that maximum 10-minute sustained winds peaked at 85\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph), with gusts to 110\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph), at 15:00 UTC on 3 January\u2014about four hours after landfall\u2014as the cyclone was passing to the northeast of Normanton.[16] At this time, the automatic weather station at the town's airport recorded a minimum atmospheric pressure of 989.3\u00a0hPa (29.21\u00a0inHg).[17] Imogen later accelerated North-East before finally dissipating on January 6.[18]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "The BOM maintained cyclone warnings for the inland Gulf Country including Croydon due to Cyclone Imogen.[19] As Cyclone Imogen blasted portions of north-west Queensland, it left extensive damage behind. It brought extreme torrential rain, massive waves and massive high tides as it made landfall.[18] A house in Queensland shaked nearly 5 hours due to the tropical cyclone. It dumped more than 200 millimetres of rain at many places and left 1400 without power. Normanton Airport recorded 186mm of rain in less than 3 hours.[20] A resident in Karumba described it as if it was an earthquake. Most of the damage was limited to damages from flooding and several uprooted trees.[21][20] In Victoria, extreme rain fell over Gippsland and flood warnings was in place.[22] The cyclone caused at least $10 million of damages.[23]",

      "Typhoon Nesat (2017)": " Typhoon Nesat, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Gorio, was a strong tropical cyclone that impacted Taiwan and Fujian, China. It was the ninth named storm and the second typhoon of the annual typhoon season. After consolidating slowly for several days, Tropical Storm Nesat developed east of the Philippines on July 25. While experiencing favorable environmental conditions such as very warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, Nesat strengthened into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity on July 28. On July 29, the typhoon made landfall near the Taiwanese city of Yilan, before weakening to a severe tropical storm and making landfall again near Fuqing on China's east coast late the same day. Moving into July 30, Nesat continued to weaken under the effects of land interaction.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "A tropical disturbance accompanied by a broad low-pressure area formed near Palau on July 21; its circulation and associated convection remained elongated and disorganized for the next few days.[1][2] However, on July 25, the system began to consolidate, with formative convective banding wrapping into its low-level circulation center. As such, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical depression, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert shortly after.[3] Meanwhile, PAGASA also stated that the system had intensified into Tropical Depression Gorio.[4] Despite having a partially exposed LLCC, the JTWC also upgraded the system to a tropical depression early on July 26, after scatterometer data and the Dvorak technique revealed sufficient organization.[5] Soon after that, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and assigned it the international name Nesat while it was located about 600\u00a0km (375\u00a0mi) east-northeast to Naga, Philippines.[6] Later on July 26, JTWC followed suit and upgraded it to a tropical storm.[7] Tropical Storm Nesat began to intensify slowly as it tracked generally northwestward along the western edge of an extension of the subtropical ridge centered to the east, aided by a weak anticyclone over the system and a vigorous equatorward outflow channel. By the morning on July 27, the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm.[8][9] Amid favorable conditions with weakening vertical wind shear and sea surface temperatures of over 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) in the area southeast of Taiwan, Nesat intensified into a typhoon at around 06:00 UTC on July 28.[10] Despite a new tropical depression to the west of the typhoon restricting outflow to the west,[11] Nesat strengthened further to reach its peak intensity at around 18:00 UTC, with the central pressure at 960 hPa (28.35 inHg) and ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 150\u00a0km/h (90\u00a0mph). As Nesat continued to approach Taiwan, animated radar imageries from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) of Taiwan and microwave imagery depicted a developing eye with strong spiral banding.[12][13] Maintaining its peak intensity, Typhoon Nesat made its first landfall over Su'ao, Yilan County in Taiwan at 11:10 UTC and re-emerged over the Taiwan Strait from Zhunan, Miaoli County at 14:30 UTC.[14][15] The mountainous terrain of Taiwan caused Nesat's convective structure to rapidly decay while cloud tops quickly warmed. At around 21:00 UTC, the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm, and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm.[16][17] At around 22:00 UTC on July 29, Nesat made its second landfall over Fuqing, Fujian, China.[18] About five hours later, the JTWC issued their final warning on Nesat.[19]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "Even though Typhoon Nesat (Gorio) remained well away from the country, the system enhanced the southwest monsoon which resulted in torrential rains and extreme flooding. Damages reportedly reached \u20b1247.58 million (US$4.9 million).[20] On July 27, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea announces the suspension of work in all government offices and classes in public school at all levels in Metro Manila due to inclement weather.[21]",
      "Taiwan[edit]": "Before Nesat made landfall, more than 10,000 people, largely from the southern parts of Taiwan, were evacuated and 1,612 were moved into shelters. A total of 145 international flights were cancelled. As Nesat moved inland, it produced strong winds that downed power lines, leaving nearly half a million households without electricity. A total of 111 people were injured when the typhoon hit.[22][23] Agricultural losses across the country were estimated at $176 million NT (US$5.83 million). Nearly 200 schools across Taiwan were damaged, accounting for about $17.8 million NT (US$588,000) of losses.[24] Together with Tropical Storm Haitang a few days later, a total of $280.5 million NT (US$9.26 million) worth of damage was inflicted on the country.[25]",
      "China[edit]": "Some 70,000 people have been evacuated and dozens of trains and flights suspended in Fuzhou, according to Fujian's water resources department.[citation needed]",

      "Hurricane Laura": " Effects Other wikis Hurricane Laura was a deadly and destructive Category\u00a04 hurricane that is tied with the 1856 Last Island hurricane and 2021's Hurricane Ida as the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in the U.S. state of Louisiana, as measured by maximum sustained winds. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura originated from a large tropical wave that moved off the West African coast on August\u00a016 and became a tropical depression on August\u00a020. Laura intensified into a tropical storm a day later, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm on record in the North Atlantic basin, forming eight days earlier than 1995's Hurricane Luis. Laura first hit the Lesser Antilles and brushed Puerto Rico as a tropical storm, then moved across the island of Hispaniola, killing 31\u00a0people in Haiti and four in the Dominican Republic. The storm then moved across the length of Cuba, prompting tropical storm warnings and the evacuation of more than 260,000\u00a0people there. Subsequently, the outer rainbands extended into the Florida Keys and South Florida. Laura then moved across the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before a period of rapid intensification on August\u00a026. That day, Laura became a major hurricane, and later attained its peak 1-minute sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), making it a Category\u00a04 hurricane. The approaching storm prompted the issuing of many warnings and watches for Louisiana, as well as the evacuation of many people. Early on August\u00a027, Laura made landfall near peak intensity on Cameron, Louisiana. Measured by windspeed, Laura was the tenth-strongest U.S. hurricane on record to made landfall in the USA. The effects of Laura across Louisiana were devastating. Nearly 10-foot high storm surge was recorded in Cameron Parish. Numerous parishes had severe flooding and extreme damage to houses. Several roads had to be closed, and drivers were advised to use different routes. The storm caused the deaths of 30 people in the state alone. Texas and Arkansas were struck notably hard as well. The storm caused the deaths of at least 41\u00a0people in the United States. An estimated $23.3 billion in damages was inflicted  on southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas near the Gulf of Mexico.[1][2] After landfall, Laura caused significant wind damage in southwest and central Louisiana before becoming a tropical storm later that day. It weakened further to a tropical depression over Arkansas the next day. On August\u00a029, Laura degenerated into a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed into another extratropical storm near the East Coast of the U.S. shortly afterward. Overall, Laura caused more than $23.3 billion in damage and 81\u00a0deaths. Areas that were affected by Laura, namely the Gulf Coast, were affected again six weeks later by Hurricane Delta.",
      "Meteorological history": "On August\u00a016, 2020, a tropical wave along the eastern end of a monsoon trough emerged off the west coast of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean.[3] At this time, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis over the next five days as environmental conditions gradually became more favorable for development.[4] The system produced disorganized convection over a broad area and steadily consolidated.[5] A surface low accompanied by organizing banding features coalesced about 700\u00a0mi (1,100\u00a0km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.[6] By 03:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a020, the low and accompanying convection became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression, the thirteenth of the season, about 1,035\u00a0mi (1,666\u00a0km) east-southeast of the Leeward Islands. The depression moved briskly west-northwest in response to the Bermuda High to the north, a high that would steer the system throughout its lifetime.[7][8] After struggling to intensify for over a day, the depression center reformed and an increase an organization and the presence of tropical storm-force winds prompted an upgrade to tropical storm status and storm was named Laura.[9][10] This marked the earliest classification of a season's twelfth named storm since reliable records began in 1851, surpassing the previous record set by Hurricane Luis, on August\u00a028, 1995.[11] Moderate wind shear hampered further development through August\u00a022, displacing the bulk of convection east of the surface circulation.[12] Early on August\u00a022, Laura traversed the Virgin Islands and sideswiped Puerto Rico to the south before making landfall in the southeastern Dominican Republic with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles per hour (80\u00a0km/h) early on August\u00a023.[13][14] Despite interacting with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, the overall structure of Laura actually improved with little intensity loss.[15] Laura subsequently traversed Haiti and emerged over the Windward Passage.[16] Once back over water, the storm intensified some and made a brief landfall around 00:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a024 in Santiago de Cuba Province, Cuba, with winds of 60\u201365\u00a0mph (97\u2013105\u00a0km/h) before emerging over the Caribbean along Cuba's southern coast.[17][18][19] Laura's structure briefly degraded on August\u00a024 before it reorganized and traversed Pinar del R\u00edo Province in western Cuba, early on August\u00a025.[20][21][22] Maintaining a west-northwest trajectory, Laura entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and quickly organized throughout August\u00a025, reaching hurricane-strength by 12:15\u00a0UTC.[23][24] After moving out of an area of dry air, the hurricane began a period of rapid intensification on August\u00a026.[25][26] The storm grew in size and featured a well-defined eye surrounded by increasingly symmetric deep convection.[27] By 12:00\u00a0UTC, Laura strengthened into a Category\u00a03 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale before becoming a Category\u00a04 hurricane six hours later.[28][29] Continuing to strengthen into August\u00a027, Laura reached its peak intensity of 150 miles per hour (240\u00a0km/h), a high-end Category\u00a04 hurricane, and a minimum pressure of 937\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.67\u00a0inHg).[30] At this time, the hurricane turned north toward the Texas\u2013Louisiana coastline within a weakness along the western edge of the Bermuda High.[31] Little change in intensity took place in the few hours before Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron, Louisiana, around 06:00\u00a0UTC on August\u00a027 near peak strength, as its pressure had risen by 2 mbar. Laura matched the strength of the 1856 Last Island hurricane for strongest landfall in the state and was the first Category\u00a04 landfall on record in southwestern Louisiana.[32] Progressing inland across southwestern Louisiana, Laura produced destructive winds over a wide area, although the storm rapidly weakened as it progressed farther inland. Steady filling of the storm and the disappearance of its eye ensued throughout the day, and Laura weakened to a tropical storm by 17:00\u00a0UTC about 50 miles (80\u00a0km) east-southeast of Shreveport.[33][34] Maintaining tropical storm-force winds, the system progressed into southwestern Arkansas.[35] By August\u00a028, Laura degraded to a tropical depression over central Arkansas; heavy rain became the primary threat across the Southeast.[36] Around that time, the NHC issued their final advisory on Laura, passing on the responsibility for issuing advisories to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).[37] Gradually losing tropical characteristics, the weakening storm accelerated east-northeast within the mid-latitude westerlies.[36][38] The system ultimately degenerated into a remnant low over Kentucky early on August\u00a029, as it began merging with an approaching extratropical storm.[39] Laura's remnant low continued moving eastward, before being absorbed into the approaching extratropical system several hours later over Maryland.[40][41]",
      "Preparations": "",
      "Lesser Antilles and Virgin Islands": "In preparation for the storm, schools were closed in Anguilla and Antigua.[42] A tropical storm watch was issued for several islands in the group on August 20, being upgraded to a warning the next day.[43][44] The storm prompted the closing of all ports in the British Virgin Islands.[45]",
      "Dominican Republic": "Tropical Storm Laura brought damaging winds and flooding rains to much of the Dominican Republic. Precipitation was heaviest along the southern coast, with a peak 24-hour accumulation of 11.7\u00a0in (300\u00a0mm) in Barahona.[102] Approximately 1.1\u00a0million people lost power while 1.56\u00a0million people experienced disruption to water services.[103][104] Early assessments as of August\u00a024 indicated significant damage to 1,791\u00a0homes, prompting the evacuation of 8,995\u00a0people.[104] In Santo Domingo, a woman and her son died after their house collapsed, due to the rain brought by Laura,[105] and in Pedro Brand, a man died when a tree fell on his house.[106] Severe flooding was reported across Santo Domingo.[107] A police officer died after falling on a downed electric cable in the El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a Province.[108]",
      "Haiti": "Following the passage of Laura, Haiti's Directorate General of Civil Protection (DGCP) began damage assessments. The agency quickly distributed food kits to affected residents in the Ouest, Nippes, Sud-Est, and Sud departments. Water treatment products were sent to Anse-\u00e0-Pitres and Belle-Anse by the National Directorate for Drinking Water and Sanitation. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) deployed medical teams across the country to assist the Haitian National Red Cross Society, though transport of victims was hampered by limited access to ambulances. Eleven schools were converted to shelters; however, many evacuees opted to stay with neighbors or relatives due to fears of COVID-19.[228]",
      "Jamaica and Cayman Islands": "Flash flooding across Jamaica caused significant disruptions to road infrastructure. A weather station in Negril, Jamaica observed 4.97\u00a0in (126\u00a0mm) of rain.[102] A landslide blocked the main road to Gordon Town; unstable terrain hampered efforts to clear debris. A bridge in Saint Thomas Parish was washed away, isolating residents of Trinityville, Georgia, and Cedar Valley.[113] Additionally, the main road connecting Papine to Dallas Castle in Bull Bay collapsed.[114] Wind gusts reached 35 to 40\u00a0mph (56 to 64\u00a0km/h) along southern coastlines near Kingston, and in Montego Bay on the country's north coast.[102]  Initial damage estimates totaled to around J$54\u00a0million (US$360,000) according to Jamaica's National Works Agency (NWA).[88] Rounds of gusty winds and heavy rainfall affected the Cayman Islands as Laura passed just to the north.[115]",
      "Cuba": "After clearing Hispaniola, Tropical Storm Laura brought damaging winds and flooding rains to Southeastern Cuba on August\u00a023\u201324. Wind gusts reached 91\u00a0mph (146\u00a0km/h) in Mais\u00ed, tearing roofs off homes and downing trees.[112] Rainfall reached 9.51\u00a0in (241.5\u00a0mm) in Complejo Palma, Santiago de Cuba, and 7.50\u00a0in (190.6\u00a0mm) in San Antonio del Sur, Guant\u00e1namo. Damage across Holgu\u00edn Province was relatively limited; some structures and crops were damaged and scattered power outages occurred. A bridge in Buey Arriba, Granma Province, collapsed due to flooding, which isolated 30\u00a0communities. A station in Cabo Cruz recorded sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) and a gust of 65\u00a0mph (104\u00a0km/h). Minor flooding and power outages occurred in Las Tunas Province.[52]",
      "United States": "The governors of both Texas and Louisiana surveyed storm damage in the hardest hit parts of their respective states after the storm had passed. Roads in both Calcasieu and Cameron Parishes in Louisiana were impassable, cutting off road access to both Cameron and Creole. About 200,000 people were left without drinking water after Laura made 80 water systems inoperable. Additionally, some areas saw complete destruction in their power grids, and over a million people lost power. Some areas were expected to be without power for weeks or even months. Multiple homes also were uninhabitable due to air conditioning units being destroyed. Recovery efforts were hampered by additional rainfall in the days after Laura had passed.[229] After the storm, President Donald Trump approved a post-storm major disaster declaration for 23 parishes in Louisiana on August\u00a027. Two days later, he visited the areas most heavily affected by the storm, including Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, and Orange County. Trump visited the Cajun Navy, a rescue organization, and met with Governor John Bel Edwards.[230] Post-storm assessments indicated extensive damage and losses to Louisiana's timber industry with some small private forest landowners reporting complete loss of their timber acreage, an outcome which they had not experienced in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita, 15 years earlier.[231] Extensive damage was also reported to Louisiana's industrial facilities with one-third showing some type of damage and nine out of the 138 facilities showing critical damage, causing environmental concerns. Some of the most critically damaged facilities were the BioLab facility in Lake Charles and the Equistar Chemical facility in Westlake, and the Chemical Waste Management facility and the Lotte Chemical plant in Lake Charles.[232] Many of the repairs in Louisiana were undone six weeks later by Hurricane Delta, which made landfall just 12 miles (19\u00a0km) east of where Hurricane Laura did, with many areas in and around hard-hit Lake Charles being damaged again.[233][234]",
      "Puerto Rico": "In Puerto Rico, Laura downed trees and caused flooding in Salinas.[119] Part of the Salinas city sign was also blown over during the storm.[120] A peak of 4.09\u00a0in (104\u00a0mm) of precipitation was reported in Villalba, with a peak wind gust of 75 miles per hour (120\u00a0km/h) being reported in Salinas.[121] Roughly 200,000 customers lost power in Puerto Rico, with nearly 14,000 losing access to running water.[122]",
      "Florida": "Tropical storm-force wind gusts affected several counties across southern Florida, particularly Collier, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties. A gust of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) was observed at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station.[123] Farther south, a strong squall line moved through Key West, damaging streetlights, downing a tree, and generating a 69\u00a0mph (111\u00a0km/h) wind gust at the National Weather Service's Key West office.[124][125] On August 25, a St. George Island first responder drowned while trying to rescue a swimmer caught in rough surf.[89]",
      "Texas": "Before the hurricane made landfall, one person was killed and another injured after rough surf from Laura slammed them against jetties in Corpus Christi on August 26.[93] Another man died after he was electrocuted while preparing for the storm.[95] Eastern Texas saw a few tornado warnings as Laura neared landfall on August 26 as well, but no tornadoes were confirmed.[127][128] Coastal water rises in the southeast part of the state began at around 20:00 UTC that same day.[170] Wind gusts in both Houston and Galveston peaked at 38 miles per hour (61\u00a0km/h).[171] A wind gust of 79 miles per hour (127\u00a0km/h) was recorded at Kirbyville Raws site near Call and trees were downed in Groves.[172][173] In Port Arthur, trees were downed, including one that fell on a house, and a parking lot lamp snapped at its base.[174][175][176] A large tree also fell on and damaged a house in Beaumont.[177] Structural damage occurred in near Pinehurst just west of Orange, where multiple trees and power lines where downed and several structures, including a church, were damaged.[178][179][180] Structural damage also occurred in Bridge City.[181] More trees and power lines were blown down across both Angelina and Sabine Counties, some of which blocked roads.[182][183][184] In Hemphill, a roof collapsed at an Ashley HomeStore and multiple roads were blocked by falling trees.[185][186] A man was killed northeast of the town when a tree fell on him while he was sitting on a recliner in his home.[94] Southeast of the city, trees fell on homes and blocked all exits in the McGee's Landing Area.[187] East of Center, a tree and power lines fell on FM 417 and FM 2694.[188] Following the storm, five people died in Southeast Texas in four separate incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of improperly-placed generators.[96] One person in Newton County was also killed in the cleanup process.[97]",
      "Louisiana": "The first report of sustained tropical-storm force winds on land was at Cypremort Point, on Vermilion Bay, where 45 miles per hour (70\u00a0km/h) winds were recorded.[126] Numerous tornado warnings began to be issued throughout Louisiana as Laura approached the coast on August\u00a026.[127][128] An EF0\u00a0tornado touched down briefly near Paincourtville, although no damage occurred.[129] Another tornado was reportedly spotted by a trained spotter in Bell City, but was never confirmed.[130] Coastal water rises began at around 19:00 UTC on August 26.[131] Cameron saw at least 9.19 feet (2.80\u00a0m) of storm surge.[132] Holly Beach was extensively damaged as an RV was destroyed and several homes suffered roof damage.[133] Storm surge flooding also covered SH 82.[134] The town of Hackberry was severely damaged by storm surge flooding and two trains were derailed in Grand Lake, where the Grand Lake High School suffered damage.[135][136][137] Severe damage occurred throughout Lake Charles with widespread catastrophic-level damage to residential and commercial building roofs and structure, as well as half of all matured trees either blown down, badly stripped of branches, or 'broken over'. Double- and Triple-KVA (kilovolt-amp) power transmission towers and lines feeding power throughout the area were heavily damaged and/or destroyed. An RV was blown over and many mobile homes in parks were knocked off of their mounts, some rolled over, older ones stripped of their siding and gutted. The Lake Charles Regional Airport saw a wind gust of 128 miles per hour (206\u00a0km/h) as well as multiple hangars destroyed.[138][139][140][141] Another wind gust in the city reached 137 miles per hour (220\u00a0km/h).[142] Many windows were blown out of Capital One Tower in Downtown Lake Charles.[143] Intracoastal City saw a storm surge of 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m).[144] Storm surge also flooded over SH 317 at Burns Point in St. Mary Parish.[145][146] In Sulphur, a hotel was damaged.[147] Extensive structural damage also occurred in Vinton.[148] Softwood trees were blown down on Fort Polk.[149][150] The NWS radar at Fort Polk also suffered a communication outage, causing it to go down.[151] A home in Carlyss had its roof and entire back room ripped off, while another home was damaged in New Llano after a carport was blown into it.[152][153] There was extensive damage to trees, power lines and poles, and structures in De Quincy and much of the town of Delcambre was left underwater due to flooding.[154][155] A tree was blown down onto a fraternity house in Lafayette.[156] Hurricane Laura caused the largest power outage in Baton Rouge since Isaac in 2012.[157]\nIn Shreveport a tree fell on a house, injuring a person inside, while another tree fell on a vehicle.[158][159] In Monroe, metal roofing was blown off of multiple buildings.[160] Widespread flooding was reported in Natchitoches Parish, where I-49 had to be closed past SH 174 west of Powhatan due to a downed tree.[161][162] The police station in Robeline had its roof ripped off to go with the numerous downing of large trees throughout the town.[163][164] Near Bossier City, a large tree was blown down on the Centenary College of Louisiana campus while several homes were damaged by falling trees south-southwest of the city.[165][166] In Greenwood, flash flooding led to high water over the shoulder roads of I-20 at exit\u00a05 with drivers being advised to use US 80 as an alternative.[167] A total of 30\u00a0fatalities occurred throughout the state, four of them arising from falling trees. They included a 14-year-old girl in Vernon Parish, a 68-year-old man in Acadia Parish, a 51-year-old man in Jackson Parish, and a 64-year-old man in Allen Parish.[168] Carbon monoxide poisoning from generators being inside homes, which is strongly discouraged, led to the deaths of twelve people in Calcasieu Parish and two people in Allen Parish.[90][91] Another man died of drowning while aboard a sinking boat during the storm.[169] Finally, one person died in Calcasieu Parish in a house fire, four people died in Calcasieu Parish, Natchitoches Parish, and Rapides Parish during the cleanup process, and eight others died in Beauregard Parish, Grant Parish, Rapides Parish, and Vernon Parish due to heat-related illnesses following the loss of electricity.[90]",
      "Mississippi": "Despite the reduced surge threat on the coast, Mississippi still faced the threat of tornadoes from the storm, especially on the western side of the state. A number of tornado warnings were issued for parts of the state starting on August 26 with an EF0 tornado confirmed in Oxford on August 27.[127][128][189][190] Widespread flash flooding occurred across Jefferson Davis County. In Natchez, trees were blown down and a sign at an Autozone damaged six vehicles when it was blown down.[191][192] A tree was also blown down on a house in Warrenton.[193]",
      "Arkansas": "Laura entered Arkansas while still at tropical storm strength. Numerous tornado warnings were issued in Arkansas with eight tornadoes confirmed in the state, the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded in the state during the month of August.[128][189][194][195] A high-end EF1 tornado caused significant damage to a church in Lake City, though no one was hurt or injured.[190][196] This same storm dropped another high-end EF1 tornado north of Brookland.[190] A rare PDS tornado warning was also issued for this tornado.[197] The storm then dropped its strongest tornado, which was rated low-end EF2, which damaged structures and homes southwest of Maynard.[198] Widespread flash flood warnings were issued throughout the state. A 57 miles per hour (92\u00a0km/h) wind gust was recorded just south of El Dorado, causing several trees and power lines to fall, two of which landed on houses. This caused many power outages in Union County.[199][200][201] Numerous trees were downed in the Doddridge area, including one on US 71, causing numerous power outages.[202] South of Bradley near the Louisiana/Arkansas state line, a tree fell on AR 29, blocking the road.[203] AR 343 was shut down between Lewisville and AR 53 due to falling trees.[204]  Uprooted trees fell on power lines in Dermott and a barn also had its roof removed in Wilmot.[205][206] Trees were uprooted and power lines were downed across a widespread area in several counties.[207][208][209][210][211][212][213] In the town of Camden, numerous trees were blown down, including one that fell on a house, and a metal roof was blown off a shop building.[214][215] Downed trees were also reported in Sheridan and power poles were snapped along US 67 northeast of Caddo Valley.[216][217] Eastbound I-30 was shut down west of Hope at mile marker 26 due to a downed tree blocking both lanes of the freeway.[218] In Kingsland, several large trees were blown down, including one that significantly damaged a house.[186] In Goodrich, a house carport was destroyed with a hole through its wall.[219] Several roads east of Mena were closed due to flooding.[220] A portion of County Road 106 southwest of Ravenden was washed out due to flooding, and flash flooding in Sherwood left an intersection impassable.[221][222]",
      "Impact": "Laura caused widespread devastation throughout most of its path with tropical-storm force winds going over almost all of the Antillean Islands, hurricane and tropical-storm force winds impacting parts of Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas, and flooding rain and storm surge affecting a large portion of the storm's path. Losses are estimated at over $19.1\u00a0billion,[1][2] and at least 81\u00a0people were killed, with\u00a063 of them coming from Haiti and Louisiana alone, making Laura the 16th-costliest hurricane on record. With agricultural losses estimated at $1.6 billion, Laura did more agriculture damages in Louisiana than Hurricanes Katrina and Rita combined.[98]",
      "Lesser Antilles": "As Laura passed through the Leeward Islands, the storm brought heavy rainfall to the islands of Guadeloupe and Dominica, which was captured on radar imagery from Guadeloupe.[99] In the Netherlands Antilles, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint-Maarten saw minor flooding. Scattered power outages affected 4,000\u00a0people in Saint Kitts and Nevis.[100] In the Virgin Islands, a peak wind gust of 41 miles per hour (66\u00a0km/h) was reported in Sandy Point, Saint Croix. It caused some power outages and flash flooding across the Virgin Islands.[101]",
      "Elsewhere": "Moderate to heavy rainfall impacted the eastern half of Oklahoma, prompting a flash flood warning in Le Flore County.[223] Outflow from the storm also generated a band of southwest-moving thunderstorms that extended from Oklahoma City southward to the Texas border. In Tennessee, a flash flood warning was issued in Memphis and tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in the western part of the state late on August 27. The next day, more warnings issued, including one tornado warning for areas just north of Nashville, which had been hit by a high-end EF3 tornado just under six months earlier.[223][189] Two EF0 tornadoes were confirmed in the state.[224] Multiple tornado warnings were also issued in Southern Missouri, Kentucky, Northern Alabama, and Eastern Maryland.[189][225] Four tornadoes were confirmed in Alabama with three being rated EF1 while the other was rated EF0.[226][227]",
      "Aftermath": "",
      "Retirement": "Due to the damage and loss of life in Louisiana and southeast Texas, the name Laura was retired from the Atlantic rotating naming lists by the World Meteorological Organization in March 2021, and will never be used again for an Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with Leah for the 2026 season.[235][236]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Typhoon Soudelor": " Typhoon Soudelor, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Hanna, was the third most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2015 after Hurricane Patricia and Cyclone Pam as well as the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2015 Pacific typhoon season. Soudelor had severe impacts in the Northern Mariana Islands, Taiwan, and eastern China, resulting in 40\u00a0confirmed fatalities. Lesser effects were felt in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. The thirteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Soudelor formed as a tropical depression near Pohnpei on July 29. The system strengthened slowly at first before entering a period of rapid intensification on August 2. Soudelor made landfall on Saipan later that day, causing extensive damage. Owing to favorable environmental conditions, the typhoon further deepened and reached its peak intensity with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and a central atmospheric pressure of 900 hPa (mbar; 26.58\u00a0inHg) on August 3. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center assessed one-minute sustained winds at 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph), making Soudelor a Category\u00a05-equivalent super typhoon. Steady weakening ensued thereafter as the storm moved generally west-northwest. Soudelor made landfall over Hualien, Taiwan, late on August 7 and emerged over in the Taiwan Strait early the next day. The typhoon soon moved inland over eastern China and degraded to a tropical depression by August 9. Soudelor was the second worst storm to strike Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands in nearly 30\u00a0years (following Typhoon Yutu of 2018). Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed and power was expected to take a month to restore. Two people died in Guam due to rip currents. In Taiwan, torrential rains and destructive winds caused widespread damage and disruptions. A record-breaking 4.85\u00a0million households lost power on the island. At least 8\u00a0people died and 420\u00a0others sustained injury there; a ninth person died in the storm's aftermath. Portions of eastern China saw their heaviest rains in 100\u00a0years, resulting in deadly floods and landslides. Typhoon Soudelor killed 45 people in eastern China after parts of the country were hit by the heaviest rains in a century. Total economic losses were counted to be \u00a524.627\u00a0billion (US$3.97\u00a0billion).[1]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On July 28, 2015, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[nb 1] began monitoring a tropical disturbance about 415\u00a0km (258\u00a0mi) north of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The system featured a developing low level circulation accompanied by deep convection.[3] Moving generally west under the influence of a subtropical ridge,[4] the disturbance gradually organized amid favorable environmental conditions. A tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) cell enhanced upper-level outflow, offsetting the negative effects of moderate wind shear; high sea surface temperatures and ocean heat content provided ample energy for further development.[5] At 14:30\u00a0UTC on July 29, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system.[6] Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)[nb 2] began monitoring the system as a weak tropical depression;[8] the agency began full advisories on the system at 00:00\u00a0UTC on July 30.[9] The JTWC followed suit later that day, designating the system as Tropical Depression 13W.[10] The cyclone achieved tropical storm intensity by 12:00\u00a0UTC, at which time it was assigned the name Soudelor, a title of legendary rulers in the Pohnpeian language.[11][12][13] A central dense overcast developed over the circulation center shortly thereafter.[14] Some structural degradation took place on July 31 owing to subsidence from a TUTT cell to the north.[15][16] Following a retreat of the TUTT cell northward,[17] Soudelor's convective structure improved with well-defined banding features wrapping into the circulation by August 1.[18] The organizing storm, with a redeveloped central dense overcast, soon entered a region favoring rapid intensification, including low wind shear, sea surface temperatures of 31\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u201390\u00a0\u00b0F) and high ocean heat content.[19] Therefore, the JMA upgraded Soudelor to a severe tropical storm by 18:00\u00a0UTC.[20] Rapid intensification ensued on August 2 as the storm approached the Northern Mariana Islands with both agencies classifying Soudelor as a typhoon.[21][22][23] The typhoon developed an unusually small eye only 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) in diameter, among the smallest ever observed in a tropical cyclone. At 14:54\u00a0UTC, Soudelor made landfall along the southern coast of Saipan.[21] After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle,[24] Soudelor continued rapid intensification, reaching peak intensity on August 3. The JMA estimated peak ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) and a minimum central pressure of 900\u00a0hPa (27\u00a0inHg),[25] while the JTWC estimated peak one-minute maximum sustained winds of 285\u00a0km/h (177\u00a0mph), classifying Soudelor as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon. Intensity leveled off thereafter, and after maintaining Category 5 intensity for 24 hours, Soudelor was downgraded to a Category 4 super typhoon late on August 4.[26] On August 5, PAGASA reported that the Typhoon Soudelor entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility assigning the name Hanna.[27] Soudelor weakened further to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon and stayed at that intensity for a day. On August 7, the typhoon reintensified to reach a secondary peak as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon,[26] and later that day, Typhoon Soudelor made landfall over Xiulin, Hualien in Taiwan at 20:40 UTC on August 7 (04:40 TST on August 8), and it arrived in the Taiwan Strait from Taixi, Yunlin around 03:00 UTC (11:00 TST) on August 8.[28][29] Around 14:10 UTC (22:10 CST) on the same day, Soudelor made landfall over Xiuyu District, Putian, Fujian in China as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon.[30][31] Quickly degrading, Soudelor moved erratically northwest. 24 hours after landfall, Soudelor was downgraded to a depression, before becoming extratropical six hours later The remnants re-looped eastward, before briefly re-attaining gale-force winds as it moved offshore near Yancheng, Jiangsu. The remnants were last noted on August 13, affecting Kyushu and Ch\u016bgoku region.[citation needed]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Mariana Islands[edit]": "Typhoon Soudelor passed directly over Saipan on August 2 as an intensifying Category 2 equivalent storm according to the JTWC,[32] causing widespread damage on the island.[33] Post-storm damage surveys determined Soudelor to have been substantially stronger at landfall: a Category 4-equivalent with sustained winds of 215\u00a0km/h (134\u00a0mph) with gusts in excess of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph).[34][35] The National Weather Service's anemometer at Saipan International Airport broke after recording a gust of 146\u00a0km/h (91\u00a0mph).[21] The winds downed numerous trees and power lines, leaving much of the island without power and rendering roads impassible.[36] In some areas, cars were flipped over by the force of the wind. The island's power plant lost part of its roof and was flooded.[37] Damage to the island's electrical infrastructure was tremendous, with 150\u00a0power poles and 114\u00a0transformers damaged or destroyed.[38] A total of 464\u00a0residents sought refuge in public shelters.[39] Acting Governor Ralph DLG Torres declared \"a state of disaster and significant emergency\". Philip Dauterman of the Commonwealth Health Center in Saipan likened damage to that caused by Typhoon Pongsona which struck Guam in December 2002.[37] In addition, John Hirsh from the American Red Cross said that Soudelor is the most damaging cyclone to hit Saipan since Typhoon Kim in 1986 struck the island nearly thirty years prior.[40] Initial assessments by the Emergency Operations Center indicate that 384\u00a0homes were destroyed. A separate assessment by the American Red Cross showed 808\u00a0homes affected. Of this total, 158\u00a0were destroyed, 296\u00a0sustained major damage, and 354\u00a0were affected or sustained minor damage.[41] Total damage exceeded US$21\u00a0million (2015 USD) on Saipan. Forty people were injured across the island.[34] On August 8 and 9, two people drowned in separate rip current incidents in western Guam.[42] The local power company, Commonwealth Utilities Corp., stated they only had 77\u00a0replacement power poles and no transformers. Repairs to the electric grid, water supply network, and wastewater systems were expected to take three to four weeks.[38] Three Mobil gas stations re-opened on August 4 for first responders and emergency services.[43] Relief supplies from Guam and Hawaii were sent to Saipan that day. Members of the Guam National Guard, Guam Power Authority, and the Coast Guard also provided assistance.[39] On August 6, United States President Barack Obama declared the Northern Mariana Islands a federal disaster area, allowing residents to receive government aid. Saipan was granted individual assistance while Tinian and Rota received public assistance.[44][45] By September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved US$25.9\u00a0million in aid to residents of Saipan.[46]",
      "Japan[edit]": "Prior to striking Taiwan, the circulation of Typhoon Soudelor battered Japan's southern Ryukyu Islands with typhoon-force winds. Sustained winds on Yonaguni island reached 163\u00a0km/h (101\u00a0mph) with concurrent gusts to 233\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph), the strongest winds recorded in relation to the storm throughout its path. Ishigaki Island saw a peak gust of 198\u00a0km/h (123\u00a0mph). Farther north at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa Island, gusts reached 84\u00a0km/h (52\u00a0mph). Heavy rains accompanied these winds, with Yonaguni reporting 451\u00a0mm (17.74\u00a0in) during the storm's passage.[47] Structural impact was relatively minor, mainly confined to damaged roofs on Yonaguni island. Three people sustained minor injuries in the region.[48] Losses to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries across the Yaeyama District reached \u00a5360\u00a0million (US$2.9\u00a0million). A total of 6,748 hectares (16,670 acres) of crops sustained damage.[49] In Miyako-jima, crops sustained significant damage from salt; relatively little rain coupled with strong winds allowed sea spray to travel farther inland than normal. Preliminary estimates placed losses at \u00a594.52\u00a0million (US$761,000).[50] On August 10, a family of four was swept out to sea near Irabu-jima by residual swells from the typhoon; three drowned while the fourth, an 8-year-old girl, was rescued.[51]",
      "Taiwan[edit]": "On August 6, four people in Su'ao, Yilan were swept away while watching waves. One person, a child, survived; two others are confirmed dead, and the fourth is still missing.[52][53] By August 10, eight fatalities had been confirmed, while four others were reported missing. Additionally, 420\u00a0people sustained injuries.[54] All 279 domestic flights were canceled on August 8, as well as at least 37 international flights.[55] The center of the storm made landfall in eastern Taiwan at 04:40\u00a0a.m. local time on August 8. By mid-morning, Soudelor had maximum sustained winds of 173\u00a0km/h (107\u00a0mph; 93\u00a0kn), according to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB).[56] Northern and mountainous areas of Taiwan saw the strongest winds, with Pengjia Islet reporting sustained winds of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph) and a peak gust of 211\u00a0km/h (131\u00a0mph). A gust of 230\u00a0km/h (143\u00a0mph) was reported in Su'ao; however, this value was later retracted by the CWB due to possible accuracy concerns. Taoyuan International Airport in Taoyuan reported a gust of 150\u00a0km/h (93\u00a0mph).[47] These winds caused Taipei 101's tuned mass damper to sway a record 100\u00a0cm (39\u00a0in).[57] Taiping Mountain in eastern Taiwan's Yilan County saw the heaviest rains from the typhoon, with accumulations peaking at 1,334\u00a0mm (52.52\u00a0in).[47][56] Rainfall in the Wulai District reached 722\u00a0mm (28.4\u00a0in) in 24\u00a0hours, the second-highest on record behind Typhoon Matsa in 2005. Twelve-hour accumulations amounted to a record 632\u00a0mm (24.9\u00a0in).[58] At the height of the storm, 4.85\u00a0million households lost electricity.[54] This was the largest blackout on record in Taiwan due to a typhoon, surpassing the previous record of 2.79\u00a0million after Typhoon Herb in 1996.[59] Water supply to 429,248\u00a0homes and land line telephone service to 64,992\u00a0homes was cut during the storm.[54] A contaminated Nanshi River suffered a drastic overflow, and soon mixed with the primary water source of the Taipei-Keelung metropolitan area.[60] The river's turbidity reached record levels in just two hours, catching Taipei's Water Department off-guard.[58] The excess water overwhelmed the regional purification system. As a result, the water supply to approximately 5\u00a0million households in Taipei was polluted for the next few days.[61] Agricultural damage in Taiwan exceeded NT$3.03\u00a0billion (US$94.8\u00a0million). The banana crop suffered the greatest impact, with 5,436 hectares (13,430 acres) damaged; losses from the crop reached NT$460.15\u00a0million (US$14.3\u00a0million).[62] Six windmills of Taipower were destroyed.[63] Approximately 100\u00a0people were listed as missing after contact was lost with Xiaoyi village (Siaoyi) in Wulai District of New Taipei City during the storm on August 8. Reports from firefighters dispatched to search for residents reported that homes in the area had \"disappeared\" following a large landslide.[64][65] All residents were later accounted for on August 10.[66] A soldier was crushed to death while trying to clear debris on August 13.[67]",
      "China[edit]": "Typhoon Soudelor killed 45 people in eastern China after parts of the country were hit by the heaviest rains in a century. Total economic losses were counted to be \u00a524.627\u00a0billion (US$3.97\u00a0billion).[1] Making landfall in Fujian around 10:10\u00a0p.m. local time on August 8, the storm brought damaging winds to coastal cities in the region. The storm is regarded as the most severe to strike Fujian Province in a decade. The strongest gust was 191\u00a0km/h (119\u00a0mph) in Putian while nearby Fuzhou saw gusts up to 134\u00a0km/h (83\u00a0mph).[47][68] Gusts in excess of typhoon force were almost entirely confined to Fujian. Gale-force winds extended into Jiangxi and Zhejiang. Much of East China saw torrential rains from the storm, with accumulations of at least 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) reported in several provinces. Portions of Zhejiang Province saw 24\u2011hour rainfall totals with a return period of 100\u2013120\u00a0years.[68] Wencheng County recorded 645\u00a0mm (25.4\u00a0in) during the same span \u2013 the heaviest in 100 years. Country-wide accumulations peaked at 806\u00a0mm (31.7\u00a0in) within Wenzhou. Soudelor's merger with a cold front over Anhui and Jiangsu brought torrential rains to the region from August\u00a09\u201310. The heaviest rains fell in central Jiangsu Province, peaking at 467\u00a0mm (18.4\u00a0in) along the central coastline.[68]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "Typhoon Soudelor's proximity to the Philippines prompted PAGASA to issue Public Storm Warning Signal#1, the lowest on a five-tier scale, for Batanes and Cagayan provinces, including the Calayan islands, from August\u00a06\u20138.[69][70][71] Signal #2 was raised for Batanes on August 7.[70] The storm's circulation enhanced the southwest monsoon and brought rains to Luzon and portions of the Western Visayas. Overall impacts were minor, with 58,255\u00a0people affected; 45,444\u00a0of these people sought refuge in public shelters. Agricultural damage in Batanes were at \u20b1363,000 (US$7,900).[72] Hong Kong experienced its hottest day on August 8, since records began, as a result of air descending on the outer fringe of Soudelor. The Hong Kong Observatory observed a temperature of 36.3\u00a0\u00b0C (97.3\u00a0\u00b0F), breaking the previous record of 36.1\u00a0\u00b0C (97.0\u00a0\u00b0F) set in 1900 and 1990.[73] Air pollution was also severe on August 7 and 8 across the entire territory, with readings on Tap Mun reaching level 10.[74] The typhoon's remnants brought locally heavy rain to parts of South Korea on August 11, with accumulations reaching 25 to 60\u00a0mm (0.98 to 2.4\u00a0in).[75]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "Due to the destruction and deaths caused by the storm in the Northern Mariana Islands, Taiwan and China, the name Soudelor was officially retired at the Fourth Joint Session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee and WMO/ESCAP Panel on Tropical Cyclones during 2016. In February 2017, they chose the name Saudel to replace Soudelor.[76]",

      "1991 Perfect Storm": " The 1991 Perfect Storm, also known as The No-Name Storm (especially in the years immediately after it took place)[1] and the Halloween Gale/Storm, was a damaging and deadly nor'easter in October 1991. Initially an extratropical cyclone, the storm absorbed Hurricane Grace to its south and evolved into a small unnamed hurricane later in its life. Damage from the storm totaled over $200 million (1991 USD)[2] and thirteen people were killed in total, six of which were an outcome of the sinking of Andrea Gail, which inspired the book and later movie, The Perfect Storm. The nor'easter received the name, playing off the common expression, after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger. The initial area of low pressure developed off the coast of Atlantic Canada on October 28. Forced southward by a ridge to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone. The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast. On November 1, the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane, with peak sustained winds of 75 miles per hour (120\u00a0km/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the precursor extratropical storm. The system was the twelfth and final tropical cyclone, the eighth tropical storm, and fourth hurricane in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating. Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical, after waves up to 30 feet (10\u00a0m) struck the coastline from Nova Scotia to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico. In portions of New England, the damage was worse than that caused by Hurricane Bob two months earlier.  Aside from tidal flooding along rivers, the storm's effects were primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of 100.7 feet (30.7\u00a0m), the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In Massachusetts, where damage was heaviest, over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. To the north, more than 100 homes were affected in Maine, including the vacation home of then-President George H. W. Bush. More than 38,000 people were left without power, and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings. Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued and one died. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The Perfect Storm originated from a cold front that exited the east coast of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29, with the storm completely absorbing Grace by the next day.[3] The cyclone significantly strengthened as a result of the temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest, and the warmth and moisture from the remnants of Grace. The low-pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States.[3] It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years.[4] Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.[5] While situated about 390 miles (630\u00a0km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of up to 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h).[3] The nor'easter reached peak intensity at approximately 12:00 UTC on October 30 with its lowest pressure of 972 millibars. The interaction between the extratropical storm and the high pressure system to its north created a significant pressure gradient, which created large waves and strong winds.[3] Between the southern New England coast and the storm's center, the pressure differential was 70\u00a0mbar (2.1\u00a0inHg).[6] A buoy located 264 miles (425\u00a0km) south of Halifax reported a wave height of 100.7 feet (30.7\u00a0m) on October 30. This became the highest recorded wave height on the Scotian Shelf, which is the oceanic shelf off the coast of Nova Scotia.[7] East of Cape Cod, a NOAA buoy located at 41\u00b006\u2032N 66\u00b036\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff41.1\u00b0N 66.6\u00b0W\ufeff / 41.1; -66.6 reported maximum sustained winds of 56\u00a0mph (90\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h), and a significant wave height (average height of the highest one-third of all waves) of 39 feet (12\u00a0m) around 15:00 UTC on October 30. Another buoy, located at 40\u00b030\u2032N 69\u00b030\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff40.5\u00b0N 69.5\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.5; -69.5, reported maximum sustained winds of 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h) with gusts to 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) and a significant wave height of 31 feet (9.4\u00a0m) near 00:00 UTC on October 31.[3] Upon peaking in intensity, the nor'easter turned southward and gradually weakened; by November 1, its pressure had risen to 998 millibars (29.5\u00a0inHg). The low moved over warm waters of the Gulf Stream, where bands of convection around the center began to organize.[8] Around this time, the system attained subtropical characteristics. On November 1, while the storm was moving in a counter-clockwise loop, a tropical cyclone had been identified at the center of the larger low.[9] (Although these conditions are rare, Hurricane Karl during 1980 formed within a larger non-tropical weather system.)[10] By around 14:00 UTC on November 1, an eye feature was forming, and the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75\u00a0mph (121\u00a0km/h);[11][12] these estimates, combined with reports from an Air Force Reserve Unit flight into the storm and confirmation that a warm-core center was present, indicated that the system had become a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane accelerated toward the northeast and quickly weakened back into a tropical storm. It made landfall near Halifax, Nova Scotia, at 14:00 UTC on November 2, with sustained winds of 45\u00a0mph (72\u00a0km/h). While the storm was approaching the coast, weather radars depicted curved rainbands on the western side of the system.[9] After crossing over Prince Edward Island,[7] the storm fully dissipated late on November 2.[9]",
      "Preparations and naming[edit]": "For several days, weather models forecast the development of a significant storm off New England.[6] However, the models were inadequate in forecasting coastal conditions, which in one instance failed to provide adequate warning. In addition, a post-storm assessment found an insufficient number of observation sites along the coast.[13] On October 27, the Ocean Prediction Center noted that a \"dangerous storm\" would form within 36 hours, with its wording emphasizing the unusual nature of the storm.[14] The National Weather Service likewise issued warnings for the potential storm, providing information to emergency service offices as well as the media.[13] The public however was skeptical and did not recognize the threat.[4][13] The timely warnings ultimately lowered the death toll;[13] whereas the Perfect Storm caused 13 deaths, the blizzard of 1978 killed 99 people, and the 1938 New England hurricane killed 564 people.[6] From Massachusetts to Maine, thousands of people evacuated their homes and sought shelter.[15] A state of emergency was declared for nine counties in Massachusetts, including Suffolk County, as well as two in Maine.[5][16] In North Carolina, the National Weather Service offices in Hatteras and Raleigh first issued a heavy surf advisory on October 27, more than eight hours before the first reports of high waves. That same day, a coastal flood watch and later a warning was issued, along with a gale warning. The Hatteras NWS office ultimately released 19 coastal flood statements, as well as media reports explaining the threat from the wind and waves, and a state of emergency was declared for Dare County, North Carolina.[15] The warnings and lead times in the region were described as \"very good\".[17] In Canada, the threat from the storm prompted the cancellation of ferry service from Bar Harbor, Maine, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, as well as from Nova Scotia to Prince Edward Island and between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.[7] In its tropical cyclone report on the hurricane, the National Hurricane Center only referred to the system as \"Unnamed Hurricane\".[8] The Natural Disaster Survey Report called the storm \"The Halloween Nor'easter of 1991\".[6] The \"perfect storm\" moniker was coined by author and journalist Sebastian Junger after a conversation with NWS Boston Deputy Meteorologist Robert Case in which Case described the convergence of weather conditions as being \"perfect\" for the formation of such a storm.[4]  Other National Weather Service offices were tasked with issuing warnings for this storm in lieu of the typical NHC advisories.  The OPC posted warnings on the unnamed hurricane in its High Seas Forecasts.[14] The National Weather Service State Forecast Office in Boston issued Offshore Marine Forecasts for the storm.  Local NWS offices along the East coast covered the storm in their Coastal Waters Forecasts.[18] Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane was reported to have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season.[9][19] Had the system been named instead, it would have received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.[20]",
      "Impact[edit]": "The Halloween Storm of 1991 left significant damage along the east coast of the United States, primarily in Massachusetts and southern New Jersey. Across seven states, damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD).[2] Over a three-day period, the storm lashed the northeastern United States with high waves,[6] causing damage to beachfront properties from North Carolina to Maine.[13] The coastal flooding damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and closed roads and airports.[3] In addition, high winds left about 38,000 people without power. The total without power was much less than for Hurricane Bob two months prior, and was fairly low due to little rainfall and the general lack of leaves on trees.[16] Overall there were thirteen confirmed deaths,[6][7] including six on board Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat. The vessel departed Gloucester, Massachusetts, for the waters off Nova Scotia. After encountering high seas in the middle of the storm, the vessel made its last radio contact late on October 28, about 180 miles (290\u00a0km) northeast of Sable Island. Andrea Gail sank while returning to Gloucester, her debris washing ashore over the subsequent weeks. The crew of six was presumed killed after a Coast Guard search was unable to find them. The storm and the boat's sinking became the center-piece for Sebastian Junger's best-selling non-fiction book The Perfect Storm (1997), which was adapted to a major Hollywood film in 2000 as The Perfect Storm starring George Clooney.[3][21] Despite the storm's severity, it was neither the costliest nor the strongest to affect the northeastern United States. It was weakening as it made its closest approach to land, and the highest tides occurred during the neap tide, which is the time when tide ranges are minimal.[6] The worst of the storm effects stayed offshore. A buoy 650 miles (1,050\u00a0km) northeast of Nantucket, which was 60 miles (97\u00a0km) west of Andrea Gail's last known position, recorded a 73\u00a0ft (22\u00a0m) rise in wave height in 10 hours while the extratropical storm was still rapidly intensifying. Two buoys near the Massachusetts coast observed record wave heights, and one observed a record wind report.[6] The United States Coast Guard rescued 25 people at sea at the height of the storm,[22] including 13 people from Long Island Sound.[5] A New York Air National Guard Sikorsky HH-60G helicopter of the 106th Air Rescue Wing ditched during the storm, 90 miles (140\u00a0km) south of Montauk, New York, after it was unable to refuel in flight and ran out of fuel. After the helicopter had attempted a rescue in the midst of the storm, an 84-person crew on the Coast Guard Cutter Tamaroa arrived and rescued four members of the crew of five after six hours in hypothermic waters. The survivors were pilots, Major Christopher David Ruvola and Captain Graham Buschor, flight engineer Staff Sergeant James R. Mioli, and pararescue jumper Technical Sergeant John Spillane. The fifth member, pararescue jumper Technical Sergeant Arden Richard Smith, was never found.[23] They were all featured on the show I Shouldn't Be Alive.[5][16][24] Following the storm's damage, President George H. W. Bush declared five counties in Maine, seven counties in Massachusetts, and Rockingham County, New Hampshire to be disaster areas.[2] The declaration allowed for the affected residents to apply for low-interest repair loans.[25] New Jersey governor Jim Florio requested a declaration for portions of the coastline, but the request was denied because of the funding needs of other disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo, Hurricane Bob, and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.[26] The American Red Cross opened service centers in four locations in Massachusetts to assist the storm victims by providing food, clothing, medicine, and shelter. The agency deployed five vehicles carrying cleanup units and food, and allocated $1.4 million to provide assistance to 3,000 families.[25]",
      "New England and Atlantic Canada[edit]": "Along the Massachusetts coastline, the storm produced 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m) wave heights on top of a 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) high tide.[2] In Boston, the highest tide was 14.3\u00a0ft (4.4\u00a0m),[6] which was only 1\u00a0ft (30\u00a0cm) lower than the record from the blizzard of 1978.[2] High waves on top of the storm tide reached about 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m). The storm produced heavy rainfall in southeastern Massachusetts, peaking at 5.5 inches (140\u00a0mm).[6] Coastal floods closed several roads, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. In addition to the high tides, the storm produced strong winds; Chatham recorded a gust of 78\u00a0mph (126\u00a0km/h). Damage was worst from Cape Ann in northeastern Massachusetts to Nantucket, with over 100 homes destroyed or severely damaged at Marshfield, Minot Beach in Scituate, and Brant Point. There were two injuries in the state, although there were no fatalities. Across Massachusetts, damage totaled in the hundreds of millions of dollars.[2] Elsewhere in New England, waves up to 30\u00a0ft (9.1\u00a0m) reached as far north as Maine,[2] along with tides that were 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal.[22] Significant flooding was reported in that state, along with high winds that left areas without power. A total of 49 houses were severely damaged, 2 were destroyed,[2] and overall more than 100 were affected.[27] In Kennebunkport, the storm blew out windows and flooded the vacation home of then-President George H. W. Bush.[3] The home sustained significant damage to its first floor.[28] In Portland, tides were 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m) above normal, among the ten highest tides since record-keeping began in 1914. Along the coast, damage was worse than that caused by Hurricane Bob two months prior.[27] Across Maine, the storm left $7.9 million (1991 USD) in damage,[2] mostly in York County.[27] More than half of the damage total was from property damage, with the remainder to transportation, seawalls, and public facilities.[27] Although there were no deaths, there were two injuries in the state. In neighboring New Hampshire, coastal flooding affected several towns, destroying two homes. The storm destroyed three boats and damaged a lighthouse.[2] High waves destroyed or swept away over 50,000 lobster traps, representing $2 million in losses (1991 USD).[29] Damage was estimated at $5.6 million (1991 USD).[2] Further west, high winds and coastal flooding lashed the Rhode Island and Connecticut coasts, killing a man in Narragansett, Rhode Island. Winds reached 63 miles per hour (101\u00a0km/h) in Newport, Rhode Island, causing power outages.[2] Off the coast of Atlantic Canada, the storm produced very high waves, flooding a ship near Sable Island and stranding another ship. Along the coast, the waves wrecked three small boats near Tiverton, Nova Scotia, as well as nine boats in Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador. In Nova Scotia, where the storm made landfall, precipitation reached 1.18 in (30\u00a0mm), and 20,000 people in Pictou County were left without power. The storm also caused widespread power outages in Newfoundland from its high winds, which reached 68\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) near St. Lawrence. There were at least 35 traffic accidents, one fatal, in Grand Falls-Windsor due to slick roads. On October 28, prior to the nor'easter's development into a subtropical storm, a record 4.4 in (116\u00a0mm) of snowfall was recorded across Newfoundland.[7] The storm caused no significant damage in Canada, other than these traffic accidents.[30]",
      "Mid-Atlantic states[edit]": "In New York and northern New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him.[2] High waves flooded the beach at Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate.[5] Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding.[3] Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion,[2] with 500,000 cubic yards (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas.[26] There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk.[5] Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was a moratorium on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters.[26] Along the Delmarva Peninsula and Virginia Beach, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in the Sandbridge Beach area of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of 7.8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m), while elsewhere the tides were similar to the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962.[2]",
      "Farther south[edit]": "In North Carolina along the Outer Banks, high waves were initially caused by Hurricane Grace and later its interaction with a high pressure system. This produced gale-force winds and 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) waves in the town of Duck. Later, the extratropical predecessor to the unnamed hurricane produced additional high waves, causing oceanfront flooding from Cape Hatteras through the northern portions of Currituck County. Flooding was first reported on October 28, when the ocean covered a portion of North Carolina Highway 12 north of Rodanthe;[17] the route is the primary thoroughfare in the Outer Banks.[22] Nags Head, Kitty Hawk, and Kill Devil Hills had large portions covered with water for several blocks away from the beach. The resultant flooding damaged 525 houses and 28 businesses and destroyed two motels and a few homes.[17] Damage was estimated at $6.7 million (1991 USD).[2] Farther south, the storm left 14 people injured in Florida. There was minor beach erosion and flooding, which damaged two houses and destroyed the pier at Lake Worth.[2] In some locations, beaches gained additional sand from the wave action.[31] Two people went missing off Daytona Beach after their boat lost power.[5] High waves destroyed a portion of State Road A1A.[32] Damage in the state was estimated at $3 million (1991 USD).[2] High waves also affected Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic.[3] In Puerto Rico, waves of 15\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) affected the island's north coast, which prompted 32 people to seek shelter. The waves swept a person off a large rock to his death.[2]",

      "Tropical Storm Marco (2008)": "Tropical Storm Marco was one of the smallest tropical cyclones on record by radius of winds from center.[1] The thirteenth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean during late September 2008. Influenced by a tropical wave on October\u00a04, a small low-level circulation center developed over Belize. After crossing the southern end of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche, the low was declared Tropical Depression Thirteen early on October\u00a06. The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Marco later that day. Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) early on October\u00a07. Around this time, tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles (18.5\u00a0km) from the center of the storm, making Marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record.[2][1] Around 1200\u00a0UTC, Marco made landfall near Misantla, Veracruz. The storm rapidly weakened after landfall, dissipating later that day. Due to its small size, Marco caused minimal damage; however, the storm's heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet (3.05\u00a0m) deep that covered highways and damaged homes.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Tropical Storm Marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern Caribbean in early October, 2008. On October\u00a04, a tropical wave reached the same area, and the system spawned a circulation center over Belize. Development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land. As the system neared the Bay of Campeche, convection quickly developed around the low. At 00:00\u00a0UTC on October\u00a06, the low was designated as Tropical Depression Thirteen while located over Laguna de T\u00e9rminos.[1] A mid-level ridge located to the north of the depression led to movement in a general west-northwest direction. Forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storm's well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path.[3] By 12:00\u00a0UTC, the small cyclone, with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles (137 kilometers) across, was upgraded to Tropical Storm Marco.[1] Favorable conditions for development allowed Marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on October\u00a06. Early on October\u00a07, Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) and a minimum pressure of 998\u00a0millibar (hPa; 29.47\u00a0inHg).[1] This was based on a reconnaissance mission into Marco which recorded flight-level winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61\u00a0mph (98\u00a0km/h). Following the quick increase in intensity, forecasters noted the possibility of Marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall.[4] The storm maintained a small area of deep convection, averaging 9.2 miles (14.8\u00a0km) in diameter, as it continued moving towards the west-northwest.[5] Shortly after reaching peak intensity, tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles (18.5\u00a0km) from the center of Marco.[6] At 12:00\u00a0UTC, the center of Marco made landfall near Misantla, Veracruz, with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h).[1] Once inland, Marco rapidly weakened,[7] being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall. The small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of Mexico.[1]",
      "Preparations, impact, and records[edit]": "Upon the storm's formation, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the Gulf of Mexico from Tuxpan to Punta El Lagarto.[8] That afternoon the government issued a hurricane watch between Cabo Rojo and Veracruz, and extended the tropical storm warning northward to Cabo Rojo.[9] Officials closed schools ahead of the storm and opened 200 shelters.[10] An estimated 3,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas along the coast.[11] Soldiers used school buses to transport evacuees to the shelters.[10]  Marco formed in the area of Mexico's main oil-facilities,[12] leading to the evacuation of 33 workers from four platforms. Six oil wells and a natural gas processing plant were also shut down in Veracruz. The Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transportation also closed the ports of Nautla and Alvarado to small vessels as a precautionary measure.[10] Upon landfall, heavy rains peaking at 7.9 inches (201 millimeters) in El Pujal, San Luis Potos\u00ed[13] and falling at rates up to 1\u00a0inch per hour (25.4\u00a0mm/h),[1] caused some flooding in coastal towns near Veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground.[14] The rains from Marco worsened flood situations in areas of Mexico already suffering from severe flooding.[10] Officials in Veracruz, in their post-storm damage survey, reported that two rivers, the Quilate and Tenoch, overflowed their banks due to rains produced by Marco.[15] One of these rivers left the towns of Minatitlan and Hidalgotitlan under 10\u00a0ft (3\u00a0m) of water.[10] Highways along the coast of Veracruz were also flooded.[16] Another 250 homes were flooded when a lake and a river overflowed their banks.[17] Thirteen municipalities within Veracruz were affected by Marco. In Vega de Alatorre, 77 people were evacuated to nearby shelters after their homes were inundated with water. Three landslides were also reported in Misantla Colipa; none of them caused damage.[18] In all, Marco's impact was light; minimal damage was recorded, and none of the estimated 400,000 people affected by the storm  sustained injury.[1][19] In the wake of Marco, the General Coordination of Civil Protection of the Ministry of the Interior declared a state of emergency for 48 municipalities in Veracruz.[20][21][22] Relief goods were distributed to the affected areas by October\u00a09. The Government of Mexico reported that 4,700 blankets, 2,900 mattresses, 5,554 bottles of water (each containing 500\u00a0milliliters), 260,000 boxes of milk, 250,000 packages of biscuits, and 12,400 boxes of school supplies had been distributed.[23] At 0052\u00a0UTC on October\u00a07, tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles (18.5\u00a0km) from the center of Marco. This made Marco the smallest tropical cyclone ever recorded, surpassing the previous record set on December\u00a024, 1974 by Cyclone Tracy, whose  tropical storm-force winds extended 30 miles (48\u00a0km).[2][1][24]",

      "Hurricane Gladys (1975)": " Hurricane Gladys was the farthest tropical cyclone from the United States to be observed by radar in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Carla in 1961.[1] The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season, Gladys developed from a tropical wave while several hundred miles southwest of Cape Verde on September\u00a022. Initially, the tropical depression failed to strengthen significantly, but due to warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, it became Tropical Storm Gladys by September\u00a024. Despite entering a more unfavorable environment several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, Gladys became a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale on September\u00a028. Shortly thereafter, the storm reentered an area favorable for strengthening. Eventually, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery. As the storm tracked to the east of the Bahamas, a curve to the north began, at which time an anticyclone developed atop the cyclone. This subsequently allowed Gladys to rapidly intensify into a Category\u00a04 hurricane, reaching maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) on October\u00a02. Thereafter, Gladys began to weaken and passed very close to Cape Race, Newfoundland before merging with a large extratropical cyclone the next day. Effects from the system along the East Coast of the United States were minimal, although heavy rainfall and rough seas were reported. In Newfoundland, strong winds and light precipitation were observed.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On September 17, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Africa. The disturbance followed another tropical wave which became Hurricane Faye several days later, before turning west near the 11th parallel. Based on estimates from the Dvorak Technique, the wave was designated a tropical depression at 18:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a022. Due to favorable conditions such as low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Gladys by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) on September\u00a024.[2] After becoming a tropical storm, Gladys slowly intensified as winds increased to 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h). The storm then moved west-northwest, and on September\u00a025, Gladys strengthened into a Category\u00a01 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).[3] Despite strong wind shear,[2] the storm maintained minimal hurricane status.[3] However, early on September\u00a028, the barometric pressure increased to 1,000\u00a0mb (30\u00a0inHg); the NHC notes that Gladys may have briefly weakened into a tropical storm at this time.[2] After passing through the trough that generated the wind shear, the storm began to strengthen again.[2] While moving about 350 miles (560\u00a0km) north of Puerto Rico on September\u00a030, the winds of the storm increased to 90\u00a0mph (140\u00a0km/h).[3] By this time, an eye was clearly visible on satellite imagery. After holding steady for 36\u00a0hours, the storm recurved around a ridge on October\u00a01. Gladys then began to undergo rapid deepening,[2] becoming a Category\u00a02 hurricane at 18:00\u00a0UTC and Category\u00a03 hurricane the following day. Early on October\u00a02, the storm strengthened into a Category\u00a04 hurricane.[3] At 08:46\u00a0UTC on October\u00a02, Hurricane Hunters measured maximum sustained winds of 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 939\u00a0mbar (27.7\u00a0inHg).[2] Moving northeast,[3] the hurricane hunters soon observed a pressure of 940\u00a0mbar (28\u00a0inHg), making it one of the most intense high-latitude storms ever observed. Despite its distance from Cape Hatteras, the system was briefly observed on radar. It became one of few hurricanes at the time to be seen on radar over 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) from the continental United States.[2] Thereafter, the storm weakened slightly, and was downgraded to a Category\u00a03 hurricane early on October\u00a03.[3] Accelerating at unusually high speeds, Gladys passed 70 miles (110\u00a0km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland on October\u00a03. The storm finally merged with a large extratropical cyclone on October\u00a04.[2]",
      "Observation, preparations and impact[edit]": "While over the Atlantic Ocean, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) C-130 hurricane hunter aircraft flew into Gladys on October 1 on a research mission. The mission was to study the storm and use the information to improve seeding operations for the now-defunct Project Stormfury.[4][5] Gladys was the strongest storm to threaten the East Coast of the United States since Hurricane Hazel in 1954.[2] Although initially not expected to threaten,[6] meteorologists at the NHC forecast the storm to make landfall along the East Coast of the United States within three days.[7] A hurricane watch was issued for North Carolina's Outer Banks on October\u00a01,[8] extending from Cape Lookout to Kitty Hawk.[2] However, the watch discontinued as Gladys pulled away,[9] though the storm was still considered a threat to the nation.[10] In Manteo, residents began laying sandbags and filling their cars up with fuel in anticipation for possible evacuation, and the United States Coast Guard sent a plane equipped with a loudspeaker to warn fishermen of the hurricane.[11] However, despite warnings, about 40\u00a0fishermen went to Cape Point near Cape Hatteras due to the \"increased feeding activities\" of fish during rough seas.[12] All small crafts were advised to stay out of the water.[13] \nElsewhere in the Outer Banks, residents evacuated to hotels in Elizabeth City and four United States Coast Guard servicemen stationed at a lighthouse in Cape Hatteras were evacuated.[14] While passing the Outer Banks, a campground and road was closed due to 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) waves. As the cyclone moved northward. In all, the effects of the storm on North Carolina were minimal.[2] While tracking rapidly to the southeast of Newfoundland, light rainfall was observed, including 1.46\u00a0in (37\u00a0mm) of precipitation in St. John's.[15] Strong winds were also reported on the island.[2]",

      "1944 Great Atlantic hurricane": " The 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane was a destructive and powerful tropical cyclone that swept across a large portion of the United States East Coast in September\u00a01944. New England was most affected, though so were the Outer Banks, Mid-Atlantic states, and the Canadian Maritimes. The storm's ferocity and path drew comparisons to the 1938 Long Island Express, one of the worst storms in New England history. Its precursor was first identified well east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a04, but the disturbance only became well organized enough to be considered a tropical cyclone on September\u00a09 northeast of the Virgin Islands. Tracking west-northwest, the storm gradually intensified, curved northward, and reached peak intensity as a Category\u00a05 hurricane on September\u00a013 north of the Bahamas. A day later, the storm passed the Outer Banks and later made landfall on Long Island and Rhode Island as a weaker hurricane on September\u00a015. The storm eventually became an extratropical cyclone, moving northeast, and merged with another extratropical system off Greenland on September\u00a016.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The origins of the 1944\u00a0hurricane can be traced back to a tropical wave first identified well east of the Lesser Antilles on September\u00a04. Over the next few days, the disturbance slowly traversed west-northwestward without producing any significant weather that would hint at tropical cyclogenesis. On September\u00a07, an area of low pressure, albeit disorganized, formed in association with the tropical wave east of Barbados.[1] The following day, the barometric depression became more well-defined, prompting the Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico to issue advisories on the tropical disturbance. As a result of the sparseness of available surface observations east of the Lesser Antilles, a reconnaissance flight was dispatched to investigate the storm late on September\u00a09; the flight reported that the disturbance had strengthened into a newly formed but fully-fledged hurricane.[2] Due to the seemingly rapid development of the storm, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project concluded that the storm likely began earlier and as a weaker system; thus, HURDAT\u2014the official track database for hurricanes in the North Atlantic dating back to 1851\u2014lists the tropical cyclone as having begun a tropical storm with winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a09.[3] After formation, the tropical cyclone gradually intensified as it slowly moved west-northwestward, reaching the threshold for hurricane intensity at 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a010 while north of the Virgin Islands. Strengthening continued thereafter, and by September\u00a012, the storm reached an intensity equivalent to a Category\u00a03\u00a0hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale. Later that day, the cyclone strengthened further into a Category\u00a04-equivalent and was given the moniker of \"Great Atlantic hurricane\" by the Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida.[2][3] Concurrently, the tropical cyclone began to curve and accelerate towards the north.[2] At 06:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a013, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h),[3], and five hours later, a ship in the eye documented a minimum barometric pressure of 919\u00a0mbar (hPa; 27.14\u00a0inHg) alongside 15-knot (17\u00a0mph; 28\u00a0km/h) winds, suggesting a central pressure of 918\u00a0mbar (918\u00a0hPa; 27.1\u00a0inHg). The storm's pressure may have been lower during its lifespan, though the 909\u00a0mbar (909\u00a0hPa; 26.8\u00a0inHg) pressure suggested by meteorologist Ivan Ray Tannehill was considered too low.[1] The hurricane began to gradually weaken after reaching peak intensity on September\u00a013.[3] In the morning hours of September\u00a014,[2] the storm passed just east of Cape Hatteras and eastern Virginia as a small but powerful hurricane with winds of 125\u00a0mph (201\u00a0km/h).[1] Afterwards, the cyclone curved slightly further towards the northeast and continued to accelerate;[2] at 02:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a015, the hurricane made landfall near Southampton in eastern Long Island with winds of 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h).[1] The storm then crossed the island and Long Island Sound before making a second landfall two hours later near Point Judith, Rhode Island as a slightly weaker storm with winds of 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h).[1][2] After crossing Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the tropical system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of Maine on September\u00a015;[1] these extratropical remnants continued to track towards the northeast and across the Canadian Maritimes before they were last noted merging with another extratropical cyclone off of Greenland at 12:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a016.[2][3]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "Upon being designated a tropical cyclone, the Weather Bureau began advising extreme caution to shipping within the expected path of the hurricane.[4] Precaution was also urged in the eastern Bahamas.[5] The first hurricane warning issued by the Weather Bureau in association with the storm was for the northern Bahamas on September\u00a012. In Miami, Florida, the American Red Cross began preparing its resources for a potential regional calamity; however, the Weather Bureau did not necessarily anticipate the storm striking Miami.[6] Royal Air Force aircraft stationed in Nassau were flown to Miami in order to avoid the storm.[7] Although tropical cyclone naming was not in practice at the time,[8] the Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida, began naming the system the \"Great Atlantic hurricane\" in their public advisories on September\u00a012 to better convey the life-threatening risks associated with the powerful hurricane.[2] The following day, storm warnings were issued for areas from the United States East Coast from Savannah, Georgia to Cape Hatteras. Small craft in offshore areas further south were advised to remain in port.[9] As Morehead City, North Carolina was forecast to be submerged under several feet of water, the city's entire population was evacuated; other resort locales along the coast of North Carolina were also evacuated. Similarly, the 3000\u20134000\u00a0personnel constituting Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point were evacuated inland; U.S. Army and Navy aircraft were also sent inland.[10] As the hurricane was passing near the Outer Banks, hurricane warnings were extended as far north as Portland, Maine, and storm warnings were issued as far north as Eastport, Maine.[11] Precautions across New England and Mid-Atlantic states began in earnest once the storm began tracking northwards. Sixty buses were readied in Ocean City, Maryland to evacuate the seaside resort's permanent and tourist residents.[12] The 3,000\u00a0residents of Fire Island, one of the barrier islands off of Long Island, were ordered to evacuate the islet. Nearby, the Brooklyn Red Cross Chapter began readying for possible relief work, stocking five mobile canteens with emergency rations.[13] The United States First Naval District were directed to have personnel and rescue craft on standby to respond to emergencies. The Massachusetts State Police began relaying Weather Bureau bulletins to local public services via telecommunications. Personnel on duty were called back to barracks for later deployment in relief operations.[11] The Massachusetts National Guard were ordered to standby and prepare for potential assistance of regional emergency services.[14] Other Massachusetts state agencies were also allocating resources to aid in relief operations.[11]",

      "North Carolina[edit]": "The hurricane passed east of North Carolina on the morning of September\u00a014; while stronger winds prevailed offshore, parts of the North Carolina coast experienced Category 2 hurricane conditions according to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project.[15]:\u200a72\u200a The peak sustained winds in the state were estimated by the project to have reached approximately 105\u00a0mph (165\u00a0km/h), with the high winds punctuated by higher gusts. The highest reported wind speeds in the state occurred at Hatteras, where 5-minute sustained winds peaked at an estimated 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h).[1] With the eye remaining mostly offshore, the resulting impacts of the hurricane in the state were limited to areas east of the 77th meridian west.[15]:\u200a72\u200a[16] The hurricane inflicted about $1\u00a0million in crop damage and $450,000 in property damage in North Carolina, with wind-related impacts accounting for most of the damage toll.[16] More than 600\u00a0buildings were damaged in the central and northern coastal areas of the state, of which 108 were destroyed.[17] The Weather Bureau enumerated 3,279\u00a0damaged buildings and 389\u00a0destroyed buildings across the state.[2]:\u200a189\u200a Telecommunications were also disrupted throughout the North Carolina coast between Morehead City and the state border with Virginia.[18]:\u200a1\u200a One person was killed and 28 were injured statewide.[2]:\u200a185 The Outer Banks were particularly hard-hit by the passing storm; while the strong southeasterly winds accompanying the hurricane's approach pushed water from Pamlico Sound westward, opposing winds that followed the storm's passage caused the backed up water to surge back east, flooding villages in the Outer Banks.[15]:\u200a73\u200a Storm surge along unprotected coastline destroyed hundreds of boats, damaged boardwalks, and deposited debris along the Carolina beaches.[13] At Hatteras, the tide level crested at 7\u00a0ft (2.1\u00a0m) above the mean low tide.[2]:\u200a189\u200a The raised seas inundated coastal farmland and homes with 2\u20134\u00a0ft (0.61\u20131.22\u00a0m) of water.[13][15]:\u200a73\u200a At Avon, this surge of water accumulated between sand barriers surrounding the community, separating homes from their foundations and sending them adrift; 96\u00a0homes in Avon either sustained severe damage or were washed away.[15]:\u200a73\u201374\u200a Rodanthe was also hard-hit, with the storm destroying the community's cistern water systems destroyed and leaving only two of its homes standing.[19] At Roanoke Island, the storm tides reached 1\u00a0ft (0.30\u00a0m) higher than any previous storm on record there. Manteo was inundated under 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) of water while Wanchese at the southern end of the island experienced tides reaching 10\u00a0ft (3.0\u00a0m).[20]:\u200a1\u200a The island was also subjected to wind gusts as strong as 120\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h), contributing to widespread damage to homes and transportation infrastructure.[21] Many summer cottages along the beach at Nags Head were unroofed and all telecommunications and power lines along a 15\u00a0mi (24\u00a0km) stretch of the beach were blown down. One person was killed at Nags Head after being electrocuted by a fallen power line. Surge and winds washed out 3,000\u00a0ft (910\u00a0m) of pavement along the causeway connecting  Roanoke Island and the North Carolina mainland; a second bridge crossing the same stretch of water was also heavily damaged.[20]:\u200a7\u200a[21]:\u200a9\u200a A towed barge was set adrift during the storm and collided with another highway bridge crossing an inland waterway at Coinjock, severely damaging the bridge.[21]:\u200a9\u200a Gusts at Cape Hatteras reached approximately 110\u00a0mph (180\u00a0km/h),[15]:\u200a74\u200a with the accompanying sustained winds reaching record-high velocities at Hatteras.[2]:\u200a189 Winds of around 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h) brought down power and telephone lines in the Elizabeth City area,[22] leaving the city without power for 10\u00a0hours.[23] The strong winds razed homes in the region and along nearby beaches, though no deaths or injuries resulted from the hurricane's forces there.[18]:\u200a1\u200a The winds also broke aircraft away from their moorings at a Consolidated Vultee airbase.[23] The Elizabeth City area incurred around $25,000 in damage while nearby Edenton incurred $10,000 in damage.[22] Substantial crop damage occurred around the Albermarle area.[23] Homes were unroofed as far south as Morehead City; trees and business signage in the city were also blown down by the winds.[23] Power outages impacted New Bern, North Carolina.[12]",
      "Virginia[edit]": "The passing hurricane brought Category\u00a02 hurricane conditions to eastern Virginia.[1] Five-minute sustained winds at Cape Henry topped out at 86\u00a0mph (139\u00a0km/h) while one-minute sustained winds topped out at 128\u00a0mph (206\u00a0km/h), though the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory assessed that the latter value was not in concordance with other observations or may have been \"atypical of the circulation of the hurricane\".[1] A wind measurement of 134\u00a0mph (216\u00a0km/h) at Cape Henry nonetheless set a record for the region as the strongest winds measured within both the region and for the state of Virginia overall.[24] Gusts at Cape Henry may have reached as high as 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h).[25] A $5\u00a0million damage toll inflicted upon crops and a $1\u00a0million damage toll inflicted upon property comprised the $6\u00a0million damage toll resulting from the hurricane's impacts in Virginia.[26] The hurricane damaged 2,132\u00a0buildings and destroyed another 31 according to the Weather Bureau.[2]:\u200a189 The Richmond Times-Dispatch described the storm as one of \"unusual violence\". Wind gusts in the Hampton Roads area exceeded 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h). The Norfolk and Virginia Beach areas were the hardest-hit locales in Virginia. Homes were damaged and telephone and power networks were disrupted in the two cities. The primary power line connecting Norfolk and Virginia Beach was knocked out, along with a Virginia Electric and Power Commission substation in Suffolk. The 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) transmission tower for the WSAP radio station in Portsmouth was blown down by the hurricane. The scale of the damage was relatively minor in Gloucester and Matthews counties, though the high tides raised by the passing storm forced coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground.[27]",
      "New Jersey Shore[edit]": "The hurricane was infamous for the amount of damage it caused along the New Jersey coastline. The shore towns on Long Beach Island, as well as Barnegat, Atlantic City, Ocean City, and Cape May all suffered major damage. Long Beach Island, Barnegat Island and Brigantine all lost their causeways to the mainland in the storm effectively cutting them off from the rest of New Jersey. Additionally both islands lost hundreds of homes, in particular the Harvey Cedars section of Long Beach Island where many homes in the town were swept out to sea. In Atlantic City the hurricane's storm surge forced water into the lobbies of many of the resorts' famous hotels. The Atlantic City boardwalk suffered major damage along with the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ and the city's famous ocean piers. Both the famed Steel Pier and Heinz Pier were partially destroyed by the hurricane with only the Steel Pier getting rebuilt. Ocean City and Cape May also lost many homes in the storm with Ocean City's boardwalk suffering significant damage. Larry Savadove devotes a whole chapter in his book Great Storms of the Jersey Shore to the hurricane and the imprint and lore it left on the Jersey Shore.[citation needed]",
      "New England[edit]": "Rain totals of around 7 inches (180\u00a0mm) occurred in the Hartford, Connecticut area, and the city of Bridgeport saw the greatest official total at 10.7 inches (270\u00a0mm). Tobacco and fruit damage in Connecticut totaled to about $2\u00a0million (1944 USD), with similar overall damage costs occurring in Rhode Island. More than $5\u00a0million (1944 USD) in damage which occurred on Cape Cod can be attributed to lost boats, as well as fallen trees and utility damage.[28] A total of 28 people died throughout New England as a result of the storm. In Bath, Maine, a 10-year-old boy was electrocuted when he came into contact with downed wires. In Augusta, Maine, a 40-year-old woman was run over by a bicyclist who was blinded by heavy rains. 4.34\u00a0inches of rain fell during the storm at Bates College. Many tree limbs were downed by high winds during the storm, and in Androscoggin County, Maine, 40% of the apple crop was destroyed.[29] Hey Bonnie Hall, the mansion built by Russell Warren for the DeWolf family in Bristol, Rhode Island, was damaged beyond repair and demolished later in 1944.[30]",
      "USS Warrington and other ships[edit]": "The storm was also responsible for sinking the Navy destroyer USS\u00a0Warrington approximately 450 miles (720\u00a0km) east of Vero Beach, Florida, with a loss of 248 sailors. The hurricane was one of the most powerful to traverse the Eastern Seaboard, reaching Category\u00a04 when it encountered Warrington, and producing hurricane-force winds over a diameter of 600 miles (970\u00a0km).[31] The hurricane also produced waves in excess of 70 feet (21\u00a0m) in height. The hurricane and the sinking of USS Warrington are documented in the 1996 book The Dragon's Breath - Hurricane At Sea, written by Commander Robert A. Dawes, Jr. (a former Commanding Officer of Warrington), and published by Naval Institute Press. In addition to Warrington, the Coast Guard cutters USCGC Bedloe (WSC-128) and USCGC Jackson (WSC-142) both capsized and sank off Cape Hatteras. Seventy-five men managed to escape onto life rafts from Bedloe and Jackson, but only 32 survived the rough seas and subsequent hours of exposure to be rescued two days later.[32] The 136-foot (41\u00a0m) minesweeper YMS-409 foundered and sank killing all 33 on board, while the lightship Vineyard Sound (LV-73) was sunk with the loss of all twelve aboard.[33] YAG-17, a full sized attack transport simulator permanently moored in Lynnhaven Roads, near Little Creek, Virginia, was wrecked.[34] Finally, the hurricane drove the SS Thomas Tracy aground in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.",

      "Contents": "",
      "Cyclone Hikaa": "Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Hikaa was a tropical cyclone that struck eastern Oman in September 2019. The third named storm of the 2019 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Hikaa formed on September\u00a022 west of India in the Arabian Sea. The storm reached peak intensity on September\u00a024, with maximum sustained winds estimated over 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph). Later that day, the storm made landfall in eastern Oman south of Duqm, and quickly dissipated over the Arabian Peninsula. The name Hikaa was named by Maldives, which refers to the 'scorpion' in Maldivian.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "An area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted along the west coast of India on September\u00a019.[1] A distinct low-pressure area developed a day later off the coast of Maharashtra.[2] By September\u00a021, a circulation was consolidating within the system, located east of the heaviest convection. The system moved slowly westward across the Arabian Sea, steered by a ridge to north. Warm water temperatures favored further development, despite moderate wind shear.[3] Early on September\u00a022, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression, and soon upgraded it to a deep depression.[2] Late on September\u00a022, the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system, designating it Tropical Cyclone 03A. At the time, the storm had a compact area of thunderstorms, supported by outflow from the south.[4] Due to decreasing wind shear and warm, moist air, the system quickly intensified on September\u00a023, prompting the IMD to upgrade the system to Cyclonic Storm Hikaa; later that day the agency upgraded the storm further to a severe cyclonic storm.[2] During the strengthening phase, an eye feature formed in the center of the convection, indicative of strengthening.[5] Considering the storm a \"midget tropical cyclone\", the JTWC upgraded Hikaa to the equivalent of hurricane status late on September\u00a023, while the storm was approaching eastern Oman.[6] The IMD followed suit, upgrading Hikaa to a very severe cyclonic storm on September\u00a024, estimating peak winds of 140\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph).[2] Around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1\u00a0minute winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph), based in part on the 26\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) eye in the center of the convection.[6] As Hikaa was nearing land, the eye deteriorated, and the JTWC assessed that the storm weakened.[7] The IMD meanwhile assessed that the cyclone maintained its peak intensity. Around 14:00\u00a0UTC on September\u00a024, Hikaa made landfall in eastern Oman just north of Duqm, becoming the first very severe cyclonic storm on record to strike the country in September. Before Hikaa, only two depressions had struck Oman in the month of September, in 1929 and 1979.[2] The storm quickly weakened over land, as dry air and land interaction diminished the convection.[8] Early on September\u00a025, the IMD downgraded Hikaa to a deep depression, and later to a low-pressure area, by which time the storm was near the border of Oman and Saudi Arabia.[2]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "While Hikaa was first forming, the IMD warned fishermen of the potential of high waves.[2] Officials in Oman advised residents to prepare for the storm and to avoid low-lying areas.[9] In advance of the storm, all schools were closed in Al Wusta and South Sharqiyah governorates.[10] Ferry service to the offshore Masirah Island was canceled. About 750\u00a0people evacuated to nine shelters in Al Wusta Governorate, where Hikaa moved ashore.[11] In Duqm near where Hikaa struck Oman, the airport recorded sustained winds of 96\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph), with gusts to 124\u00a0km/h (77\u00a0mph).[10] Hikaa dropped heavy rainfall as it struck eastern Oman, reaching 80\u00a0mm (3.1\u00a0in) in some locations.[2] The storm also produced 3 to 4\u00a0m (9.8 to 13.1\u00a0ft) waves.[11] A deep-sea fishing boat with a crew of 11 capsized off of Masirah Island during the storm; there were five confirmed fatalities from the shipwreck, and one person was rescued.[12][13] On the Omani mainland, Hikaa flooded roads and wadis \u2013 typically dry riverbeds. In Haima, six people required rescue when they were trapped on a bus in floodwaters.[11] Aon estimated the damage total in the \"millions\", based on hundreds of properties reporting damage.[14]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Typhoon Utor": "Typhoon Utor, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Labuyo,  was a powerful, deadly and destructive tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines and southern China. Utor, contributed by United States for squall line, the 15th depression, the 2nd typhoon and the first super typhoon in the 2013 Pacific typhoon season. Utor started originating near Yap, tracking westwards in a favorable development, allowing the system to be better organized. All agencies have upgraded the system as a depression, with JTWC designated as Tropical Depression 11W and PAGASA naming the depression as Labuyo. Continuing westwards, JMA named 11W as Utor as it continues to consolidate. Developing into a tropical storm on August 9, Utor soon underwent explosive intensification and became a Category 4 super typhoon within a half day. After making landfall over Casiguran, Aurora in Luzon late on August 11. Utor lost its pin-hole eye after having its land interaction. The typhoon re-emerged in the South China Sea, and it ultimately made its second landfall over Yangxi County in China on August 14. Utor downgraded into a depression on the next day as it moved slowly over Guangxi. The remnant low later dissipated on August 18.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Early on August 8, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reported that a tropical disturbance had developed north of Yap.[1] During that day, the system moved westwards and consolidated within a favourable environment of weak vertical wind shear and strong outflow, which was enhanced by a TUTT Cell located to the northwest of the disturbance.[2][3] As a result, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression 11W north of Palau, with the latter naming it Labuyo as it approached the Philippine Area of Responsibility.[4][5][6] During the next day, JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter naming it as Utor (1311).[4][7] Shortly thereafter, Utor began undergoing explosive intensification, achieving typhoon status early on August\u00a010, as an eye developed.[8] On August 11, under the influence of low vertical wind shear, very favourable poleward and westward outflow, and warm sea surface temperature, Utor began to intensify more and formed a clear eye.[9] At 12:00 UTC, Typhoon Utor attained peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 105 knots (195\u00a0km/h, 120\u00a0mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 925\u00a0hPa (27.3\u00a0inHg). The system became exceptionally symmetrical, as the convective bands had further deepened and wrapped tighter around a 13 nautical miles (24\u00a0km; 15\u00a0mi) pin-hole eye, prompting JTWC upgrading Utor to a super typhoon.[10] Due to land interaction with Luzon, the pin-hole eye filled in quickly; as a result, JTWC downgraded Utor to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC.[11] Tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north, Utor made landfall over northern Luzon around 19:00 UTC (03:00 PHT on August 12).[12] Owing to peaks of western Luzon, Utor significantly weakened as the deep convection became disorganised. Early on August 12, Utor arrived at the South China Sea, where the environment southwest of an anticyclone was favourable with diffluence aloft, light vertical wind shear and excellent radial outflow.[13] Although a ragged eye had formed later that day, the typhoon did not restrengthen further when tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge.[14] On August 13, the eye of Utor had become well-defined on the visible satellite imagery, but the intensity and structure remained when the system was tracking northwestward.[15] At 07:50 UTC (15:50 CST) on August 14, Utor made landfall over Yangxi County in Yangjiang, Guangdong, China as a minimal typhoon.[16] At 12:00 UTC, JMA downgraded Utor to a severe tropical storm, shortly before JTWC issued a final warning to the rapidly weakening system due to land interaction.[17] Later, Utor weakened into a tropical storm overland, and JMA downgraded the system into a tropical depression at noon on August 15. However, the remnants began tracking very slowly in Guangxi, until the tropical depression finally dissipated on August 18.[4]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "",
      "Philippines[edit]": "Ahead of Utor affecting the Philippines, PAGASA issued various tropical cyclone signals for Luzon and Visayas, including signal 3 for the provinces of Aurora and Isabela and signal 1 for Metro Manila.\n[18]  As Utor approached Central Luzon, a Malacanang Palace spokesperson called that local government to prepare and evacuate residents living near slopes, mountains and sea.[19] Thirty-two provinces in Luzon and Manila had been placed under signal warnings.[20] In Isabela, 67 families were evacuated before landfall. Under the anticipation of a direct hit, the local Pangasinan government placed the entire province on red alert. On August 11, the governor announced the suspension of classes from pre-school to tertiary level. Government and private offices were also suspended. Rescue equipment and rubber boats had also been placed in the disaster risk area of the province.[21] In the said regions, the government advised all to not engage in water sports or rough seas due to the anticipated rough seas.[22] Utor made its landfall in Casiguran, Aurora at 3 AM (local time) on August 12. Power lines and telecommunications went down and many houses were destroyed.[23] In Nueva Vizcaya, heavy rainfall had been recorded. Some residents in the said province were forced to evacuate due to flooding. Moreover, the Magat River in the province reached the critical level, resulting in the partial opening of four gates in a dam. Electricity was also out in the province. One man died in Baguio after he had been buried alive after a mudslide hit his home. In Isabela, more than 100 families had been affected by Utor. About 200 million pesos in agriculture was blamed on Utor in Isabela alone. Around 1,000 residents in the central Bicol region spent the night in shelters, and 23 fishermen who were out at sea failed to return home in four towns in Catanduanes province.[24] Some cars in North Luzon Expressway used hazard signals as roads were nearly impossible to see. Intense rainfall throughout the day had been recorded in Zambales, which created flash flooding in low-lying areas. The major river in the province then overflowed, flooding homes. The flooding was expected to rise as high tide was expected in the morning.[25] At least 700 passengers were stranded in the ports of Albay, Catanduanes, Sorsogon and Samar. Additionally, 10 flights had also been canceled as Utor brought intense rainfall in many parts of Luzon.[26] Throughout the Philippines, 11 people were killed while four others were listed as missing. A total of 407,493\u00a0people were affected by the typhoon, roughly a third of whom were displaced from their homes. Significant infrastructural damage took place with 2,592\u00a0homes destroyed and 21,197\u00a0more damaged. Losses from Utor amounted to \u20b11.58 billion (US$36.4 million), the majority resulting from agricultural damage.[27]",
      "China[edit]": "The  Chinese bulk carrier Trans Summer sank some 45 nautical miles (83\u00a0km; 52\u00a0mi) southwest of Hong Kong after having been caught in the typhoon. Twenty-one members of the crew were saved.[28] Widespread damage took place in Guangdong Province where at least four people were killed and four others were listed missing. An estimated 1.09\u00a0million people were affected, 161,500 of whom were temporarily relocated due to the threat of flooding. Typhoon-force winds caused a belt factory in Dongguan to collapse, killing 1\u00a0person and injuring 17\u00a0others.[29] Losses across the province amounted to \u00a58.63\u00a0billion (US$1.41\u00a0billion).[30] 18 people were killed in Guangxi Province while more than 1.3\u00a0million people were affected. Losses in the province reached \u00a5698\u00a0million (US$114\u00a0million).[31] Prolonged heavy rains in Hunan Province triggered widespread flooding that caused substantial damage. At least five people were killed and five others were listed missing while 964,600 people were affected by the storm.[32] Following the storm, prices of vegetables were raised by an average of one\u00a0percent in Guangzhou, while the price of leafy vegetables was raised by as much as 15\u00a0percent.[29] A total of 86 people were killed in Mainland China, while total damages were amounted to be \u00a521.5\u00a0billion (US$3.51\u00a0billion).[33]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "During their 2014 annual session, the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee announced that the name Utor would be retired from the naming lists. The name Barijat was chosen to replace Utor, and was used for the first time in the 2018 season. PAGASA announced that the name Labuyo, would be retired from its naming lists after it had caused over PHP1\u00a0billion in damages.[34][35] PAGASA chose the name Lannie to replace Labuyo for the 2017 season.",

It was the fifth longest-lasting intense Atlantic hurricane, as measured by accumulated cyclone energy, since reliable records began in 1966.[1] Sam was the eighteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and fourth major hurricane[nb 1] of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Sam originated from a tropical wave that departed from the western coast of Africa on September 19. The system developed into a tropical depression on September 22, as upper-level winds gradually became more favorable. Intensification was initially slow, with the depression strengthening into Tropical Storm Sam a day later. Soon afterward, the structure of the cyclone quickly improved and rapid intensification began. Sam strengthened into a hurricane on September 24, and reached Category 4 status late on September 25. Sam peaked on September 26 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (249\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 927\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg). The storm turned towards the northwest early on September 27, as it began to weaken due to an eyewall replacement cycle. The hurricane weakened to Category 3 intensity later that day, as its structure decayed. Sam regained Category 4 status early on September 28. Another eyewall replacement cycle on September 29 disrupted the storm once more. A tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda on September 30, due to the potential for tropical storm conditions. The watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning later that day. Sam began to strengthen again on September 30, as the eyewall replacement cycle concluded. Sam reached a secondary peak on October 1, with winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a pressure of 934\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg). Around that time, the storm began a northward track. The hurricane began to weaken on October 2, as a result of increasing vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. Sam finally dropped below major hurricane status on October 3, after nearly eight days. It had remained a major hurricane longer than any Atlantic system since Hurricane Ivan in 2004.[1] The storm moved east-northeastward to northeastward, and then northward, with increasing forward speed while gradually losing strength, weakening to Category 1 status the following day. Sam completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone on October 5, after which its remnants meandered over the northern Atlantic, near Iceland and Greenland, before being absorbed by another extratropical system on October 7.",

      "Origins, development, and peak intensity[edit]": "Hurricane Sam originated from a westward tracking tropical wave that departed from the western coast of Africa on September 19.[3] The National Hurricane Center (NHC) had first forecast the possibility of tropical development earlier that day.[4] Although thunderstorm activity was somewhat organized, the system lacked a closed surface circulation. Upper-level winds hindered the development of the system over the next day,[5][6] causing fluctuations in organization.[7][8] Thunderstorms became increasingly organized,[9] and an elongated low-level surface circulation developed on September 22. This led to the formation of a tropical depression around 21:00 UTC that day. At that time, a mid-level ridge located to the north and west was steering the system westward. The nascent depression was located in a favorable environment both below and aloft, with sea surface temperatures of 82\u201384\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C) and low vertical wind shear.[10] Intensification was initially slow; the cyclone's center was still attached to the northern edge of a low-pressure trough and the former's surface circulation was only narrowly closed.[11] Although the depression had curved rainbands across its northern and western sides, dry air was entraining across its eastern flank.[12] The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Sam at 15:00 UTC on September 23, after its structure improved significantly on both satellite and microwave imagery; the latter showed a banding feature wrapping around 75 percent of the center. The combination of a favorable environment, Sam's structural improvement, and the alignment of the cyclone's low- and mid-level centers signaled that rapid intensification was imminent.[13] The storm rapidly intensified shortly after, with an eyewall forming on microwave imagery,[14] as well as, banding features that wrapped around most of its center. Sam became a Category 1 hurricane around 09:00 UTC on September 24.[15] Sam's strengthening then halted for a brief period as dry air degraded the western portion of its core.[16] The cyclone began to intensify again late on September 24 as the dry air's influence lessened, however, microwave imagery displayed concentric eyewalls, indicating that Sam was undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. The storm continued to track west-northwest, however, its forward speed began to decrease as a result of the mid-level ridge moving to the northwest of Sam.[17] A small, 12-mi (19-km) wide eye emerged on infrared satellite imagery early on September 25, surrounded by a symmetric ring of cold, \u221294\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221270\u00a0\u00b0C) cloud tops.[18][19] Sam was upgraded to a Category 3 major hurricane at 15:00 UTC on September 25, after its eye became mostly cloud-free.[20] The cyclone further strengthened to Category 4 status by 21:00 UTC.[21] A NOAA Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft surveying the storm later that day indicated that multiple mesovortices, including some tornadic-scale ones, were present in both the southeastern and northwestern portions of the eyewall; the wind directions were entirely opposite to the normal wind direction in some regions. Radar from the aircraft displayed that dry air was entraining into the storm, thinning the eyewall in numerous locations.[22] The hurricane continued to intensify through September 26, with the NHC estimating that Sam's peak probably occurred between 19:00 and 22:00\u00a0UTC, likely attaining maximum sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 927\u00a0mbar (27.4\u00a0inHg). During that time, the eye had shrunk to a diameter of 8 miles (13\u00a0km),[23] and the cold convection surrounding the eye had grown in size. Likewise, a microwave pass showed a compact, strong eyewall surrounding the small eye. Sam became only the second Category 4 or 5 hurricane on record so far east or south in the Atlantic so late in the year; the first being Lorenzo in 2019.[24]  Despite Sam's intensity, it remained a small storm, with tropical storm-force winds reaching out 80 miles (130\u00a0km) from its center.[25]",
      "Eyewall replacement cycles, threat to Bermuda, and secondary peak[edit]": "A subtropical ridge located to the north and northeast of Sam caused it to begin tracking northwestward early on September 27. At the same time, a second eyewall replacement cycle was causing the cyclone to weaken. The storm's eye had doubled in size and was cloud-filled while convection in the eyewall was irregular and had degraded across Sam's eastern side.[23] Soon after, Sam's eye disappeared entirely from infrared and visible satellite imagery as a result of the replacement cycle and mid-level dry air intrusions from the west.[26][27] The cyclone weakened to Category 3 status around 15:00 UTC,[27] and bottomed out at 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) around 21:00 UTC. By that time, a new eye had emerged on satellite imagery, surrounded by a ring of \u221285\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221265\u00a0\u00b0C) cloud tops.[28] A reconnaissance aircraft found that the cyclone's wind field had increased following the eyewall replacement cycle,[29] with the radius of hurricane-force winds expanding to 40 miles (64\u00a0km) and the radius of tropical-storm-force winds increasing to 125 miles (201\u00a0km).[30][31] Sam restrengthened into a Category 4 hurricane around 09:00 UTC on September 28, after a ring of colder clouds formed around its eye. The concentric eyewalls that were priorly apparent had fused together in a single eyewall.[29][32] Later that day, the storm's structure degraded, with its eye becoming less pronounced in satellite imagery. Upper-level outflow was reduced in Sam's southwestern region as a result of impinging mid-level dry air, and multiple arcus clouds were radiating outward from the western side of the storm.[33] Sam strengthened to 140\u00a0mph (230\u00a0km/h) early on September 29, while its eye warmed and convection in its eyewall cooled.[34] Shortly after, the cyclone experienced slight weakening as a result of moderate southwesterly wind shear, with Sam's eye becoming cloud-filled and the circulation slanting along the southwest-to-northeast. However, the convection surrounding the eye had cooled.[35] Later that day, Sam's overall cloud pattern had improved, however, a Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft reported that another eyewall replacement cycle was underway.[36][37] The Bermuda Weather Service issued a tropical storm watch for Bermuda at 09:00 UTC on September 30 due to the potential for the cyclone to bring tropical storm conditions to the island.[38] The watch was increased to a tropical storm warning at 21:00 UTC.[39] Early on September 30, Sam began another strengthening trend as the eyewall replacement cycle concluded, located over a warm ocean eddy and within a region of low wind shear.[40] The cyclone exhibited a warm 50\u201368\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C), 29-mi (46-km) wide eye surrounded by cold, \u221276 to \u221294\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221260 to \u221270\u00a0\u00b0C) cloud tops from September 30\u2013October 1.[41][42] Early on October 1, Sam turned towards the north-northwest as it began to round the western edge of the subtropical ridge.[42] Sam reached its secondary peak around 09:00 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 934\u00a0mbar (27.6\u00a0inHg).[43]",
      "Weakening and demise[edit]": "The cyclone maintained its intensity for about 12 hours as it tracked northward.[44][45] The storm maintained a symmetric, well-defined eye, and multiple mesovorticies were apparent in satellite images.[45] Sam began to weaken on October 2, with its eye becoming cloud-filled.[46] During the next several hours, the cyclone turned towards the northeast under the influence of a steering flow between a sizeable low-pressure system located over Atlantic Canada and a deep-layer ridge located to the east and northeast of Sam.[46][47] Moderate southerly deep-layer shear continued to weaken the system,[48] with Sam falling to Category 3 intensity by 21:00 UTC.[49] The hurricane's eye disappeared from satellite imagery and its cloud tops warmed to \u221276 to \u221285\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221260 to \u221265\u00a0\u00b0C) on October 3.[50][51] Sam bottomed out as a low-end Category 2 hurricane later that day.[52] The cyclone began another eyewall replacement late on October 3, as it crossed into sub-79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C) sea surface temperatures. Sam's wind field continued to grow, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 230 mi (370 km) out from the center on all four sides.[53] Sam strengthened slightly as it moved across a warm eddy early on October 4. The storm's inner eyewall became more intense and its eye cleared.[54] The cyclone moved across colder sea surface temperatures shortly after and resumed weakening. The inner eyewall quickly decayed on the northwestern side.[55] Sam weakened to a Category 1 hurricane around 21:00 UTC as its cloud tops warmed and its eye vanished from satellite imagery.[56][57] Sam began to transition to extratropical cyclone shortly after, with its cloud pattern broadening on the northwestern side and convection decreasing.[58] At 09:00\u00a0UTC on October 5, Sam became fully extratropical as it traversed 57\u00a0\u00b0F (14\u00a0\u00b0C) waters, and the NHC issued its final advisory on the storm. Sam's low-level circulation center was exposed on the southern edge of a \u221258\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221250\u00a0\u00b0C) cloud band. The cyclone had developed the appearance of an occluded extratropical system. Although its core remained warm in the middle and upper levels, the lower level consisted of cold stratocumulus clouds.[59] For the next few days, Sam executed a short counterclockwise loop, before continuing its northeastward motion, while gradually weakening.[60][61][62] Early on October 7, the post-tropical cyclone merged with another extratropical low over the north Atlantic. Afterward, this new low made a large counterclockwise loop between Iceland and Greenland, before being absorbed by a stronger low on October 9, to the southwest of Iceland.[62][63] This low then accelerated eastward while rapidly weakening, passing just south of Iceland, before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone over Scandinavia on October 12.[64][65][66]",
      "Impact and records[edit]": "While passing northeast of Puerto Rico, light winds associated with Sam's circulation interacted with the typically moist environment and, in conjunction with the normal diurnal cycle, produced locally heavy rainfall on the island on September\u00a028\u201329. Some street flooding occurred along roads with poor drainage and several mudslides were reported in western communities.[67][68][69] Large swells produced by the hurricane affected portions of the Lesser Antilles through late-September.[70] Although Sam remained more than 900\u00a0mi (1,400\u00a0km) from the mainland United States, its circulation produced dangerous swells across the Eastern seaboard.[71] Thirty people required rescue from rip currents in New Hanover County, North Carolina. However, there were no injuries or fatalities.[72] In Bermuda, tropical storm warnings and watches were raised on September\u00a030 and remained in effect until October\u00a02. Although the core of Sam remained east of the territory,[73] its broadening wind field brought tropical storm-force winds to the area.[74] Sustained winds of 25\u201344\u00a0mph (40\u201371\u00a0km/h) were measured, with the strongest occurring at higher elevations. A peak gust of 53\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) was measured at the National Museum of Bermuda. Rainfall during the storm's passage was negligible.[73] Sam remained a major hurricane for 7.75 days, which was longer than any other Atlantic system this season, and the longest since Hurricane Ivan in 2004.[1][73] Sam's total ACE of 53.8 was the highest for any Atlantic named storm in 2021,[75] and 5th highest overall since 1966.[1]",

      "Cyclone Alan": " Tropical Cyclone Alan was considered to be one of the worst natural disasters experienced in French Polynesia. The system, first noted as a tropical disturbance on April\u00a017, 1998 east of the Northern Cook Islands, initially moved erratically prior to its designation as Alan upon developing into a tropical cyclone on April\u00a021. The following day, Alan reached its estimated peak intensity with 10-minute\u00a0maximum sustained wind speeds of 75\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph), posing several forecasting challenges due to difficulties in establishing its location and intensity. On April\u00a023, Alan appeared to become sheared with the low-level circulation center displaced about 20\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) from the nearest atmospheric convection. However, over the next day, after the mid-level trough of low pressure shearing the system moved faster than expected, Alan became better organized. While situated about 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) west-northwest of the French Polynesian island of Tahiti, the system drifted south-southeastward. Early on April\u00a025, Alan passed near to or over the French Polynesian Society Islands of Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. However, strong wind shear pulled the system apart, with visible imagery confirming the system's degeneration into a depression with a fully exposed low-level circulation. The system affected French Polynesia with high winds and torrential rain, causing several landslides on the Society Islands. The landslides resulted in the collapse of two bridges, and also overturned trees, in turn obstructing roads. Overall, ten people died as a result of the system, while thirty others were injured, with a majority of the casualties a result of landslides. On the islands of Raiatea, Taha'a and Huahine, several churches, schools and clinics were damaged, while water and electricity supplies were cut off. On the islands, around 750\u00a0houses were destroyed, with 430\u00a0and 150\u00a0wrecked on Huahine and Ra'i\u0101tea, respectively.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On April\u00a017, 1998, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor the development of a tropical disturbance east of the Northern Cook Islands.[1][2] Before the FMS initiated advisories on the system on April\u00a019, the system moved erratically; it later developed into a weak depression while it located about 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) north of Manihiki Atoll in the Northern Cook Islands.[2] Over the next couple of days, the system slowly moved northwards, gradually organizing, with gale-force winds developing in its southern quadrant on April\u00a020.[2][3] Over the next day, the system developed into a category\u00a01 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, before the FMS named the system Alan at 1800\u00a0UTC.[1] By this time, the cyclone, located about 300\u00a0km (185\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Manihiki, started to move westwards.[4] On April\u00a022, the FMS estimated that Alan had reached its peak intensity with 10-minute\u00a0maximum sustained wind speeds of 40\u00a0kn (75\u00a0km/h; 45\u00a0mph), just as the system started to pose several forecasting challenges due to difficulties in establishing its location and intensity.[4][5] Later that day the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center (NPMOC) started to issue warnings on Alan and accidentally assigned it the designation 32P as opposed to 36P, estimating peak 1-minute\u00a0sustained wind speeds of 85\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph).[3][6] On April\u00a023, the system appeared to become sheared, with the low-level circulation center displaced about 20\u00a0km (10\u00a0mi) from the nearest atmospheric convection.[4][7] As a result, the FMS reported Alan's weakening into a depression, while the NPMOC subsequently issued their final advisory on the system.[1][2][7] Over the next day, as a mid-level trough of low pressure shearing Alan moved faster than expected, the depression became better organized and developed favorable upper-level outflow.[2][8] As a result, the NPMOC initiated advisories on the system again on April\u00a024, and later that day, the FMS reported that Alan re-intensified into a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone.[8][5] While located about 555\u00a0km (345\u00a0mi) west-northwest of the French Polynesian island of Tahiti, the system moved south-southeastward under the influence of an upper-level anticyclone located to its east.[2][8] Early on April\u00a025, Alan passed near to or over the French Polynesian Society Islands of Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Ra'i\u0101tea.[2] As the system moved near Bora Bora, a maximum wind gust of 147\u00a0km/h (91\u00a0mph) and a pressure observation of 1002\u00a0hPa (29.6\u00a0inHg) were recorded,[4] indicating the minimal strength of Alan; however, the wind gust was stronger than that expected of similarly intense tropical cyclones.[4] It was later speculated that squalls within Alan's convective feeder band may have been responsible for the stronger wind gusts.[4] On April\u00a025, strong wind shear pulled the system apart, with visible imagery revealing a fully exposed low-level circulation.[1] As a result, the FMS reported that the system weakened into a depression at 1800\u00a0UTC that day, while located about 185\u00a0km (115\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Tahiti.[1][2] The NPMOC subsequently reissued their final advisory early the next day as the system drifted south-southeastward while located west of Tahiti.[2][9]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "Cyclone Alan produced high winds and torrential rain over French Polynesia between April 24 and 25, causing several landslides on the Society Islands,[2][10][11] resulting in the collapse of two bridges and obstruction of roads by fallen trees.[12] Damage associated with the system was mainly confined to the Leeward Islands of Bora Bora, Tahaa, Ra'i\u0101tea and Huahine, which had all been damaged by Cyclone Osea earlier in the season.[2][4] Overall, ten people died as a result of the system, while thirty others were injured, with the majority of the casualties occurring due to landslides.[4][13] On Bora Bora, wind gusts of up to 147\u00a0km/h (91\u00a0mph) were reported, while on Tahaa, wind gusts of up to 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) were reported.[1][4] On the islands of Ra'i\u0101tea, Tahaa and Huahine, several churches, schools and clinics were damaged, while water and electricity supplies were cut off.[4][12] On the islands, around 750\u00a0houses were destroyed, with 430\u00a0and 150\u00a0wrecked on Huahine and Ra'i\u0101tea, respectively.[12] On Huahine, the extent of the damage, along with a sharp dip on the Uturoa barograph trace, suggested that a tornado may have been spawned in one of Alan's convective bands.[4] In the system's aftermath a, 60-person relief team was deployed from Tahiti to the affected islands to assist with emergency operations.[10] The French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin both sent messages of support to the Leeward Islands, and in French Polynesia, the system was considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in the islands' history.[4][14] A few days after Cyclone Alan impacted the islands, Cyclone Bart caused an additional ten deaths and some minor damage to the French territory.[1][4][15] During December 1998, the European Community Humanitarian Office responded to a government appeal, providing \u20ac105,000\u00a0for tents, medical aid, food and clothing.[16]",

      "August 2020 Midwest derecho": " The August 2020 Midwest derecho was a powerful derecho affecting the Midwestern United States on August 10\u201311, 2020, primarily eastern Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana. It caused high winds and spawned an outbreak of weak tornadoes. Some areas reported torrential rain and large hail.[2][7][1] Damage was moderate to severe across much of the affected area, as sustained wind speeds of 70 miles per hour (110 kilometers per hour; 31 meters per second) were prevalent. The greatest damage occurred in eastern Iowa, and northern Illinois, where multiple tornadoes touched down. The highest winds occurred in Iowa, measured at 126\u00a0mph (203\u00a0km/h; 56.3\u00a0m/s)[II] and highest estimated from post-event damage surveys at 140\u00a0mph (225\u00a0km/h; 62.6\u00a0m/s).[III][2][7] Millions across the Midwest were affected by wide-scale utility disruptions,[12] residential and commercial property damage, and severe damage to corn and soybean crops.[1][7][2] Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was the most severely damaged,[11][13] suffering a near-complete blackout that lasted for weeks in some areas,[10][14] widespread and severe property damage,[15] and an estimated loss of at least half of the city's tree canopy.[16][17] The derecho caused over $11 billion (2020 USD) in damages[4] and spawned a years-long cleanup effort.[18]",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Derechos of similar intensity to the August\u00a02020 storm impact the Midwestern U.S. roughly once per decade, with similar derechos having occurred in 1998 and 2011.[2] As with derechos in general, the continuous downwelling of high winds associated with the nearby jet stream and the expansion of dense rain-cooled air in the storm's wake induced the destructive winds and the storm's motion.[19] However, the August\u00a02020 derecho was unusual for the longevity of the damaging winds it produced; some areas were subjected to these winds for up to an hour compared to the 10\u201320\u00a0minutes of sustained damaging winds in a typical derecho, resulting in conditions similar to the passage of a hurricane's eyewall.[2][3] Media outlets described the storm as an \"inland hurricane\".[12][20][21][22][23] On average, the storm front traveled west-to-east at an average speed of 55\u00a0mph (88.5\u00a0km/h; 24.6\u00a0m/s).[8] A combination of strong ambient winds and extreme convective instability facilitated the strength and unusual characteristics of the derecho. The latter factor resulted from the conducive overlapping of moist air drawn northward across the Mississippi Valley and warm and dry air aloft originating from the Southwestern U.S., resulting in an elevated mixed layer that allowed instability to escalate.[19] These convectively unstable conditions permeated across Iowa and were characterized by steep lapse rates in the mid-levels of the troposphere as sampled via weather balloon launches from Omaha, Nebraska, on the morning of August\u00a010, and from Davenport, Iowa, at noon that day;[24][25] the atmospheric sounding retrieved from the Davenport balloon launch observed lapse rates of 8.5\u00b0C/km.[25] The warm front demarcating the northward push of the unstable air also focused the development of storms across the region.[19] Prior to August\u00a010, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) and the local offices of the National Weather Service (NWS) did not anticipate a storm of exceptional magnitude.[19] Predictive weather models also yielded inaccurate projections of the storm and continued to do so even on the day of the event.[26] On August\u00a03, the SPC noted in a Convective Outlook that a series of shortwave troughs was forecast to move through northern portions of the U.S. in the coming days, becoming possible impetuses for thunderstorm development leading up to and on August\u00a010.[27][IV] Three days before the event, the SPC assessed a Marginal Risk of severe weather for a swath of the central U.S. extending from northern Kansas to southern Michigan, including parts of southern Iowa, northern Missouri, and northern Illinois.[29] The risk level was escalated to a Slight Risk  at midnight on August\u00a010 prior to the onset of the damaging storms.[19] Temperatures and dew points were between 70\u201380\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C) across the Midwestern U.S. around dawn on the morning of August\u00a010. Winds blowing from the west were juxtaposed atop near-surface winds blowing from the southwest and south, resulting in strong wind shear over the region. The derecho began as a cluster of scattered thunderstorms that had formed during the previous night over south-central South Dakota. These storms tracked east along the South Dakota\u2013Nebraska border and became better organized and coalesced, producing hail with diameters between 1\u20132\u00a0in (25\u201351\u00a0mm) and wind gusts between 60\u201370\u00a0mph (97\u2013113\u00a0km/h) over a narrow swath. In response to these developments, the SPC issued a special Convective Outlook at 8:00\u00a0a.m., highlighting a now Enhanced Risk  of severe weather for areas in the storms' path including Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Quad Cities metropolitan area, and Peoria, Illinois.[30] According to the SPC, there was a 30\u00a0percent likelihood of areas within the Enhanced Risk zone experiencing thunderstorm winds or wind gusts in excess of 50\u00a0kt (60\u00a0mph; 95\u00a0km/h).[31] After 8:00\u00a0a.m., the storm moved through Sioux City, Iowa, crossing the Big Sioux River and entering western Iowa. Heating associated with the daytime hours made for warmer conditions near the ground, allowing strong winds produced by the storms to descend to and reach the surface. The storm's winds began to increase considerably after the storm reached west central Iowa at around 10:\u00a0a.m. During this time, some of the derecho's winds spread outward from the storm beneath an atmospheric inversion aloft, spreading to the south and southeast and causing damage over 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) away from the storm in areas with minimal rainfall. Over the next two hours, the storm traversed central Iowa with a rapid forward speed of up to 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h), impacting communities including Ames, Des Moines, and Marshalltown.[30][32] Wind gusts approaching 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) were produced by the storm during this period.[30] Aloft, the storm was being supported by a rear-inflow jet sporting winds of 80\u2013100\u00a0kt (90\u2013115\u00a0mph; 150\u2013185\u00a0km/h) with the downwind airmass exhibiting convective available potential energy (CAPE) values between 2000\u20132500\u00a0J/kg.[33] At 11:25\u00a0a.m., a severe thunderstorm watch tagged as denoting a particularly dangerous situation was issued by the SPC for areas ahead of the storm including central Iowa, southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and northwestern Indiana.[34] Shortly after, the SPC introduced a Moderate Risk for severe weather in its categorical outlooks for similar areas.[30] Around the same time, a counterclockwise vortex developed on the northern end of the storm, resulting in the storm attaining a bow-like structure with its strongest winds at the apex of this shape.[19] University of Oklahoma meteorologist and tornado expert Stephen Corfidi remarked that the vortex was \"one of the most distinctive ones of that size\" he had ever seen.[3] The core of stronger winds tracked east at speeds of 65\u201370\u00a0mph (110\u2013130\u00a0km/h) and bore faster wind speeds.[35] The derecho was at its strongest when it moved across the Cedar Rapids area of eastern Iowa. Based on the severity of damage observed, the NWS estimated that wind gusts of 130\u2013140\u00a0mph (210\u2013230\u00a0km/h) impacted parts of Benton and Linn counties in Iowa, including downtown Cedar Rapids and Marion. These winds diminished slightly as the derecho approached the Mississippi River, though gusts of 80\u2013100\u00a0mph (130\u2013160\u00a0km/h) remained widespread. The more extreme corridor of wind gusts transitioned into a broader swath of 60\u201370\u00a0mph (97\u2013113\u00a0km/h) winds as the storm moved across northern Illinois and northwestern Indiana between 2\u20135\u00a0p.m. Despite the weakening of straight-line winds, the atmospheric environment became more conducive for tornadogenesis during this time. This resulted in several brief EF0 and EF1 tornadoes developing over northern Illinois and Indiana. The derecho's winds continued to lessen as the storm tracked farther east, weakening below damaging levels shortly after 7\u00a0p.m. as the storm was moving into Ohio and Michigan.[30][7]",
      "Impact and damage[edit]": "",
      "Overview[edit]": "In its October\u00a02020 review, NOAA updated its database of billion-dollar disasters to include this event (along with other disasters from the summer season) with preliminary estimated damages averaging 7.5\u00a0billion dollars,[V][36] before upgrading the estimate to $11 billion.[VI][4][3] As of October\u00a02020,[update] it is the most costly thunderstorm in US history.[3] The financial toll of this storm was the second-highest for an individual 2020 U.S. natural disaster,[VII] surpassed only by Hurricane Laura's preliminary damage figure of $14.1\u00a0billion.[5][37]",
      "Utilities and telecommunications disruption[edit]": "Utility disruption and infrastructure damage occurred in much of the storm's path.[38][39] Early estimates showed more than a million customers without power.[40][41] Between August\u00a010 and 13, 1.9\u00a0million customers were affected by 1.4\u00a0million maximum simultaneous outages\u2014759,000 in Illinois, 585,000 in Iowa, 283,000 in Indiana, and 345,000 in other states, including Missouri, Wisconsin, and Michigan.[6][42] Three days after the derecho, over 100,000 customers in Illinois, and 200,000 in Iowa, remained without power.[38] The damage in some affected areas was so extensive that Mid-American Energy sent linemen to neighboring utility Alliant Energy to assist.[43] The Duane Arnold Energy Center cooling towers were damaged and the nuclear reactor was shut down permanently.[44] By August 23, Alliant announced that power had been restored to 99 percent of their affected customers.[45] Mediacom, a telecommunications company, reported 340,000 customers lost Internet access in the affected states.[46][47]",
      "Property damage[edit]": "Almost every structure within the 75 square miles (190\u00a0km2) Cedar Rapids city limits, including residences, 20 schools, and businesses, were damaged in some way, much of it severe, some of it catastrophic.[13][10][83][78] Hundreds of thousands of trees, for which Cedar Rapids was known, were severely damaged or felled by the storm with both Cedar Rapids and nearby Marion estimated to have lost half or more of their tree canopy from the storm;[16] professional arborists and state foresters urged residents to seek professional help for their tree damage, saying it could take months to clean up.[78][89] Many local businesses were forced to close, some indefinitely due to damage.[9][10] Most of the city's roads became impassible due to storm debris.[15][9][10] Without electrical refrigeration, food spoiled en masse while trash and recycling pickup had been halted until August 31 due to impassable streets causing bags of rotting trash to line curbsides, subjecting them to scavengers.[10][78][79]",
      "Agricultural damage[edit]": "Farmers in Iowa, a major agricultural state and top corn producer in the US, found their crops had been flattened and agricultural infrastructure such as silos, grain bins and grain elevators imploded by the storm.[46][52] The crop damage was visible in satellite imagery, which the USDA called impressive.[52][8][53] NASA researchers assisted in satellite image analysis of derecho crop damage.[54] The USDA's Risk Management Agency reported that 57 of Iowa's 99 counties, with 14\u00a0million acres (56,700\u00a0km2) of crops, had been in the derecho's path.[VIII][55] This is almost 66 percent of the 21.3\u00a0million acres (86,200\u00a0km2) of corn and soybeans planted in 2020, or 45 percent of the state's total 30.6\u00a0million acres (124,000\u00a0km2) of arable land.[46] Damage was particularly heavy in 36 of those 57 counties, accounting for a total of 3.57\u00a0million acres (14,400\u00a0km2) of corn and 2.5\u00a0million acres (10,100\u00a0km2) of soybeans, which combined account for 20 percent of Iowa's cropland.[3][52][55] Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said, on August 14, that the storm was a \"devastating blow\" to the Iowa agricultural industry, especially since it took place mere weeks before the beginning of the seasonal harvest.[55] On August 19, he said the storm destroyed an estimated 100\u00a0million US bushels (3.52\u00a0million cubic metres) worth of grain storage and processing infrastructure as well.[56] The average projected yield for the state was nearly halved, from 202 US bushels per acre (1,760\u00a0m3/km2) to 100\u2013150 US bushels per acre (871\u20131,310\u00a0m3/km2).[57] Prescient Weather CEO Jan Dutton estimated that 180\u2013270\u00a0million US bushels (6.34\u20139.51\u00a0million cubic metres) had been destroyed or degraded, a small portion of the tens of billions of bushels the US produces annually.[52] Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for StoneX, estimated the damage to Iowa crops to be 200\u2013400\u00a0million US bushels (7.05\u201314.1\u00a0million cubic metres).[58] The agricultural damage of the derecho was compounded by a concurrent drought affecting 31 counties. Farmers preferred drought to wet conditions in the wake of the derecho damage, as wet conditions would induce rot and make it harder to harvest the flattened crops.[59][60]",
      "Nebraska[edit]": "In eastern Nebraska near Tekamah and Fremont, some of earliest storm damage occurred. The National Weather Service issued a warning at 8:45\u00a0a.m., with Omaha reporting its first damage just eight minutes later. Winds reached 67\u00a0mph (108\u00a0km/h; 30.0\u00a0m/s), tree damage was significant, downed limbs blocked some roads. At least one person was injured.[61] In Omaha, the state's largest city, over 50,000 were left without power, a couple thousand remained so for two or three days.[48][61][62]",
      "Iowa[edit]": "The Iowa Governor's office estimated on August 16 that the storm severely damaged or destroyed over 8,000 homes and caused $23.6 million in damage to public infrastructure. The cost of cleaning up debris from the storm was estimated at $21.6 million.[63] Several major roads in Iowa City were closed due to storm debris, including Interstate 380 between Iowa City and Cedar Rapids.[64] Four state parks were closed through the end of August for cleanup;[65] as of December\u00a02020,[update] all had reopened except Palisades-Kepler State Park, which was closed indefinitely due to storm damage until reopening on April 23, 2021.[66][67] Emma Hanigan, an urban forester for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, said that the impact on the state's trees will be felt for decades.[3] Affected towns and cities advised residents not to travel due to damage. City-wide and county-wide states of emergency were declared.[68] On August 13, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds issued a state-level disaster proclamation for 23 of Iowa's counties,[38] which expanded to 27 counties on August 14.[69] On August 17, President Trump partially approved Gov. Reynolds' request for a federal disaster declaration.[70] An amended declaration for Individual Assistance was approved by the White House for Linn County, Iowa alone on August 20, then expanded to 10 counties on September 1 along with concurrent natural disaster declarations from the United States Department of Agriculture on September 3.[71][72][73][74] On September 10, Gov. Reynolds extended the disaster proclamation for those aforementioned Iowa counties.[75] On September 11, it was announced FEMA added seven additional Iowa counties (for a total of 23) to the August 17 federal disaster declaration, as well as the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa.[76]",
      "Cedar Rapids area[edit]": "Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Linn County seat and second-largest city in the state, was one of the hardest hit areas of the storm.[15][9][10] Adjutant General Benjamin Corell, Commander of the Iowa National Guard, compared the extent of the damage with what he personally witnessed after Hurricane Katrina.[77] Cedar Rapids city officials described the damage as being worse than the 2008 flood.[15] Local hospitals, running on backup power, saw hundreds of injuries due to the storm.[78] The widespread debris, downed electrical lines, and gas leaks led to a curfew through August 24.[78][79] Cedar Rapids Director of Public Works Jen Winter said in September 2020 that months of cleanup lay ahead for the city.[80] Approximately 65% of the tree canopy was destroyed city wide.[81]",
      "Utility damage and outages[edit]": "After the storm, Linn County peaked at over 95 percent power loss to residents due to infrastructure damage, with Cedar Rapids experiencing a maximum 98 percent power loss.[82] [15][46][83] Thousands of electrical poles and miles of wire were downed; many residential gas connections were also broken.[9] Radio masts and towers were damaged or destroyed, causing radio outages and dysfunctional mobile phone service.[9] On August 12, Mediacom said 57,000 modems were offline across eastern Iowa, most of them in the Cedar Rapids area; two days later, nearly 10,000 of those customers were still without service.[78][84] On August 14, a hundred engineering and support personnel of the Iowa National Guard were activated to assist the region. A week after the storm, 75,000 Iowans, most of them in Linn County, still lacked electricity.[85][86] On August 19, the Linn County Rural Electric Cooperative announced 99 percent power restoration to its customers.[87] By September 22, hundreds of Mediacom and ImOn customers still remained without internet service.[88]",
      "Evaluation and cleanup of damage and debris[edit]": "In a preliminary evaluation four days after the storm, the Cedar Rapids fire department declared over a thousand residences unsafe to occupy; in addition, 300 had non-structural damage and over 200 cosmetic damage. By August 23, that count had shrunk to 140, with many more buildings being added to the non-structural damage category.[90][91] By September 4, 2020 utility workers had installed over 3,400 new poles along with 400\u00a0mi (640\u00a0km; 640,000\u00a0m) of wiring in the Cedar Rapids area after repairing most of the main electrical infrastructure in the city.[80] As of November\u00a017, 2020,[update] Alliant Energy was still working on restoring street lights in the area, many still hampered by debris or broken trees.[92] On November 9, 2020 Dr. Melanie Giesler, a local physician, said increased allergies in the area were likely due to the derecho damage, spurred on by dust, debris, and mold growing on dead plant matter.[93] In July 2022, The Gazette reported that nearly two years after the derecho, owners of homes with historic preservation concerns were still repairing antique windows damaged by the storm. Local groups and trusts were reported to have organized workshops for affected homeowners about how to properly restore this type of construction.[94] On August 21, Marion city officials announced 98 percent of its streets were cleared and over 7,000 truckloads of debris had been removed.[95] A month after the storm, Cedar Rapids had completed the first pass of storm debris collection on only 37.5 percent of its streets.[79] By September 28, the city had removed 53,598 truckloads of debris for an approximate total of 230,000 short tons (210,000\u00a0t).[96] As of November 24, 2020, cleanup was ongoing with the city currently working on the final public collection of non-organic debris. Collection of organic/tree debris is continuing indefinitely with the city having removed 2.8\u00a0million cubic yards (2.1\u00a0million cubic metres) of organic debris to date; the trimming of damaged tree limbs in the public right of way is 73 percent complete.[18] On December 3, Taylor Burgin, Cedar Rapids' construction engineering manager, said that city crews and contractors are beginning a thorough cleanup of city parks \u2014 this is expected to add an estimated 1.5\u00a0million cubic yards (1.1\u00a0million cubic metres) to city removal metrics.[needs update] Burgin also noted the city has removed around 2,000 trees, but needed at least 10,000 more to complete citywide cleanup.[97]",
      "Des Moines metropolitan area[edit]": "In the Des Moines metropolitan area, over 132,000 customer experienced outages, according to MidAmerican.[14][98][99] The city said on August 21 that cleanup was slower than desired, estimating that damage cleanup could take up to six weeks. It planned to lease equipment from contractors to accelerate cleanup.[65] The city of Ankeny estimated it would take four to six weeks to fully clean up debris.[100] A Hy-Vee grocery store there was found by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources to have illegally dumped 800 US gallons (3,000\u00a0L) of spoiled milk into storm sewers, contaminating a local waterway. The company assisted the state in cleanup efforts, blaming misinformed employees.[101] Buccaneer Arena, home ice of the Des Moines Buccaneers minor-league hockey team, sustained significant roof damage.[39][14]",
      "Marshalltown[edit]": "Marshalltown suffered extensive property damage. Over a hundred cars parked near a factory had their windows blown out. Reports described 99 miles per hour (160 kilometers per hour; 44 meters per second) winds, roofs being ripped off, and loose wood debris embedded in the sides of buildings.[39][102][103] One week after the storm, nearly 7,000 residents of the city were still waiting for power restoration; 99 percent restoration was achieved on Aug 23.[45][104] The damage to public parks in the city and surrounding Marshall County was \"extensive\", particularly to trees.[105] Damage metrics released on September 1 showed nearly 2,800 buildings were damaged or destroyed in the storm, more than the 2018 EF3 tornado which hit the city.[106] City cleanup for the derecho is estimated around $4 million, of which FEMA and the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management will assist for reimbursement.[107] By August 20, the city had hauled away 66,000 cubic yards (50,000\u00a0m3) of debris, almost triple the amount of the 2018 tornado.[108] By late October, Justin Nickel, the city's public works director, said debris collection and cleanup were nearly complete for the city.[107] Marshalltown Veteran's Memorial Coliseum, a historic city sports venue, is reopening soon as of November\u00a030, 2020[update] after being severely damaged by the 2018 tornado and later impacted by the derecho.[109] As of December\u00a08, 2020,[update] Riverside Cemetery, a century-old burial site located in the city, remains littered with debris as the city struggles to raise money for its care.[110]",
      "Illinois[edit]": "Across the state of Illinois, high winds and fifteen weak tornadoes, the majority of the derecho's tornadoes (see \u00a7\u00a0Confirmed tornadoes), caused variable damage to buildings, trees, and vehicles.[7] Officials reported a dozen individuals directly injured by the storm across the state.[7] A month after the storm, Chicago was still cleaning up storm damaged areas. In city parks, over 500 trees fell. The city fielded over 12,000 emergency calls regarding trees in the city after the storm hit.[111][needs update] Over 800,000 Com Ed customers lost power.[112]",
      "Confirmed fatalities[edit]": "In Fort Wayne, Indiana, a woman was killed when high winds tipped over her mobile home.[113] In Poweshiek County, Iowa, Emergency Management confirmed the deaths of two: a Malcom woman in her 40s killed when a tree fell on her porch and a Brooklyn man in his 40s, a city employee and electrician, killed by electrocution from a downed power line he was attempting to repair.[51] The Linn County Sheriff's Office confirmed a 63-year-old man died from a falling tree while biking.[114]",
      "Responses and criticism[edit]": "In the week after the storm, Iowa elected officials such as US Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, US Representative Abby Finkenauer, and Governor Kim Reynolds called for and worked to secure a federal disaster declaration from President Donald Trump.[13] The declaration was formally requested by Reynolds on August 16 for nearly $4 billion in federal aid.[63] The following day, Trump announced he had partially approved Reynolds's request, but did not approve the requested FEMA Individual Assistance Program, which Reynolds's office says \"provides disaster-impacted homeowners and businesses with programs and services to maximize recovery, including assistance with housing, personal property replacement, medical expenses and legal services\".[70][63][115] An amended declaration to include Individual Assistance worked its way through Washington, according to Reynolds. The White House approved it for Linn County on August 20.[71][72] On September 1, the governor's Office announced the addition of 10 counties[IX] approved for FEMA Individual Assistance.[73] On September 3, US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue declared natural disasters in eighteen[X], opening up Farm Service Agency and other USDA disaster relief programs.[74] On September 11, it was announced FEMA added seven[XI] Iowa counties to the August 17 federal disaster declaration increasing the total counties to 23[XII], allowing for Public Assistance Program use in those counties; a separate declaration was declared for the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa as well.[76]",
      "Official visits[edit]": "On August 13, Vice President Mike Pence held two campaign rallies in Iowa. He promised to help Iowa rebuild, but did not tour areas damaged by the storm.[77] On August 14, Reynolds arrived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa with more than 100 Iowa National Guard members, activated to help repair the damage.[77] On August 15, Finkenauer toured damage in Marshalltown.[116] On August 17, Pete Gaynor, Administrator of FEMA, traveled to Iowa to meet with Governor Reynolds about the disaster.[117] On August 18, Trump arrived at midday in Cedar Rapids, joining a private meeting with Iowa senators Grassley, Ernst and Cedar Rapids Mayor Brad Hart. At the meeting, Hart begged Trump to approve the Individual Assistance Program. Trump remained at the airport and did not interact with the public, tour damage, or assist in recovery efforts during his visit.[115][118][119] On August 19, Naig met with farmers in Marion to personally assess the damage. Ernst toured damaged in Marshalltown.[56][120] On September 2, Grassley and Ernst fielded questions from Cedar Rapids-area non-profit organizations.[121] On September 3, US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue underwent an Iowa National Guard-hosted aerial tour of crop damage in Iowa along with Reynolds, Ernst, and Naig.[74][122]",
      "Local, non-government, or individual assistance efforts[edit]": "On August 14, the city of Cedar Rapids set up five resource centers to distribute basic necessities to the public.[123] These centers were later shut down on August 31.[79] Many local businesses,[124] private individuals,[115] religious groups,[125][126][127] and non-profit organizations,[128] such as Cedar Valley Black Lives Matter,[10] The Salvation Army and Tyson Foods,[129] and United Way,[130] raised money online or provided relief efforts on their own, distributing food, fuel, toiletries, or assisting in debris removal.[115][131] Mid-American Energy, one of Iowa's two major electric utilities, gave away bagged ice in Cedar Rapids on August 20\u201321.[132] Operation BBQ Relief, a disaster relief agency specializing in barbecue, deployed to Cedar Rapids starting August 16, providing over 45,000 meals to residents as of August 21, earning praise from politicians.[133] Local non-profits told Iowa's senators that assisting the region has been difficult due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reducing their donations and funding.[121] On November 14, a large replanting campaign was announced that would begin in the spring of 2021.[17][needs update]",
      "Criticism[edit]": "",
      "Lack of news coverage[edit]": "Local news media were hard-pressed to provide reporting under disaster conditions, limiting national news coverage of the storm. KCRG-TV anchor Beth Malicki was especially prominent in speaking out on awareness of the situation.[134] On August 13, Cedar Rapids Mayor Hart gave an interview where he rejected requesting National Guard assistance, uncertain of what it could do.[135]",
      "Lack of response and assistance[edit]": "On August 14, Ashton Kutcher, originally from Cedar Rapids, criticized the lack of federal response and aid. He called on Pence and Trump to aid the affected areas.[136][137] The same day, Iowa state officials were questioned about why it took three days to begin aid effort. General Benjamin Corell, commander of the Iowa National Guard, said they first received local requests for help on August 13.[77] Residents of Cedar Rapids had mixed emotions regarding official responses and assistance. For many, they felt ignored for days after the storm and offered too-little, too-late by the non-local support. Some impoverished or less-affluent neighborhood residents said they felt neglected, abandoned, or given lower priority among utility and government assistance.[131][138][139] Many grassroots efforts began hours after the storm subsided, with residents lending support through mutual aid, and trying to take care of the least fortunate, but finding working with government and assistance organizations very disheartening.[10][115] The lack of electricity, telecommunications, and ability to travel led to the delays in assistance according to both official and non-government organizations. These explanations did not reassure storm-battered populations.[121] Tamara Marcus, activist with Cedar Rapids Advocates for Social Justice, a Black Lives Matter organization, said \"We need to ask ourselves, 'Why is it that each time we have a disaster or pandemic, the most-vulnerable are the worst impacted, particularly communities of color?'\u2009\" during a September 2 forum with Ernst and Grassley.[121] Residential damage doubled the homeless population in the Cedar Rapids area as some landlords evicted residents from unsafe apartment complexes.[140][141]",
      "Role of politicians[edit]": "Abby Finkenauer, then-US Representative for Iowa's 1st congressional district (which encompasses Cedar Rapids and other hard-hit areas), used her local office for an assistance event, personally handing out essentials such as food, water, and toiletries until supplies ran out.[10] Finkenauer's challenger in the 2020 United States House of Representatives elections, then-Iowa State Representative Ashley Hinson criticized her opponent for showing images of these events in a campaign ad, with the Republican Party of Iowa calling it \"disgraceful\". The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee returned the criticism, saying that while Hinson had released a stereotypical ad and posed for storm-related photo ops, Finkenauer actually worked on doing something meaningful at the time. Hinson has since collaborated with local religious and charitable groups.[142] Ernst and her Democratic challenger in that year's election, Theresa Greenfield, both provided assistance. Greenfield handed out supplies, served food, and toured damage. Ernst helped distribute food with local charities including Meals on Wheels. Neither politician saw the disaster assistance as optional.[10][142] Reynolds and Hinson both visited the August 21 Operation BBQ Relief event.[133] Political science professors in the state commented. Tim Hagle from the University of Iowa said the key is \"to strike the balance between political grandstanding \u2014 or opportunism \u2014 and a genuine desire to help, which also helps you politically\". Chris Larimer of the University of Northern Iowa concurred, adding that practical help is more likely to earn voter support. At Cornell College, Megan Goldberg said \"an elected official wants to claim credit for disaster relief that is effective, while avoiding blame for any mismanagement of disaster relief\", concluding that \"even a candidate or official who genuinely wants to visit a site \u2014 either to help or to gather information \u2014 has to think about how the visit can be spun to his or her political advantage, and how to reply to criticisms of such visits. But that's the way it often is these days.\"[142]",
      "Possible impact of climate change[edit]": "The severity of the storm raised the question of whether climate change intensified it.[143] A variety of climate experts from Georgia Tech, Colorado University, North Carolina State, and other institutions told the Associated Press, in the wake of the derecho, 2020 wildfire season, and 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, that more intense natural disasters like these are consistent with climate change.[143] Climate change is a possible cause of the intensity of derechos overall, said Iowa State University and National Weather Service (Des Moines) scientists;  experts disagreed if it was responsible for this particular storm. The NWS said it was atypical for such a severe storm to not appear in the previous day's weather models. Additionally, NWS research into derechos indicates weather patterns in the region to be shifting towards the poles, which might be a result of climate change.[144][145] The high damage estimate aligns with analysis showing increases in the costs of natural disasters as a result of climate change-driven storm intensity.[3][146]",
      "Official notices and records[edit]": "The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) did not initially foresee an event of this magnitude, primarily due to sporadic model solutions, more specifically the large variance in intensity, location, and coverage of this derecho.[147] During the 06:00 UTC (1AM CDT) convective outlook update, a slight, or level 2/5 risk for severe thunderstorms was introduced in an area spanning approximately from Kansas to central Illinois due to other severe weather potential, with lower threats in the area eventually hit by the derecho. As model guidance became clearer during the overnight hours, parts of Iowa and Illinois were put under an enhanced (level 3/5) risk at 13:00 UTC (8AM CDT) before the region was further upgraded to a moderate risk (level 4/5) at 16:30 UTC (11:30AM CDT) once the derecho was clearly underway and expected to continue.[148]",

      "1893 San Roque hurricane": " Hurricane San Roque was a destructive tropical cyclone in August 1893 that principally affected Puerto Rico, eastern New England, and Atlantic Canada. Its informal name in Puerto Rico arises from the feast day of Saint Roch, or San Roque in Spanish, which coincided with the hurricane's landfall on that island.[nb 1] It was the third known hurricane of the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the Lesser Antilles. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the Caribbean Sea, and on August 17 struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. The eye crossed the island from southeast to northwest in about seven hours. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. Large numbers of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless, and four people were killed. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. In addition to the intense winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. On August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward, accelerate, and gradually weaken. Although its center remained far from the United States, heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's East Coast on August 20 and 21. Eastern New England experienced conditions akin to a particularly bad nor'easter, with winds as high as 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) recorded on Block Island. Across Rhode Island and Massachusetts, grain crops were flattened and orchards were stripped of their fruits. The racing yacht Volunteer was badly damaged, and a fishing schooner sank off Nantucket; only one of the seven crew members managed to survive, by clinging to debris for 33 hours. Later that day, the now-rapidly moving cyclone made landfall in Nova Scotia. Damage to utility wires in Halifax cut power and communications services, and a child was killed by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout Atlantic Canada, becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".[4] The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the steamship Dorcas and its barge, Etta Stewart, which struck a rocky shoal while underway east of Halifax. Dorcas capsized and was driven ashore, while the barge broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on Trinity Bay in Newfoundland, for a storm total of 37 fatalities.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "Because of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history. According to contemporaneous accounts, it most likely originated in the Intertropical Convergence Zone off the northern coast of South America.[5] In the Atlantic hurricane database, its formation as a tropical storm is entered on August 13, corresponding with the first observation of the system, about 730\u00a0mi (1,170\u00a0km) east of Trinidad and Tobago. It crossed the Lesser Antilles island arc on August 15, passing between Dominica and Guadeloupe.[6] The intensifying cyclone moved toward the northwest and by 18:00 UTC on August 16, it was centered very close to St. Croix.[7] Upon receiving the first report of the storm from Saint Thomas, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued a special bulletin relaying the current position of the hurricane, forecasting its recurvature by August 21, and advising shipping interests to take necessary precautions.[5] At 00:00 UTC on August 17, the cyclone made landfall near Patillas, Puerto Rico, as the equivalent of a Category 3 major hurricane on the modern-day Saffir\u2013Simpson scale.[6][8] Modern reanalysis efforts estimated the intensity at landfall through the severity of wind damage in Puerto Rico, which was consistent with F2 on the Fujita scale.[3] The eye was marked by a period of stark calm as it crossed the island such that during its passage, some people believed the storm to be over.[9] At San Juan, to the north of the center path, barometric pressure fell to 987.8\u00a0mbar (29.17\u00a0inHg).[8] Approximately seven hours after moving ashore, the center exited Puerto Rico between Isabela and Quebradillas.[7][8] On August 18, weather stations along the Atlantic coast of the Southeastern U.S. started to register the hurricane's distant influence.[5] It passed over or close to the Turks and Caicos Islands.[7] While situated northeast of the Bahamas on August 19, the hurricane began its recurvature to the north and ultimately northeast.[6] Late on August 20 and into the following day, gales and heavy rainfall overspread the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts.[5] The hurricane weakened as it gained latitude and early on August 21, it passed approximately 185\u00a0mi (300\u00a0km) east of Cape Hatteras. Later that day, the accelerating storm passed within 150\u00a0mi (240\u00a0km) of Nantucket. At 00:00 UTC on August 22, it was one of four active hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, and the first of three to impact the U.S. East Coast in the span of eight days; Hurricane Four would strike western Long Island on August 24, and Hurricane Six ravaged the Sea Islands on August 28 before moving northward along the Eastern Seaboard.[6][10] Though some modern researchers catalogued the system as a hurricane on its final approach to Nova Scotia, the official Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project found no conclusive evidence of hurricane-force winds in Canada.[7][3] In the early morning hours of August 22, the storm made landfall in Nova Scotia via St. Margarets Bay,[11] as an extratropical cyclone.[6] Its northeasterly path placed greater Halifax in the typically intense right-front quadrant of the storm center; this would not be repeated until Hurricane Juan in 2003.[11] After rapidly crossing Nova Scotia, the extratropical system impacted the island of Newfoundland. Its remnants continued eastward into the North Atlantic for several more days; its documented course ends on August 25.[6]",
      "Impact[edit]": "The intensifying hurricane brought stormy conditions to the Lesser Antilles from Martinique to the Virgin Islands. In Saint Thomas, boats and docks were damaged, trees were blown down, and houses were unroofed.[12][13]",
      "Puerto Rico[edit]": "For the first time in Puerto Rico's history, warning flags were used to alert the public of the approaching hurricane.[8] Officials in San Juan first hoisted cautionary red flags during the mid-morning on August 16, upgraded three hours later to more urgent yellow and blue signals, and finally to black flags to mark the cyclone's onslaught.[14] By mid-afternoon the Port of San Juan was closed; although orders were given to evacuate ships from the port, the short notice and lack of available tugboats meant some vessels had to ride out the storm at anchor, exposed to the elements.[15] Ships at dock were required to be unloaded of their cargo.[12] When the severity of the hurricane became clear, local officials ensured moorings were secure and orchestrated the positioning of ships to minimize risk of collisions.[9] Bus and tram services were suspended as conditions worsened, leaving many residents unable to reach their homes for the night.[9] On the night of August 16\u201317, winds of 55\u00a0mph (89\u00a0km/h) and 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) were recorded in San Juan and Mayag\u00fcez, respectively, before both recording anemometers were blown away.[7] It was the long duration of the storm, rather than its intensity alone, which made it so destructive.[13] The northern coast suffered most as the storm wrought havoc on crops, telegraph infrastructure, and buildings of varying construction quality.[15] Poorly built shacks and huts, the residences of impoverished workers, fared the worst.[14] In Camuy, the storm destroyed up to 20 houses, uprooted trees, and sparked two small fires; in the aftermath, the mayor appointed a special commission to facilitate the transfer of relief funds to storm victims. Many of the homeless families received donations from neighbors to help cover basic expenses. The winds unroofed many small huts near the shore of Arecibo, forcing their residents to flee for cover, and knocked down wooden and brick fences. The local telegraph station was rendered inoperative, slowing the initial spread of damage reports.[15] Both the city and outlying rural areas of Manat\u00ed incurred widespread damage, with dozens of thatch roofs blown off and some homes left uninhabitable. The basement of a colectur\u00eda, or tithe barn, was provided as temporary shelter to poor and injured storm victims. Numerous people in Hatillo were left homeless, and reports there described trees being blown far from where they once stood.[15] Severe damage befell Vega Baja, with at least 28 houses destroyed and many banana, coconut, and other fruit trees toppled.[16] Eight houses were destroyed in Isabela, and one family required rescue after its home was crushed under the dislocated roof of an adjacent building. Many poor families became homeless; some were offered shelter in the homes of local government and Civil Guard officials.[16] A church atrium in the town was destroyed.[17] Many more peasant huts were destroyed in Bayam\u00f3n, along with the roofs of more substantial structures. All telegraph wires and poles in the community were blown down.[15] Seven or eight houses were destroyed in Trujillo Alto.[18] The effects proved less severe than feared in Utuado, though banana plantations suffered.[16] In Dorado, numerous houses were damaged and six were destroyed, their residents forced to seek shelter in government buildings.[15] The storm was not as severe in San Juan as in other towns, although destruction remained widespread. One hospital was badly damaged, with the roof over the maternity ward peeled away. Timbers and metal roofing tiles were blown a great distance from the structure, and patients had to be transferred to a nearby military hospital. Another hospital in the Puerta de Tierra subbarrio was also unroofed.[19] With telegraph wires downed in all directions, San Juan initially had no contact with the rest of the island.[9] Many gas lanterns were broken. Palm and fruit trees were uprooted throughout the city, while garden fences and awnings were blown down. Many houses, huts, businesses, and public facilities around San Juan sustained varying degrees of structural damage.[9] Several houses in the nearby town of Cata\u00f1o were demolished.[19] Heavy rainfall lasted two to three days in some locations.[19] San Juan recorded 2.36\u00a0in (60\u00a0mm) of precipitation.[8] Further inland, rivers overflowed their banks with the torrential rainfall, inundating wide tracts of low-lying terrain.[15] Among the major rivers flooded were the R\u00edo Grande de Arecibo, R\u00edo Grande de Manat\u00ed, and Santiago. Floodwaters ruined harvests of crops like rice, corn, and sugar cane.[15] One farmer in Humacao, near the eastern coast, reported the loss of about 80 acres (32\u00a0ha) of sugar cane fields.[16] The neighborhood of Marina in Gurabo had to be evacuated due to river flooding. The mayor of the town started a donation drive for poor families. One worker on a hacienda died, and his burial was delayed until flooding in the local cemetery receded.[16] Many railways and thoroughfares, including the road between Cata\u00f1o and Bayam\u00f3n, were made impassable by both fallen trees and deep floodwaters.[19] With mail routes blocked and telegraph communications severed, the full extent of the destruction was slow to be revealed.[14] On the day after the storm, workers began to clear railways and reestablish communications.[15] Several ships were destroyed and others left stranded on the beach. The schooner Enriqueta broke free and crashed into a pier; the sloop Tomasito grounded out, crushing its keel; and another sloop, the Maria Artau, went ashore at Palo Seco, with all hands saved by another crew.[19][9] At Arecibo, the British schooner Robbie Godfrey broke free from its moorings in port while being loaded with sugar. The ship was driven aground and destroyed, along with its cargo, but all hands were able to reach the shore with the assistance of rescue brigades. One crewman was hospitalized for an arm injury.[15][19] The schooner Martiniguesi, loaded with cattle en route to Martinique, went ashore at Maunabo, with one crewman and numerous head of cattle killed.[16] The sloop Pepito was lost at Cata\u00f1o.[19] Sea baths along the shore were destroyed.[9] Among all agricultural losses, that of the year's coffee crop was most significant.[8] Losses to the coffee harvest in Lares alone were estimated at 500,000 Puerto Rican pesos. In some localities, only crops in sheltered valleys survived.[16] As much as 60% of the coffee harvest was lost to the storm in Comer\u00edo.[20] The storm was locally referred to as \"San Roque\" since it began on the feast day of Saint Roch, known as San Roque in Spanish.[7][9] It was among the last significant tropical cyclones to affect Puerto Rico before the island came under United States rule in 1898.[13] Some contemporary accounts drew comparisons to the devastating San Felipe hurricane of 1876.[16] The hurricane caused four known fatalities in Puerto Rico.[8]",
      "United States[edit]": "On the far western periphery of the hurricane, parts of Florida experienced gusty winds, reaching 35\u00a0mph (56\u00a0km/h) in Key West and 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) in Jupiter, on August 20. A closer pass by New England the following day resulted in severe nor'easter-like conditions, with winds peaking at 72\u00a0mph (116\u00a0km/h) on Block Island and 52\u00a0mph (84\u00a0km/h) on Nantucket. In Woods Hole, Massachusetts, winds up to 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) were reported. Tropical storm-force winds extended north to Eastport.[7] The Hartford Courant described the hurricane \"the most severe August storm known for many years\" in Chatham;[21] in Oak Bluffs (then called Cottage City) on Martha's Vineyard, it was \"without a precedent during the summer season\" according to The Boston Globe.[22] The U.S. Weather Bureau had predicted bad weather for several days, and warning signals were raised along the coast 24 hours before onset. Consequently, shipping interests generally endured the storm without major losses.[23] Throughout Cape Cod and the Islands, trees, fences, and utility wires were blown down. Apple and pear trees were stripped of their fruit, and vegetable crops suffered. Floodwaters inundated streets and cellars while the driving rain forced its way inside east-facing walls.[21][22] Many roads were littered with the broken branches of large trees; some smaller trees and shrubs were uprooted entirely.[23] Part of the Nantucket Railroad was washed out at Tom Nevers Head, and wharves on the island received minor damage.[24] In the mid-morning on August 21, the Portland, Maine-based fishing schooner Mary Lizzie sank in heavy seas off Nantucket. Six of the seven crew members drowned. The one survivor held to floating debris for 33 hours until he was rescued by a passing steamship.[25][26] The racing yacht Volunteer, winner of the 1887 America's Cup, broke free from her anchorage and was tossed onto the rocks near the entrance to Hadley's Harbor on Naushon Island, Massachusetts. Pounding seas battered the vessel, breaking up much of its deck and flooding the hull. After an unsuccessful attempt by another yacht to rescue Volunteer with the storm still raging, a tugboat was able to dislodge the stricken craft and tow her to a nearby wharf.[21][23] The storm disabled several ships around Martha's Vineyard, including the schooners Sarah Louise and Clara Jane, both of which were damaged, and the sloop Cassie, left stranded on the shore. Numerous other fishing vessels lost their anchors, sails, or seine fishing boats. The maritime havoc extended westward to New Jersey's Sandy Hook, where a yacht was wrecked.[22] President Grover Cleveland sheltered in his summer home of Gray Gables  during the storm. His yacht was narrowly saved from being swept ashore.[23] Rainfall in Boston commenced in the late evening of August 20 and continued through the following afternoon, totaling 1.65\u00a0in (42\u00a0mm); the Charles River breached its banks, flooding the Cambridgeport neighborhood of Cambridge up to 3\u00a0ft (0.9\u00a0m) deep. At Nantasket Beach in the town of Hull, immense swells drew crowds of onlookers, photographers, and artists before the surf action began damaging boardwalks and carnival game booths. Roads in Plymouth were littered with broken tree limbs, and several pleasure craft in Plymouth Harbor were blown aground.[23] Great damage to grain crops also plagued the neighboring state of Rhode Island.[23][27] Two sailors were rescued after their boat capsized in Newport Harbor. A fishing schooner drifted to sea with its crew aboard; it was ultimately rescued by a tug south of the Brenton Reef Light. Numerous ships rode out the storm in the shelter of Dutch Island in the West Passage of Narragansett Bay, being \"tossed like cockle shells on the swirling waters\" as described by the Fall River Daily Evening News .[28] One of Ethel Swift's two anchor chains broke, resulting in a wreck on the western shore of the bay. The schooner's crew of four was safely rescued.[28] Further up the bay, three ships were blown aground on Prudence Island.[27]  A yacht race set for August 21 around Newport was postponed because of the bad weather.[29] Some 17 fire alarm call boxes in Charlestown, Rhode Island, were rendered inoperative, so firefighters had to patrol the town continuously through the night of August 20\u201321.[27]",
      "Canada[edit]": "Though in a weakened state, the cyclone battered the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Writing for Cape Breton's Magazine, Michael L. MacDonald wrote that it was \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".[4] There, the storm came to be known as the \"Second Great August Gale\", in reference to a catastrophic hurricane in August 1837.[11][30] Throughout the Maritimes, dozens of large ships were stranded or destroyed.[4] Warning signals were hoisted in Nova Scotia on the evening of August 20, and ultimately lowered near midday on August 22.[31] In Halifax, rain and wind began in the early afternoon on August 21 and grew in severity through the night. The city was plunged into darkness and cut off from the outside world as electricity and communications wires fell. Severed power lines sparked small fires and posed a hazard to public safety; a young girl was electrocuted and killed by a live wire, and two more people received non-life-threatening shocks while attempting to recover her body. Parks, public gardens, and cemeteries throughout the city suffered extensive damage, with many large trees destroyed.[32] Many ships and boats were wrecked or blown ashore in Halifax Harbour. In one instance, after colliding with a wharf and being struck by two pontoon boats, the schooner Janie R.'s cargo of lime swelled with the influx of seawater such that the ship burst open.[33] Trees were uprooted and chimneys toppled in Liverpool.[31] The storm was less severe in Yarmouth, at the western end of the province, but still washed out streets and blew down trees.[33] The winds damaged trees, fences, and some buildings in Amherst, and flattened crops in the surrounding countryside.[33] In Cumberland County, the Palmerston Bridge over the upper Pugwash Harbor was badly damaged, and two barques were blown ashore at Northport.[33] Several schooners were wrecked along the shores of Cape Breton;[33] in Ingonish, two ships were left stranded on the shore and six fishing boats drifted out to sea. Residents of the rural community fled their homes at the height of the storm to seek shelter in nearby valleys.[31] Late on the night of August 21, the steamship Dorcas, with barge Etta Stewart in tow, wrecked on the notoriously hazardous reef surrounding Shut-In Island, near the entrance to Three Fathom Harbour.[4][34] Both vessels were loaded with coal en route from Sydney to Halifax. It is likely that the barge took on water in the heavy seas, making it impossible to steer and causing both ships to drift inexorably toward shore in the strong southerly winds.[4] After hitting the rocks, the steamer overturned, losing its engine, boilers, and cargo, and came to rest inverted on the beach. The barge broke up, littering the shore with timbers.[4][34] All crew-members and passengers, totaling 24 people, were killed: Dorcas carried a crew of 10, plus the chief engineer's pregnant wife and 4 children in their care, while 8 crewmen and one passenger were on Etta Stewart.[4][35] All bodies but one were recovered. The small community of Louisbourg, home to 16 of the victims and many of their families, was left reeling, and a rare government inquiry into the disaster was opened; it concluded that the wreck was beyond the control of Captain Angus Ferguson of Dorcas, who \"sacrificed his own life in his endeavour to save those on board the two vessels\".[4]  The commissioner of the inquiry acknowledged that cutting the barge free may have increased the chance of survival for the crew and passengers of Dorcas, but dismissed this as a viable option: \"It may be considered by some that it would have been more prudent and wise for the master of the Dorcas to have disconnected his steamer from the barge at some safe time before approaching the breakers, in order to enable his vessel to reach off shore and thus have made an effort to save the larger number of people on board the steamer at the sacrifice of the less number of people on board the barge.\"Had Captain Ferguson, however, acted in such a manner and been successful in saving the steamer with those on board, he would have forever been branded as a coward when he reached the land and laid himself open to the serious charge of deliberately and wilfully sacrificing the lives of many human beings for the sake of saving his own. To a brave man this would have been intolerable and it must be acknowledged that in acting as he did he displayed the genuine characteristics of a noble seaman, when, amidst the dangers of such a hurricane and wild sea, he met death at the post of duty.\"[4] Despite the tragedy at Shut-In Island, the loss of life in Nova Scotia was considered low relative to the large number of shipwrecks.[35][36] Extensive storm damage, including downed trees and telegraph wires, collapsed barns, and sunk vessels along the coast, was reported in parts of New Brunswick.[33] At Point Escuminac, winds blew at 60 to 62\u00a0mph (97 to 100\u00a0km/h) for three hours and many fishing boats were blown ashore. A similar situation presented itself further north in Shippagan.[31] The cyclone severed communications between Prince Edward Island and the mainland, and inflicted widespread damage upon the province. Streets in the capital city of Charlottetown were strewn with downed tree limbs; in rural sectors, barns were destroyed. A stretch of breakwater in Souris was washed out.[33] Fishing boats in Tignish were shattered.[31] In Perc\u00e9, on the eastern tip of Quebec's Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, 14 fishing vessels were destroyed.[31] The extratropical remnants of the cyclone continued to produce strong winds over Newfoundland, ruining crops and damaging homes that were under construction. The sinking of a boat in Trinity Bay resulted in the drowning deaths of two men, including member of the General Assembly of Newfoundland, David C. Webber.[36] St. John's reported powerful winds that toppled trees.[31]",

      "Contents": "",
      "Typhoon Isa": "Typhoon Isa was the first of a record eleven super typhoons to occur during the 1997 Pacific typhoon season. The second tropical cyclone of the season, Isa developed from a disturbance in the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands on April 12. It moved erratically at first, though after attaining tropical storm status it curved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north. Isa very gradually intensified, and on April 20 the typhoon reached peak 1-min winds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph), as reported by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center; Japan Meteorological Agency reported maximum 10-min winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph). After turning northward, it accelerated to the northeast, and merged with a larger extratropical cyclone on April 24. Early in its duration, Isa caused light rainfall and moderate winds on Pohnpei. Later, a stationary rainband from the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation on Guam during its dry season. Damage in the Guam National Weather Service area of responsibility totaled $1\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD$, 1.9\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD), the majority of it from crop damage. No deaths were reported.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In early April, the monsoon trough established itself across Micronesia near the equator. An area of convection within the trough developed in the Caroline Islands on April 9, and resembled the characteristics of a monsoon depression. Shortly thereafter, a large, yet weak low-level circulation formed within the system. The system drifted erratically for several days as it slowly organized; the system underwent several cycles of developing and losing convection. On April 11, the system maintained a persistent area of well-organized deep convection, and subsequent to an increase in upper-level outflow, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W at 1800\u00a0UTC on April 11. Strong influence from the monsoonal westerlies left the depression drifting and slowly executing a loop to the northwest. Based on sufficient satellite classifications, JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isa early on April 12 while it was located 105\u00a0km (65\u00a0mi) of Pohnpei.[1] The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) simultaneously classified the system as a tropical depression and upgraded it to a tropical storm early on April 13.[2] With the subtropical ridge to its north,[3] Isa tracked to the north and gradually curved to the west. It slowly intensified, due to it being a large tropical cyclone, and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status;[1] at the same time, JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm, and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16.[2] Isa maintained a nearly due-westward movement, although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn to the north. The JTWC recognized the northward model bias, which was described as under-analyzing the strength of the subtropical ridge. By April 16, the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category\u00a03 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and despite a potential threat to Guam the typhoon remained 260\u00a0km (160\u00a0mi) south of the island. It gradually curved to the north, and on April 20 JTWC classified Super Typhoon Isa as reaching peak 1-min winds of 270\u00a0km/h (170\u00a0mph). At this point, Isa became an annular typhoon, with a large eye and a lack of spiralform rainbands, while moving nearly due northward, through a weakness in the subtropical ridge.[1] Simultaneously, JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10-min winds of 155\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph).[2] Shortly after peaking in intensity, Isa began to weaken, and by April 21 it dropped below \"super typhoon\" status. It accelerated to the northeast under the flow of the mid-latitudes, and the typhoon weakened more rapidly;[1] JMA downgraded Isa to a tropical storm on April 22,[2] which was followed suit by the JTWC the next day as upper-level wind shear increased. At 0600\u00a0UTC on April 23, the JTWC issued the last advisory on the system,[1] and the next day JMA classified Isa dissipated as it became absorbed by a cloud band from a large extratropical cyclone to the east of Japan.[1][2]",
      "Impact[edit]": "Isa first affected Pohnpei as a tropical storm on April 12. While passing near the island, the storm produced moderate winds across the island, peaking at 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph). The winds downed several trees and tree limbs which destroyed 40% of the island's power lines. A few buildings reported roof damage. About 15% of the crops on Pohnpei were damaged, including losses to the banana and breadfruit crops.[4] After the passage of the typhoon, President of the Federated States of Micronesia Jacob Nena declared Pohnpei as a major disaster area due to the damage from Typhoon Isa and subsequent flooding; on April 20 heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides and 19\u00a0fatalities on the island, though they were not related to Isa.[4][5] In Guam, the threat of Typhoon Isa postponed a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48\u00a0hours. The flight was the last in Operation Pacific Haven\u00a0[de], which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600\u00a0Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States.[6][7] The threat of the typhoon also canceled the first round of the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history.[8][9] Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15\u201325\u00a0cm (6\u201310\u00a0in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season,[1] and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April.[10] The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86\u00a0km/h (53\u00a0mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and soybean crops.[4] Typhoon Isa later dropped light rainfall on the island of Rota.[10] Across its path, damage from the storm totaled over $1\u00a0million (1997\u00a0USD, $1.9\u00a0million 2024\u00a0USD). No deaths or injuries were reported.[4]",

      "Cyclone Yasa": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasa was the second Category 5 severe tropical cyclone in 2020 after Harold in the 2019\u201320 South Pacific cyclone season. Yasa was the second tropical disturbance, as well as the first tropical cyclone and severe tropical cyclone of the 2020\u201321 South Pacific cyclone season. Yasa was first noted as an area of low pressure to the north of Port Vila in Vanuatu during December 10. Over the next few days, the system gradually developed further as it absorbed Tropical Depression 01F, before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Yasa by the Fiji Meteorological Service on December 13. The system gradually moved through the South Pacific Ocean, going through a small, slow loop whilst rapidly intensifying. In about a day, it became a Category\u00a05 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale and a few hours later, a Category\u00a05-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with 1-minute sustained winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and a minimum pressure of 917\u00a0hPa (27.1\u00a0inHg). This made Yasa the earliest Category 5 tropical cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson scales in the South Pacific basin since reliable records began, beating the old record by Cyclone Zoe in 2002\u201303. Yasa maintained its intensity and became more defined on satellite imagery as it bore down on Fiji. An address was sent to the entire country from the nation's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama regarding preparations for the storm. Shipping services were halted, and fishermen were advised to not go out into sea, due to fears of Yasa possibly injuring or killing them. Multiple warnings were issued, including heavy rain, heavy wind, and flood warnings. Soon, the entirety of Fiji was under warnings as Yasa neared. A high wind warning was put in place for Vanuatu as the storm's wind field reached the country. Impacts began to be felt on mid-day December 16, as villages in the Malolo and Yasawa groups began to feel the winds and rain of Yasa. The impacts felt from Yasa were large and wide. As of December 22, impacted areas are beginning to restore communication. Transportation was hampered as 72 roads in the country were closed due to fallen trees, power lines, and flooding. Heavy rain was recorded in most of the country. Four deaths were confirmed, while one person remains missing.[1] Damage estimates in Fiji were calculated at a minimum total of FJ$500 million, or US$246.7 million (2020 USD).[2] Many affected people had their access to food and water cut off following Yasa's passage through Fiji. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies provided funding and relief items to about 17,700 Fijians by December 18, and provided the Fijian Ministry of Health and Medical Services with supplies. Australia pledged its assistance and sent HMAS Adelaide to help with recovery efforts.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "The area of low pressure that would eventually become Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasa was first noted by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) during December 10, while it was located about 655\u00a0km (405\u00a0mi) to the north of Port Vila in Vanuatu.[3][4] At this stage, the disturbance had a broad and fully exposed low level circulation, with little to no atmospheric convection surrounding the system.[3] The system was also located within a marginally favourable environment for further development, with high levels of vertical wind shear, being offset by warm sea surface temperatures of around 29\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u201386\u00a0\u00b0F).[3] During that day, the system gradually organized further as it moved south-eastwards, before it was classified as Tropical Disturbance 02F by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 11.[4][5][6] During that day, the system continued to develop and was classified as a tropical depression by the FMS, while Tropical Depression 01F/04P moved along its southern periphery.[7][8] The JTWC subsequently initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 05P during December 12.[9] Over the next day, the system continued to consolidate and absorbed Tropical Depression 01F, as it moved south-westwards along the northeastern edge of a subtropical ridge of high pressure.[10] During December 13, the FMS classified the system as a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Yasa, while it was located over open waters between Fiji and Vanuatu.[5][11] After it had been named, Yasa made a small anti-cyclonic loop, while its overall organisation improved significantly, with a compact eye feature appearing on microwave imagery.[5][12][13] As a result, the FMS reported that the system had intensified into a Category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Yasa had become equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS).[4][12] Yasa subsequently performed a second anti-cyclonic loop as the subtropical ridge weakened, while its primary steering mechanism started to change, which caused the system to move north-eastwards towards the Equator.[5][14][15] During December 14, the FMS reported that Yasa had become a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone, before the system rapidly intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone later that day.[5] During December 15, Yasa continued to rapidly intensify with its eye becoming well defined, before the FMS reported that the system had become the earliest Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on record.[16][17]  The system subsequently turned south-eastwards as a subtropical ridge of high pressure built in from the cyclones southeast before a ridge of high pressure near the equator caused the system to start moving south-eastwards towards Fiji.[5][18][19] The JTWC reported that Yasa had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane on the SSHWS during December 16.[4][20] Later that day, the FMS reported that Yasa had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 230\u00a0km/h (140\u00a0mph), as well as a minimum pressure of 917\u00a0hPa (27.08\u00a0inHg), although it was operationally assessed at 250\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph), and a minimum pressure of 899\u00a0hPa (26.55\u00a0inHg).[21] The system subsequently started to weaken with its cloud tops starting to warm before Yasa made landfall in Bua Province on Vanua Levu as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, at around 06:00\u00a0UTC (18:00\u00a0FJT) on December 17.[22][23] After it had made landfall, Yasa's eye became cloud-filled and dissipated, as it completed an eyewall replacement cycle over Vanua Levu.[24][25] The system subsequently moved into the Koro Sea, where it passed near or over several of the Lau Islands and started to interact with an upper-level trough of low pressure.[4][25] This caused increased vertical wind shear over the system, which in turn caused Yasa to significantly weaken and become a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone during December 18.[25][26][27] Over the next couple of days, the system gradually weakened further, as it brushed Tonga with hurricane-force winds, before it was classified as a former tropical cyclone by the FMS during December 19 as it degenerated into an extratropical low.[4][28][29] Over the next few days, the JTWC continued to monitor Yasa as a subtropical cyclone, before the system was last noted during December 24.[4][30]",
      "Preparations[edit]": "",
      "Fiji[edit]": "As Yasa moved across Fiji, a village elder in Yasawa stated that some of their farms had been destroyed.[51] Parts of Rakiraki and Labasa were flooded.[52][53] The cyclone struck Vanua Levu destroying homes in Tabia, Vunivau, Dreketi and Nabouwalu.[54] Dreketi Primary School and other schools in Vanua Levu were severely damaged.[55][56] Communications from impacted areas were lost on December 17.[57] A total of 72 roads were closed around the country as a result of fallen trees, broken powerlines, floodwaters and landslides.[58] In Belego Savusavu, 15 homes were destroyed and water and electricity supply was disrupted.[59] Parts of Bua were inaccessible due to fallen trees, landslides and damaged roads.[60] Massive landslides occurred along the Dreketi-Nabouwalu Highway.[61] According to FBC News, Labasa, Savusavu, Koro and Ovalau suffered minimal damage.[62] Across Fiji's northern regions, crops were damaged and/or destroyed.[63] In Kubulau Bua, strong winds and heavy rains that lasted for more than 6 hours (longer than Winston) destroyed about 60 houses.[64] A 45-year-old man and an infant in Labasa were killed when a home collapsed.[65] More than 93,000 Fijians \u2013 over 10% of the population[66] \u2013 were impacted by the storm, and around 23,000 were required to go to evacuation centers.[65] Over 4,200 houses were damaged or destroyed.[66] Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama stated that the damage would likely surpass that of Cyclone Winston in 2016, additionally tweeting that \"This is not normal. This is a climate emergency.\"[67] Reports showed that much of the homes in villages were completely destroyed and crops were flattened by the extensive wind brought in by Yasa.[67] As with many disasters during the COVID-19 pandemic, recovery was anticipated to be much harder and slower due to restrictions and measures still needed to be taken while thousands remained in evacuation centers.[68] Damage to agriculture across the nation reached FJ$150\u00a0million (US$73\u00a0million).[69] Costs to repair and restore damage to Energy Fiji Limited's power infrastructure reached FJ$7\u20138\u00a0million (US$3.4\u20133.9\u00a0million).[70] Damage to medical infrastructure reached FJ$2.5\u00a0million (US$1.2\u00a0million), including FJ$1.5\u00a0million (US$730,000) for the destruction of Kia Island's only nursing station.[71] A damage survey performed later in February 2021 indicated total damage was upwards of FJ$500 million, or US$246.7 million, with 2,141 homes completely destroyed and another 6,184 partially damaged.[2]",
      "Elsewhere[edit]": "As the storm began to impact Vanuatu, a strong wind warning was put in effect for central and southern coastal areas of the country.[49] As Yasa passed to the west of Tonga on December 18, tropical cyclone warnings were raised for the entirety of the country.[50] Officials warned of winds up to hurricane force on Tongatapu and \u02bbEua.[50] Other regions of the country were forecast to experience torrential rainfall, swells up to 6 meters high, and violent storm force winds throughout the day.[50]",
      "Impact[edit]": "",
      "Tonga[edit]": "Since Yasa took a slightly more western track than anticipated, much of the country of Tonga was left spared by the cyclone. The Island of Vava\u02bbu reported minor damage to fruit crops and Kava plants.[72] Around 90 in quarantine due to COVID-19 at a camp in Vaini, Tongatapu were required to be evacuated to Fua'amotu (a remote village in Nuku\u02bbalofa) due to Yasa.[72]",
      "Aftermath[edit]": "Shortly after Yasa made landfall in Fiji, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) released information on initial emergency relief funds for the storm. The funds of 86,000 Swiss Francs ($97,000 USD), were used to provide first aid, shelter materials, tarpaulins, hygiene kits, household items, and safe water to more than 17,700 people.[73] The Ministry of Health and Medical Services was provided with Inter-Agency Emergency Health Kits, and other medical and health supplies. Many WASH kits, school in a boxes, and school boxes were stored at a warehouse in Brisbane, Australia, to be sent to Fiji. Meanwhile, some of the same supplies were prepositioned in Fiji ahead of the storm.[74] A Royal New Zealand Air Force reconnaissance flight flew over the areas affected to further assess damage; the disaster zone was compared to that of a \"war zone\".[75] The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne released a statement on December 19 pledging that Australia would provide emergency humanitarian relief in whatever capacity possible with their condolences and thoughts with every person effected by the cyclone.[76] Payne further affirmed that \"Throughout our long history of cooperation, Fiji and Australia have become more than just neighbors \u2013 we are family.  [...] Australia pledges our ongoing support to our Fijian vuvale following TC Yasa.\"[76][77] Australia's HMAS Adelaide, carrying personnel from the Australian Army's 6th Engineering Support Regiment and equipment was sent to assist Fiji in its recovery efforts.[78] Many families across affected areas lost access to food, and were left without it just before the Christmas season. Waves higher than 3 meters (9.8 feet) prevented ships from leaving Suva, on the island of Viti Levu. The environmental NGO 350 in Fiji's secretary, Genevieve Jiva, said that Fijians are \"literally fighting for our survival\" after the storm's passing.[63]",
      "Retirement[edit]": "Due to its onslaught, the name Yasa was retired from the naming list and was replaced by Yabaki.[79]",

      "Cyclone Hola": " Severe Tropical Cyclone Hola had significant effects across Vanuatu in March 2018, resulting in the deaths of three people. Forming as a broad tropical disturbance on 5 March, the system slowly consolidated over the next few days before developing into a tropical cyclone on 6 March. Afterwards, a pinhole eye began to emerge and rapid intensification ensued. Cyclone Hola caused extensive damage in Vanuatu, damaging or destroying 1,709\u00a0structures, ruining crops, and killing three people. Impacts were most severe in Ambrym where half of the areas homes were damaged and people suffered from food shortages. Ambae, already dealing with the disruptive effects of a volcanic eruption, had major damage. Several other provinces reported varying degrees of lesser impact. Fiji, New Caledonia, and New Zealand were also affected by the cyclone. The former two experienced negligible effects while the latter saw heavy rain and strong winds. Effects in New Zealand were less than initially feared, and local media called it a \"lucky escape\".",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "In early March 2018, a trough of low pressure extended across Fiji, resulting in inclement weather across a broad area. A poorly organized low developed within this trough to the northwest of Fiji, later being classified as Tropical Disturbance 03F by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS).[1][2] The system produced persistent convection as it moved generally west-northwest toward Vanuatu under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the south.[3] By 5\u00a0March, winds up to gale-force winds developed around the circulation and the FMS classified it as a tropical depression.[4] Around the same time, the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center also classified the system as a tropical depression, assigning it the identifier 12P.[5] The following day, convection became increasingly organized and consolidated around the cyclone's center with banding features forming around its periphery.[6][7] Satellite scatterometer data showed an area of gale-force winds along the north-eastern side of the storm and with the aforementioned development, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical cyclone with its center located 210\u00a0km (130\u00a0mi) north-northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu.[6] Similarly, the FMS upgraded the depression to a Category\u00a01 tropical cyclone and assigned it the name Hola.[8] Overall environmental conditions favored further intensification, marked by ample outflow aloft, high sea surface temperatures of 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), and moderate wind shear that was mitigated by the storm's westward trajectory.[6] Conditions soon became even more favorable as shear decreased, raising the likelihood of rapid intensification.[9] Indeed Hola strengthened quickly as it approached north-eastern Vanuatu, with SSMIS imagery depicting a formative eye feature and winds reaching storm-force winds late on 6\u00a0March.[8][9] Hola crossed the islands of Ambrym and Pentecost on 6\u20137\u00a0March;[8] interaction with the land masses of Vanuatu disrupted the storm's core temporarily.[10] The system subsequently passed over the island of Malekula and moved into the Coral Sea during 7 March, where it rapidly consolidated and developed a 10\u00a0km (5\u00a0mi) pinhole eye.[11][12] The FMS subsequently reported that Gita had become a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone and predicted that Hola would peak as a Category 5 Severe Tropical Cyclone.[13] However, during the following day Hola's eye weakened and became cloud filled, as it stalled to the west of Vanuatu. As a result, the FMS reported that the system had peaked as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 165\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph). During 8 March, the JTWC also reported that Hola had peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 185\u00a0km/h (115\u00a0mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.[14]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "During the nascent stages of the cyclone in early March, heavy rain alerts were issued for the entirety of Fiji with accumulations in excess of 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) likely.[1][15][16] Rains from the trough and associated disturbance affected Fiji from 1\u20136\u00a0March.[17] M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France raised a pre-cyclone alert for the whole of New Caledonia on 7\u00a0March.[18] A level 2 alert, the second highest, was issued for Lifou, Mar\u00e9, and Ouv\u00e9a on 9\u00a0March, prompting the closure of businesses and schools.[19] Initial reports upon the passage of Hola indicated minimal damage across the territory.[20]",
      "Vanuatu[edit]": "During the cyclone's passage, the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazard Department issued a \"red alert\" for Malampa, Penama, Sanma, and Shefa provinces.[18] Airports and schools were shuttered across the nation.[21] Nationwide damage assessments revealed 1,467\u00a0 homes damaged or destroyed, 83\u00a0community buildings damaged or destroyed, and 159\u00a0schools affected. Crops suffered upwards of 70\u201390\u00a0percent damage in the affected regions.[22] Malampa Province was hardest-hit, with Ambrym sustaining the most significant damage.[21] An estimated 50\u00a0percent of homes on the island were damaged, of which about 80\u00a0percent were made with local materials. The Nebul Health Centre sustained some damage. Extensive damage to local crops created food shortages.[23] Approximately 6\u00a0percent of the housing infrastructure across the province was damaged, and agriculture suffered extensive losses. Underwater drinking systems were compromised, leaving residents without access to clean water. The MV Rosali wrecked off the coast of Malakula.[24] Damage across Penama was largely confined to southern Pentecost Island,[24] with multiple homes were damaged or destroyed.[18] There, one person was killed and two others were injured.[25] The island's water supply was damaged and briefly unavailable before being restored by locals. Facilities at the Pangi Health Centre had minor damage.[26] Crops sustained significant losses across Ambae Island.[27] Coinciding with the eruption of the Manaro Voui volcano, heavy rainfall from Hola mixed with heavy ashfall to create acid rain and a 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) accumulation of ash in southern parts of Ambae.[24][28] In April, heavy rainfall from Cyclone Keni caused further damage on the island.[29] Minor damage occurred in Shefa, Sanma, and Tafea provinces, with communications in the latter disrupted in Aneityum.[24] Two children drowned in a swollen river on Espiritu Santo.[30] Following the storm's passage, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office conducted aerial damage assessments and coordinated with local agencies to begin relief efforts.[24] An initial fund of 10\u00a0million vatu (US$90,000) was provided to conduct these surveys.[22] Damage to infrastructure left many areas isolated, with parts of eastern Pentecost only accessible by bush trekking.[22] On 21\u00a0March, Vanuatu Minister of Health Jerome Ludvaune asked the government to declare a major disaster for North Malakula, stating the damage there was similar to Cyclone Pam.[31] By 23\u00a0March, inadequate relief efforts led to victims stealing food in Malekula.[32] By early April distribution of relief goods was underway, with various affected areas receiving 107.5\u00a0kg (237\u00a0lb) of rice, 9,567 cartons of tinned tuna, 27,150\u00a0L (7,170\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of water, 1,600\u00a0L (420\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of gasoline, 243 shelter kits, and 535 tarpaulins. Furthermore, 40\u00a0million vatu (US$360,000) in funds was provided for West and South Ambae toward recovery from Hola and the Manaro Voui volcanic eruption.[22] UNICEF provided 955\u00a0WASH kits, benefiting 4,775\u00a0people. The agency distributed pamphlets in the Bislama language to ensure proper knowledge of the given materials.[29] Nationwide, total fiscal needs were calculated at 632\u00a0million vatu (US$5.66\u00a0million), of which only 14\u00a0percent was allocated for. An increase in mosquitoes carrying Plasmodium vivax occurred in the storm's wake. A small increase in diarrhea also occurred, with 11\u201314 reported cases. Short- and long-term recovery plans for the two disasters totaled 1.1\u00a0billion vatu (US$10.6\u00a0million), with immediate efforts focused on food security and shelter and long-term efforts focused on education.[22] Transform Aid International in conjunction with Baptist Churches Vanuatu provided rice to 53\u00a0families.[33] The China Civil Engineering Construction Company provided logistics assistance to the Malampa Government and supported local community activities.[34] A three-month state of emergency was enacted on 13\u00a0April, with a Joint Police Force deployed for security and assistance.[29] The national government and provincial government of Penma coordinated relocation plans for displaced residents on Ambae with completion expected by 15\u00a0May.[29] Hola contributed to the largest-ever supplemental budget in Vanuatu, with a proposed spending bill of 940\u00a0million vatu (US$8.4\u00a0million).[35]",
      "New Zealand[edit]": "Hola was the third former tropical cyclone in just over a month to impact New Zealand, following Fehi and Gita in February.[36] The New Zealand MetService raised alerts for heavy rain, strong winds, and rough seas in relation to Hola,[37] primarily for northern areas of the country. Local emergency services advised residents to take \"basic precautions\", including clearing of debris, securing loose outdoor furniture, clearing gutters, and checking ship moorings.[38] An estimated 80 surfers took to Mount Maunganui to ride 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) waves on 11\u00a0March;[39] farther offshore, waves were estimated to be 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft). Air New Zealand cancelled flights at Whangarei Airport and Kerikeri Airport while Vector Limited placed crews on standby for possible power outages.[40] Fire and Emergency New Zealand dispersed extra resources to East Coast for rapid response measures.[41] Thirteen families were evacuated from Bella Vista within Tauranga due to concerns over beach erosion.[42] Effects from the cyclone turned out to be less than anticipated, with reporters calling it a \"lucky escape\". Rainfall in some areas exceeded 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in), with 105\u00a0mm (4.1\u00a0in) measured near Tolaga Bay and estimated accumulations of 90 to 100\u00a0mm (3.5 to 3.9\u00a0in) in the Coromandel Range. Winds were strongest at the northern reaches of the North Island, where gusts reached 122\u00a0km/h (76\u00a0mph) in Kaeo. Farther south near Auckland, peak gusts ranged from 60 to 70\u00a0km/h (37 to 43\u00a0mph).[36]",

      "Tropical Depression Josie": "Tropical Depression Josie was a weak tropical system that impacted the Philippine archipelago of Luzon in July 2018, bringing widespread flooding. The tropical depression was classified in the South China Sea on July 20, and steadily moved eastward while gradually intensifying. The storm reached its peak intensity of 1-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) while nearing the northern tip of the Ilocos Region. By July 22, the system moved northward and rapidly weakened. The system was last noted on July 23 to the northeast of Taiwan. Despite being a relatively weak system, Tropical Depression Josie was known for actively enhancing the southwest monsoon that brought widespread flooding over Luzon, Philippines within most of July 2018. In the country, Josie caused \u20b14.66 billion (US$87.4 million) of damages, also killing a total of 16 people. The storm was the second in history since Typhoon Ketsana struck Metro Manila and caused ocean-high flooding since 2009.",
      "Meteorological history[edit]": "On 06:00 UTC of July 20, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began tracking a tropical disturbance that had developed about 402 km (250 mi) south-south east of Hong Kong.[1] Operationally, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression around that same time,[2] however, post-analysis showed that the system strengthened into a weak tropical depression six hours later.[3] Later that day, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert after the system gradually organised.[4] Animated enhanced infrared satellite imagery showed that the system had flaring convection wrapping into its Low-level circulation center.[5] The storm's location over favourable environments with low wind shear and warm sea-surface temperatures prompted the JTWC to upgrade the system to a tropical depression and initiate advisories, receiving the designation of 13W.[5][6] On 00:00 UTC of July 21, the JMA began issuing advisories on the tropical depression, meaning that the system is expected to strengthen to a tropical storm within the next 24 hours.[7] Three hours later, the PAGASA began issuing advisories on the tropical depression, giving the local name Josie.[8] Around the time the PAGASA started tracking the storm, Josie was located in an area of low vertical wind shear of 5-10 knots.[9] This helped organise the storm more as a \"compact system\" with deep convection, despite remaining at tropical depression intensity.[9] However, in a post-analysis report after the season, the JTWC classified Josie as a tropical storm with 1-minute sustained winds of 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph).[10] The JMA only remained the system as a tropical depression with a minimum barometric pressure of 996\u00a0hPa (29.41\u00a0inHg).[11] As Josie neared the northern tip of Luzon, vertical wind shear gradually increased, maintaining the storm's intensity.[12] By 09:00 UTC of July 22, Josie curved northward, and animated satellite imagery showed the storm's structure began to deteriorate. The storm's center became really disorganised.[13] Twelve hours later, the JMA issued its final advisory on Josie, meaning that the JMA no longer expects the system to intensify into a named tropical storm.[14] By the next day, the storm's center became exposed with its last remaining convection being sheared.[15]  Hence, the JMA fully stopped tracking the system on 12:00 UTC of July 23.[16] The JTWC issued their final advisory on the system three hours later.[17]",
      "Preparations and impact[edit]": "On July 21, as soon as the PAGASA began tracking Tropical Depression Josie, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal (TCWS) #1 was issued for the Ilocos Region (Region I), northern Cagayan and the Babuyan Islands.[18] This also meant that local government officials within the area banned sea travel in the eastern seaboards of Luzon, and advised residents to take appropriate actions against flooding and landslides.[19] At that time, the PAGASA warned that light to moderate rainfall was expected in most of Central Luzon, the rest of Mountain Province and the province of Pangasinan, while majority of the country will experience light rainfall with scattered thunderstorms within the next 12 hours.[20] They also warned that all residents residing near creeks, rivers and channels must evacuate, and hence, all bridges and roads were closed in Northern Luzon and in the Cordilleras.[20] The PAGASA later issued a yellow flood warning for Batangas, which meant that flooding was possible with a continuous intense rainfall of about 15\u201330 mm (0.6\u20131.2 in) being observed in an hour.[21] On 5:00 pm local time (09:00 UTC) of the same day, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) issued a \"red alert\" to all member and government agencies towards the areas that are affected, mainly in the northern provinces.[20][22] This red alert means that all member agencies must take action towards immediate help from affected families from torrential rains.[22] Later that day, Pangasinan was under a state of calamity due to widespread flooding,[23] where 1,291 families (or 5,067 individuals) have been temporarily evacuated.[24] In Calatagan, Batangas, a boat got capsized due to rough seas spawned by the enhancement of the monsoon and rescued the 57 passengers and 10 crew members safely.[20] More than 250,000 houses were affected in seven different regions, where a total of 14,551 families (61,674 individuals) were escorted to 302 evacuation centres.[25]",
