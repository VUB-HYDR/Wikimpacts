The Western Governors' Association described the need for NIDIS in a 2004 report, \"Creating a Drought Early Warning System for the 21st Century: The National Integrated Drought Information System\". The NIDIS Act calls for an interagency, multi-partner approach to drought monitoring, forecasting, and early warning, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \nNIDIS\u2019s mission is \"to improve the nation\u2019s capacity to proactively manage drought-related risks, by providing those affected with the best available information and resources to assess the potential for drought and to better prepare for, mitigate, and respond to the effects of drought.\" Toward that end, NIDIS will create a drought early warning system for the nation. \nBuilding the foundation for a national drought early warning system, NIDIS supports eight regional drought early warning systems (DEWS) across the United States, which rely on networks of federal, tribal, state, local, and academic partners to make climate and drought science accessible and useful for decision makers: California-Nevada, Intermountain West, Midwest, Missouri River Basin, Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Southeast, and Southern Plains.\nNIDIS draws on the personnel, experience, and networks of the National Drought Mitigation Center, the NOAA Regional Climate Centers, and the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISAs), among others. Federal agencies and departments partnering in NIDIS include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Geological Survey, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\nNIDIS is building on existing system infrastructure, data, and operational products from various agencies. For example, it incorporates data from the SNOTEL (SNOw TELemetry) network of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service, reservoir and streamflow levels from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and river forecasts from the National Weather Service. It incorporates operational products such as the \"U.S. Drought Monitor\" and the \"Seasonal Drought Outlook\". Researchers are working to help decision-makers in many contexts by making drought monitoring, forecasting, and impacts information available at a variety of spatial scales and geopolitical boundaries, including regional, watershed, county and tribal. NIDIS is a prototype for information services, in support of preparing for and adapting to climate variation and change. \nIn late 2007, NIDIS launched the U.S. Drought Portal, or drought.gov, a website that pulls together many federal, state, and academic resources for monitoring drought. In January 2021, NIDIS worked with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information to launch a completed redesigned U.S. Drought Portal. The new website features updated content and new interactive architecture designed to provide actionable, shareable information and easy-to-understand graphics describing current drought conditions and forecasts by city, county, state, zip code, and at watershed to global scales. The U.S. Drought Portal also aggregates and presents drought impact data for economic sectors such as agriculture, energy, water utilities, and recreation using interactive maps and data.\nThe NIDIS Program is supported by the NOAA Climate Program Office and is housed at the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratories in Boulder, Colorado.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

They frequently stress water availability by depleting soil moisture, reducing stream flows, lowering lake and reservoir levels, and diminishing groundwater supplies. This ultimately affects several economic activities including for example, decreased agricultural production, less hydro-electric power generation, and increased freshwater transportation costs. Droughts also create major environmental hazards such as reduced water quality, wetland loss, soil erosion and degradation, and ecological habitat destruction.\nAlthough most regions of Canada have experienced drought, many of the southern regions of the Canadian Prairies and interior British Columbia are most susceptible. During the past two centuries, at least 40 droughts have occurred in western Canada with multi-year episodes being observed in the 1890s, 1910s, 1930s, 1960s, 1980s, and the early 2000s. Droughts in southern Ontario/Quebec are usually shorter, smaller in area, less frequent, and less intense. Nonetheless, there have been some major drought occurrences there as well during the 20th century. Droughts in the Atlantic Provinces occur even less frequently. Droughts are less of a concern for northern Canada mainly due to their lower population densities. However, increased frequencies of forest fires during drought years can have serious economic impacts.\nRarely has drought been as serious or extensive as the recent 1999-2004 episode. This was the worst drought for at least a hundred years in parts of the Canadian Prairies. Well below normal precipitation was reported in areas of Alberta and Saskatchewan for more than four consecutive years extending from autumn 1999 to spring 2004. No single year on record between Medicine Hat, Kindersley, and Saskatoon was drier than in 2001. The years 2001 and 2002 may have also brought the first coast-to-coast droughts on record, and were rare as they struck areas less accustomed to dealing with droughts including parts of Atlantic Canada and the northern agricultural prairies (see Figure 1). Canada's Gross Domestic Product fell $5.8 billion for 2001 and 2002. In addition, previously reliable water supplies such as streams, wetlands, reservoirs, and groundwater were placed under stress and often failed. For example, the number of natural Prairie ponds in May 2002 was the lowest on record while in 2001, Great Lakes-St. Lawrence water levels plunged to their lowest point in more than 30 years, thereby significantly increasing marine transportation costs. In British Columbia and Manitoba, hydro-electric generation was curtailed, necessitating additional purchases of power from neighboring jurisdictions. In 2002, the incidence of forest fires in Alberta increased to five times the ten-year average while in summer 2003, populated regions of interior British Columbia were stricken by drought-enhanced fires. Long-lasting impacts include soil degradation by wind erosion and deterioration of grasslands that could take decades and longer to recover.\nHigh surface temperatures intensify droughts by enhancing evapotranspiration in summer, and increasing sublimation and melting of the snowpack during winter. During the 20th century, mean annual air temperature has increased by around 1\u00a0\u00b0C over southern Canada with the greatest warming in the west and the largest rates during winter and spring. Over the same period, annual precipitation has significantly increased over most of southern Canada with the exception of southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. Coincident with the large increases in spring temperature, the 1980s to the present have been associated with rapid reductions in snow cover during the second half of the snow season. Over the last 30 to 50 years, average stream flow has decreased in many parts of Canada with significant reductions in the south. Great Lakes\u2019 water levels have shown substantial variability during the 20th century with no evidence of a long-term trend. Lower levels coincided with the droughts of the 1930s, early 1960s, and the recent 1999-2001 dry period. Over the Prairies, the numbers and water levels of wetlands have shown no clear trend over the last 40 to 50 years.\nIndices used to measure drought show considerable decadal-scale variability with no long-term trends discernible in any portion of the country. Most southern regions of Canada, however, experienced drought conditions during the late 1990s to early 2000s. The worst and most prolonged Canadian Prairie-wide droughts during the instrumental period occurred in the early part of the 20th century (1920s and 1930s). Paleo studies over the southwestern Canadian Prairies using tree ring chronologies dating back to 1597 indicate that the 20th century lacked the prolonged droughts of the 18th and 19th Centuries when droughts were evident for decades at a time.\nCauses.\nAlthough considerable research has been carried out on droughts, there is still no complete theory that explains their formation, persistence, and termination. The major factor in the onset and continuation of drought involves distinctive circulation patterns in the upper atmosphere. Over the Canadian Prairies for example, growing season extended dry periods are associated with a persistent atmospheric circulation pattern that includes a large-amplitude ridge centred over the area. This ridge creates \u2018blocking conditions\u2019 that displace storm tracks away from the area. Drought can also be initiated and/or accentuated during winter when a lack of snowfall results in lower than normal spring runoff and thus, reduced stream flow and reservoir and soil moisture replenishment. Reduced winter precipitation is also caused by persistent atmospheric circulation patterns that involve ridging over the affected area.\nDroughts tend to persist. Warm, dry springs are followed by hot, dry summers; warm summers follow other warm summers; and so on. This relationship is likely related to feedback processes (such as soil moisture anomalies) that enhance or prolong drought situations (however, more research is required to verify this). A significant amount of research on drought in Canada has occurred as a part of the Drought Research Initiative, which focused in a comprehensive manner on the 1999-2005 drought in the Canadian Prairies.\nReasons for the persistence of circulation patterns that lead to drought are not entirely understood but are likely related to surface boundary conditions such as snow and ice cover, vegetation, soil moisture, and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) that force the climate system through variations in their optical and thermal properties. These forcing factors directly influence local to regional atmospheric flow which in turn, can affect large-scale circulation over other areas of the globe (known as teleconnections). For Canada, significant relationships between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events and winter/spring temperature and precipitation have been determined. In general, El Ni\u00f1o is associated with warmer/drier winters while La Ni\u00f1a has an opposite effect. Linkages between Canadian climate and teleconnections such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation are also evident, but mainly during the winter season. Teleconnections during summer are not as strong. However, recent research has shown that some El Ni\u00f1o events are associated with a summer moisture deficit in the western two-thirds of Canada while La Ni\u00f1as produce an abundance of summer moisture in extreme western Canada. The considerable lag between summer moisture and large-scale SSTs provides a basis for developing long-range forecasting of drought conditions in Canada.\nExamples.\nGreater Vancouver has been prone to summer droughts in recent years.\nFuture droughts.\nIn response to the economic and environmental significance of droughts, scientific concern has been expressed regarding climate change impacts on future drought frequency, duration, and severity over various regions of the globe including Canada. Climate models are projecting considerable increases to temperature and in general, small increases to precipitation over southern Canada. This translates into future increases of summer continental interior drying and associated risk of droughts. The increased drought risk is attributed to a combination of increased temperature and potential evapotranspiration not being balanced by precipitation. Note that considerable uncertainty exists with respect to future precipitation, particularly on a regional basis. Furthermore, there is little consensus regarding future changes to teleconnections and since these patterns have a significant impact on temperature and precipitation over Canada, insight into the relative occurrence of future drought remains a huge knowledge gap.\nMonitoring and prediction.\nNumerous indices that measure drought severity are used to monitor drought. These range from those that only consider precipitation, to complex indices that incorporate a water balance approach using precipitation, antecedent soil moisture, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff. For Canada, real-time information on pasture conditions, on-farm surface water supplies, and several drought indices are provided in Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Drought Watch web site. The site monitors the risk and status of drought over major agricultural regions of the country and also promotes practices to reduce drought vulnerability. The North American Drought Monitor has been established as a cooperative effort among drought experts in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. to monitor drought on a weekly basis. The site provides North American maps based on a synthesis of multiple indices and local impacts that best represents current drought conditions.\nDrought prediction involves anticipating climatic anomalies that produce unusually dry conditions for an extended period. Environment Canada produces three-month deterministic temperature and precipitation forecasts for the ensuing 1\u20133, 2\u20134, 4\u20136, 7\u20139, and 10\u201312 days periods. The 1-3 and 2-4 month forecasts are based upon an ensemble of 40 model runs. Probabilistic forecasts, which give estimates of the probability that the seasonal mean will be above, near, or below normal are also provided for the 1-3 and 2-4 month periods. Forecasts for 4\u20136, 7-9 and 10\u201312 months are produced with a statistical method. The forecasts are updated on a monthly basis and posted on the Environment Canada Seasonal Forecasts website.\nAdaptation.\nAdaptation involves adjusting to climate change, variability, and extremes to avoid or alleviate negative impacts and benefit from opportunities. Drought adaptations include short to long-term actions, programs, and policies implemented both during, and in advance of the drought to help reduce risks to human life, property, and productive capacity. Canadians have a great deal of experience in adapting to droughts, however, their strategies vary by sector and location. Areas with greater drought risks are often better prepared to deal with dry conditions. Drought adaptation decisions are made at a variety of levels ranging from individuals, to groups and institutions, to local and national governments. There are various adaptation processes or strategies including sharing and/or bearing the loss, modifying drought effects, research, education, behavioral changes, and avoidance. Adaptive measures include soil and water conservation, improved irrigation, the construction of infrastructure (wells, pipelines, reservoirs), and the exploration of groundwater supplies. The usefulness of these strategies varies with location, sector, and nature and timing of the drought. Better management responses may be made with improved drought monitoring and advanced prediction. Adjustments that occur after the drought are generally less effective compared to planned anticipatory adaptation.\nKey references.\nBonsal, B.R., Aider, R., Gachon, P., Lapp, S. 2013.

It is an interdisciplinary effort involving 15 funded investigators from six Canadian universities, over 20 collaborators from other universities and federal laboratories, and partners from three provincial governments (Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan). The DRI focuses on five research themes: quantification, understanding, prediction, comparisons with other droughts, and implications for society. Details may be found in Stewart et al. (2008) and on the DRI website.\nBackground.\nDrought is an anomaly of the atmospheric, surface, and sub-surface cycling of water and energy, usually initiated with large- to regional-scale atmospheric processes, and enhanced and maintained with regional-to-local atmospheric, surface hydrology, land surface and groundwater feedback in an annual cycle. Droughts are a feature of the Canadian Prairies, where large-scale atmospheric circulation is influenced by blocking from intense orography from the west and warm ocean-derived atmospheric water sources. \nThe DRI addresses a multi-year drought which began in 1999, ending its atmospheric component in 2004\u20132005 and many of its hydrological components in 2005. It was the worst drought for at least a hundred years in portions of the prairie provinces. According to Phillips (2002), for the western and central Canadian Prairies during 2001 and 2002 \"... it was the worst of times. Even in the dust bowl of the 1930s, no single year between Medicine Hat, Kindersley and Saskatoon was drier than in 2001\". The drought affected agriculture, recreation, tourism, health, hydroelectricity, and forestry in the Prairies. Gross domestic product fell about $5.8 billion, and job losses exceeded 41,000 in 2001 and 2002. It contributed to negative (or zero net) farm income for several provinces for the first time in 25 years, with agricultural production in Canada falling by an estimated $3.6 billion in 2001\u20132002. Previously-reliable water supplies, such as streams, wetlands, reservoirs, and groundwater, were stressed and often failed.\nResearch.\nThe DRI focuses on five research themes, including quantification, understanding, and better drought prediction, and is largely funded by the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences. Comparisons with other droughts and their implications for society have also been supported by Environment Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration, Saskatchewan Watershed Authority, Saskatchewan Research Council, Manitoba Water Stewardship and Manitoba Hydro.\nCharacterization.\nTo characterize the 1999\u20132005 drought, the DRI has been quantifying its atmospheric, hydrologic, and land-surface physical features on a number of spatial and temporal scales. The analysis addresses three questions:\nThe analysis has included a four-dimensional assessment of the atmosphere during the drought over a number of temporal scales using temperature, humidity, geopotential height, wind, clouds, precipitation amount, and current weather. At the surface, the spatial and temporal characteristics of a vegetative state (water stress) for major vegetation types (crops and boreal zones), soil moisture, stream networks, river flows, lake levels, wetlands, depression storage, groundwater and sub-surface flows are assessed to determine when and where drought is occurring. Analysis of in-situ data, satellite data and model outputs provide an overview of the drought's evolution.\nProcesses.\nThe DRI is also focused on understanding the processes and feedback governing the formation, evolution, cessation, and structure of the drought with the following questions:\nDrought can be initiated and prolonged in a number of ways. Processes which reduce precipitation include large-scale circulation anomalies, lack of moisture advected into a region, reduction of local moisture supplies, the production of virga (with precipitation not reaching the ground), and the possible role of aerosols in a dusty environment. During the five-year drought, these processes and other factors operated at a number of times and locations to preclude substantial precipitation over large portions of the Prairies.\nPrediction.\nResearch aims to assess and reduce uncertainties in the prediction of drought and its structure, and is focused on the evaluation and improvement of models; modelling tools used are global and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs) and hydrological models. Hydrological models are driven by output from atmospheric models, data from research sites, and reanalysis. DRI modeling studies address the following questions:\nArchived historical-model outputs and new simulations address many of these issues, and DRI research assesses the role of soil moisture and snow cover on seasonal predictions.\nComparisons.\nThe 1999\u20132005 drought has been compared with previous droughts in this region and elsewhere in the context of climate variability and change. These comparisons are guided by the following questions:\nComparisons of the 1999-2005 drought have focused on its internal structure and presence in a particular region. Many droughts (including this one) have a complex internal structure for their precipitation patterns, which often change dramatically during the drought.\nImpacts.\nProgress in drought characterization and prediction impacts society, reflected in the following questions:\nThe DRI, in consultation with its users, has introduced a DEWS (Drought Early Warning System) test and formed an advisory committee consisting of experts from user agencies and groups.\nProgram structure.\nThe DRI is led by principal investigators Ronald Stewart and John Pomeroy. A board of directors chaired by Jim Bruce oversees the program's strategy, and a science committee makes day-to-day decisions about the implementation of the project. Operational details are implemented by a secretariat consisting of a network manager, a financial manager, and two data managers. The Partners Advisory Committee, chaired by Harvey Hill, reports user needs to the board of directors. The program also collaborates with research initiatives and departments at the provincial, federal and international level.\nLegacy.\nThe DRI has assembled an unprecedented volume of information on drought in Canada, and its website links to datasets which quantify elements of drought in the atmosphere, at the surface and below the surface; a Prairie-wide database of provincial groundwater and water levels is part of this effort.

A drought can last for days, months or years. Drought often has large impacts on the ecosystems and agriculture of affected regions, and causes harm to the local economy. Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent wildfires. Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.\nDrought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world, becoming more extreme and less predictable due to climate change, which dendrochronological studies date back to 1900. There are three kinds of drought effects, environmental, economic and social. Environmental effects include the drying of wetlands, more and larger wildfires, loss of biodiversity. Economic consequences include disruption of water supplies for municipal economies; lower agricultural, forest, game, and fishing outputs; higher food-production costs; and problems with water supply for the energy sector. Social and health costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves), high food costs, stress caused by failed harvests, water scarcity, etc. Prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crisis. \nMany plant species, such as those in the family Cactaceae (or cacti), have drought tolerance adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought. Some others survive dry periods as buried seeds. Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands. Most arid ecosystems have inherently low productivity. \nThe most prolonged drought ever in the world in recorded history continues in the Atacama Desert in Chile (400 years). Throughout history, humans have usually viewed droughts as \"disasters\" due to the impact on food availability and the rest of society. Humans have often tried to explain droughts as either a natural disaster, caused by humans, or the result of supernatural forces. \nDefinition.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines a drought simply as \"drier than normal conditions\". This means that a drought is \"a moisture deficit relative to the average water availability at a given location and season\". \nAccording to National Integrated Drought Information System, a multi-agency partnership, drought is generally defined as \u201ca deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time (usually a season or more), resulting in a water shortage\u201d. The National Weather Service office of the NOAA defines drought as \"a deficiency of moisture that results in adverse impacts on people, animals, or vegetation over a sizeable area\".\nDrought is a complex phenomenon \u2212 relating to the absence of water \u2212 which is difficult to monitor and define. By the early 1980's, over 150 definitions of \"drought\" had already been published. The range of definitions reflects differences in regions, needs, and disciplinary approaches. \nCategories.\nThere are three major categories of drought based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and agricultural or ecological drought. A meteorological drought occurs due to lack of precipitation. A hydrological drought is related to low runoff, streamflow, and reservoir storage. An agricultural or ecological drought is causing plant stress from a combination of evaporation and low soil moisture. Some organizations add another category: socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply as a result of a weather-related shortfall in water supply. The socioeconomic drought is a similar concept to water scarcity. \nThe different categories of droughts have different causes but similar effects:\nCauses.\nGeneral precipitation deficiency.\nMechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall. Convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation, while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer duration. Precipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice. Droughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are, in themselves, low. If these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficiently to reach the surface over a sufficient time, the result is a drought. Drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems, winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses, and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Once a region is within drought, feedback mechanisms such as local arid air, hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging, and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions.\nDry season.\nWithin the tropics, distinct, wet and dry seasons emerge due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone or Monsoon trough. The dry season greatly increases drought occurrence, and is characterized by its low humidity, with watering holes and rivers drying up. Because of the lack of these watering holes, many grazing animals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water in search of more fertile lands. Examples of such animals are zebras, elephants, and wildebeest. Because of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are common. Since water vapor becomes more energetic with increasing temperature, more water vapor is required to increase relative humidity values to 100% at higher temperatures (or to get the temperature to fall to the dew point). Periods of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable production, increase evaporation and transpiration from plants, and worsen drought conditions.\nEl Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon can sometimes play a significant role in drought. ENSO comprises two patterns of temperature anomalies in the central Pacific Ocean, known as La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. La Ni\u00f1a events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of drought in California and the Southwestern United States, and to some extent the U.S. Southeast. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Ni\u00f1as have become more frequent over time. \nConversely, during El Ni\u00f1o events, drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America. Winters during the El Ni\u00f1o are warmer and drier than average conditions in the Northwest, northern Midwest, and northern Mideast United States, so those regions experience reduced snowfalls. Conditions are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana. Direct effects of El Ni\u00f1o resulting in drier conditions occur in parts of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, increasing bush fires, worsening haze, and decreasing air quality dramatically. Drier-than-normal conditions are also in general observed in Queensland, inland Victoria, inland New South Wales, and eastern Tasmania from June to August. As warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, it causes extensive drought in the western Pacific. Singapore experienced the driest February in 2014 since records began in 1869, with only 6.3\u00a0mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35\u00a0\u00b0C on 26 February. The years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4\u00a0mm of rain fell.\nPrecipitation deficiency due to climate change.\nGlobal climate change is expected to trigger droughts with a substantial impact on agriculture throughout the world, and especially in developing nations. Along with drought in some areas, flooding and erosion could increase in others. Some proposed climate change mitigation actions that focus on more active techniques, solar radiation management through the use of a space sunshade for one, may also carry with them increased chances of drought.\nThere is a rise of compound warm-season droughts in Europe that are concurrent with an increase in potential evapotranspiration.\nErosion and human activities.\nHuman activity can directly trigger exacerbating factors such as over farming, excessive irrigation, deforestation, and erosion adversely impact the ability of the land to capture and hold water. In arid climates, the main source of erosion is wind. Erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. The wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region (deflation). Suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.\nLoess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess. Wind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the Great Plains, it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.\nConsequences.\nOne can divide the effects of droughts and water shortages into three groups: environmental, economic and social (including health).\nEffects vary according to vulnerability. For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food-sources. Areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food-source are more vulnerable to famine.\nEnvironmental and economic consequences.\nCommon environmental and economic consequences of drought include:\nImpacts on crops.\nWater stress affects plant development and quality in a variety of ways: firstly drought can cause poor germination and impaired seedling development. At the same time plant growth relies on cellular division, cell enlargement, and differentiation. Drought stress impairs mitosis and cell elongation via loss of turgor pressure which results in poor growth. Development of leaves is also dependent upon turgor pressure, concentration of nutrients, and carbon assimilates all of which are reduced by drought conditions, thus drought stress lead to a decrease in leaf size and number. Plant height, biomass, leaf size and stem girth has been shown to decrease in maize under water limiting conditions. Crop yield is also negatively effected by drought stress, the reduction in crop yield results from a decrease in photosynthetic rate, changes in leaf development, and altered allocation of resources all due to drought stress. Crop plants exposed to drought stress suffer from reductions in leaf water potential and transpiration rate. Water-use efficiency increases in crops such as wheat while decreasing in others, such as potatoes. \nPlants need water for the uptake of nutrients from the soil, and for the transport of nutrients throughout the plant: drought conditions limit these functions leading to stunted growth. Drought stress also causes a decrease in photosynthetic activity in plants due to the reduction of photosynthetic tissues, stomatal closure, and reduced performance of photosynthetic machinery. This reduction in photosynthetic activity contributes to the reduction in plant growth and yields. Another factor influencing reduced plant growth and yields include the allocation of resources; following drought stress plants will allocate more resources to roots to aid in water uptake increasing root growth and reducing the growth of other plant parts while decreasing yields.\nProtection, mitigation and relief.\nAgriculturally, people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation. Failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era, exacerbated by ever-increasing population densities. President Roosevelt on April 27, 1935, signed documents creating the Soil Conservation Service (SCS)\u2014now the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Models of the law were sent to each state where they were enacted. These were the first enduring practical programs to curtail future susceptibility to drought, creating agencies that first began to stress soil conservation measures to protect farm lands today. It was not until the 1950s that there was an importance placed on water conservation was put into the existing laws (NRCS 2014).\nStrategies for drought protection, mitigation or relief include:\nScale and examples.\nSome large scale droughts in the 21st century included:\nThe Darfur conflict in Sudan, also affecting Chad, was fueled by decades of drought; combination of drought, desertification and overpopulation are among the causes of the Darfur conflict, because the Arab Baggara nomads searching for water have to take their livestock further south, to land mainly occupied by non-Arab farming people.\nApproximately 2.4\u00a0billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers. India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades. Drought in India affecting the Ganges is of particular concern, as it provides drinking water and agricultural irrigation for more than 500\u00a0million people. The west coast of North America, which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, also would be affected.\nIn 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years. A 23 July 2006 article reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the rainforest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate. According to the WWF, the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.\nBy far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia. In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October 2008. Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008. Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, predicted that unless it made drastic changes, Perth in Western Australia could become the world's first ghost metropolis, an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population. The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010.\nRecurring droughts leading to desertification in East Africa have created grave ecological catastrophes, prompting food shortages in 1984\u201385, 2006 and 2011. During the 2011 drought, an estimated 50,000 to 150,000 people were reported to have died, though these figures and the extent of the crisis are disputed. In February 2012, the UN announced that the crisis was over due to a scaling up of relief efforts and a bumper harvest. Aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery efforts, including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds. The 2020-2022 Horn of Africa drought has surpassed the horrific drought in 2010-2011 in both duration and severity.\nIn 2012, a severe drought struck the western Sahel. The Methodist Relief &amp; Development Fund (MRDF) reported that more than 10 million people in the region were at risk of famine due to a month-long heat wave that was hovering over Niger, Mali, Mauritania and Burkina Faso. A fund of about \u00a320,000 was distributed to the drought-hit countries. \nHistory.\nThroughout history, humans have usually viewed droughts as \"disasters\" due to the impact on food availability and the rest of society. Humans have often tried to explain droughts as either a natural disaster, caused by humans, or the result of supernatural forces. It is among the earliest documented climatic events, present in the Epic of Gilgamesh and tied to the Biblical story of Joseph's arrival in and the later Exodus from ancient Egypt. Hunter-gatherer migrations in 9,500 BC Chile have been linked to the phenomenon, as has the exodus of early humans out of Africa and into the rest of the world around 135,000 years ago. Rituals exist to prevent or avert drought, rainmaking could go from dances to scapegoating to human sacrifices. Nowadays, those ancient practices are for the most part relegated to folklore and replaced by more rational water management.\nHistorical droughts include:", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

This concept has evolved during the last decade as researchers have become more interested in understanding and mitigating its impacts. Flash droughts differ from other drought categories such as meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, ecological, and socioeconomic droughts, in that they develop and intensify more quickly, posing unique challenges for monitoring, prediction, and mitigation.\nHistory.\nFlash droughts have gained increasing attention from researchers and policymakers due to their significant impacts on agriculture and water resources. The term \"flash drought\" was coined to describe the rapid onset and intensification of drought conditions, which set it apart from other, more conventional drought types that develop over longer periods. Early research focused on understanding the unique characteristics and drivers of flash droughts, while more recent studies have explored their impacts on agriculture, ecosystems, and water resources.\nRemote Sensing.\nRemote sensing data, such as satellite-derived measurements of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and vegetation indices, can provide valuable information on the development and progression of flash droughts. Remote sensing data can be used to assess the rapid response of ecosystems to flash droughts by analysing multiple ecological metrics derived from satellite observations. These metrics, such as gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI), can provide insights into the reactions of ecosystems to flash droughts from both vegetation physiological and structural perspectives.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}
{"id": "72423414", "revid": "44684356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72423414", "title": "Drought tolerance in barley", "text": "Barley (\"Hordeum vulgare\") is known to be more environmentally-tolerant than other cereal crops, in terms of soil pH, mineral nutrient availability, and water availability. Because of this, much research is being done on barley plants in order to determine whether or not there is a genetic basis for this environmental hardiness.\nEffect of drought on barley plants.\nBarley is a C4 species and a monocot, and therefore the effects drought has on it can be extrapolated to other plant species. Drought is often the result of increased temperature in a region, which promotes water loss in plants by increased transpirational pull. Lack of water in the soil decreases mineral nutrient availability, as minerals must be dissolved in soil solution in order to enter the roots. Additionally, drought results in decreased photosynthetic rates, decreased biomass, and accelerated leaf senescence.\nSignificance.\nBarley has been an invaluable crop for humans since the birth of the Fertile Crescent. Prior to the mass cultivation of maize (\"Zea mays\"), wheat (\"Triticum aestivum\") and rice (\"Oryza sativa\"), barley was the main cereal crop for humans. Today, barley is primarily used for animal feed (55-60%) and malt (30-40%). Many developing countries still rely heavily on barley as a food source, especially in regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and South America. A decline in barley production would therefore greatly contribute to the already ongoing food crises in these countries. CO2 levels have increased by 48% since the Industrial Revolution (1760-2019), thus clouding Earth's atmosphere and resulting in rising global temperatures. This has resulted in an increase in extreme weather events, such as drought, in many regions of the world which contain valuable farming land. Overall, climates are erratically changing, and one foreseeable way to combat global food insecurity is to breed crops which are tolerant to environmental stresses.\nMechanisms.\nC4 photosynthesis.\nBarley plants photosynthesize via the C4 pathway, meaning they fix CO2 into a 4-carbon organic acid, which is then shuttled to the bundle sheath, preventing diffusion back into the atmosphere. The C4 pathway uses PEP-carboxylase as a catalyst for carbon fixation, rather than RuBisCO, which is used in the C3 pathway. PEP-carboxylase has a higher affinity for CO2, and does not have affinity for O2, which prevents photorespiration. Overall, the C4 pathway allows barley plants to fix carbon more efficiently, thus allowing them to keep their stomata open for less time, preventing water loss by transpiration.\nAbscisic acid.\nAbscisic acid (ABA) is the hormone which plants release in response to stress. It induces stomatal closure in plants, decreasing water loss by transpiration. However, increased stomatal closure results in decreased CO2 assimilation. Perhaps to combat this in the short-term, ABA synthesis also promotes elongation of root cells, which in turn promotes mineral nutrient uptake. Other research has also shown that ABA increases carbonic anhydrase activity under drought conditions.\nIncreased root growth.\nCertain varieties of barley plants produce larger root systems. A larger root system improves tolerance to drought by not only increasing the surface area for mineral nutrient absorption, but also by improving the ability of plants to reach deep ground water.\nIncreased antioxidant production.\nBarley plants grown under drought stress exhibit higher activity of antioxidant enzymes, which prevent oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species. Plants are at increased risk of cellular damage when exposed to drought stress due to increased production of reactive oxygen species, and therefore this increased antioxidant activity likely aids in protecting the plant under drought stress.\nReduced stomatal density.\nStudies have shown that reduced stomatal density in barley plants does not decrease grain yield despite decreasing gas exchange. A decrease in number of stomata improves drought tolerance by simply inhibiting water escape, thus enhancing water-use efficiency.\nDecreased nitric oxide levels.\nBarley plants grown under drought stress also exhibit decreased levels of nitric oxide, which studies have shown increased polyamine production. Polyamines aid in plant wellbeing during drought stress by stabilizing cellular structures, such as DNA and membranes, thus prolonging survival.\nGenetic basis.\nRecent research has shown that barley is highly variable in its genotypes concerning drought tolerance, in both wild and cultivated varieties. Indeed, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been associated with barley seed germination in drought conditions. As well, varieties grown in more arid climates exhibit better regulation of reactive oxygen species than varieties grown in cooler climates. Traits which would be favourable and unfavourable in drought conditions have been found to exist in barley plants, suggesting that the agricultural industry could plausibly select for drought-resistant traits in barley plants to grow in warmer regions, and the opposite for cooler regions in order to maximize yield.\nIdentifying the genes responsible for drought tolerance in barley plants and applying them to other plant species or other barley varieties via transgenics has also shown promising results. One study expressed the \"hva1\" gene from barley in creeping bentgrass, and found that it improved drought tolerance by lessening the effects of water-deficit damage. Similarly, transgenic Basmati rice plants containing an \"hva1\" gene from barley exhibited higher drought tolerance than control plants. Other research finds that expression of the \"HvMYB1\" gene in barley is increased under drought stress, and when over-expressed in transgenic barley plants, was found to increase drought tolerance. Induced over-expression of K+ transporters in barley plants has also been found to increase drought tolerance, due to the many roles K+ plays in plant metabolism and physiology, such as stomatal aperture.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

These predominantly pastoral regions reported deaths of up to half of the livestock. Droughts in Kenya have become more frequent causing crop failures and devastation as three-quarters of the population are sustained by agriculture.\nBackground.\nOwing to the lack of annual rainfall, the arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya (ASALs) are very susceptible to drought and flooding. These lands are impacted by the increasing effects of climate change and the risk of desertification. Water scarcity leaves unimproved water supplies for the majority of the population, so these places tend to be marginalized, and have high rates of poverty.\nKenya experienced limited rainfall in 2008 from October to December, followed by a similar situation in 2009. The Kenyan Red Cross conducted assessment reports indicating the risk of starvation for millions of Kenyans, resulting in an appeal to the international donor community for food aid.\nKenya has been supported by a drought management system since 1980. The system includes policies and strategies, an early warning system, a funded contingency plan, and overall drought coordination and response structure.

The system became the responsibility of the National Drought Management Authority, established in 2011.\nEffects.\nFood security.\nAgriculture supports around 75% of the Kenyan population and accounts for 25.9% of the GDP, making it one of the leading means of sustenance of the country and a significant contributor to employment and food security; on the other hand, droughts caused by climate change have put a strain on agriculture and the country itself to the extent that in January 2009 the Government declared a state of emergency, because ten million Kenyans needed food aid after a poor harvest.\nIn the North of the country, by April, 30% of the population was suffering from acute malnutrition because the \"long rains\" of 2009 failed, and some areas of the country were already worn out by five years of consecutive droughts.\nThe shortage of food was also worsened by a political crisis caused by a disputed election in early 2008. This provoked a climate of violence in the East of the country which drove away farmers who were unable to return in time to plant maize in the planting season. This led to food, water, and power shortages throughout the country.\nIn 2011 the USAID youth program, which works closely with Feed the Future, brought groups of young mothers together to improve food security, working on nutrition. Cultivating vegetables and legumes they have been improving their health and that of their infants, in a shared urban farm in Mombasa. Making sure that children are well-fed is eminent as malnutrition in childhood and pregnancy has many adverse consequences for child survival and long-term well-being. Food-borne illnesses are often caused by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens that affect human health. Food security issues were also created by violations in trade standards, resulting in the exclusion of food from international, regional, and local markets.\nEffects on the Maasai pastoralists.\nIn Kenya, pastoralism represents a mainstay source of sustenance, providing livelihood, security, and employment opportunities (around 90% of the population). It is impacted by droughts, that directly impact livestock assets of pastoral households.\nMaasai pastoralists are traditionally semi-nomad and practice seasonal transhumance from dry to wet season pastures. The severe drought of 2009 has prompted pastoralists in Northern Kenya to abandon their traditional lifestyles (like in the 2005 drought) due to the harsh living conditions and the destruction of their pastures by drought, overgrazing, and soil erosion. In conditions of extreme drought, some pastoralists tried to dig down into dry riverbeds and water pans looking for water and others moved onto highland pastures in Mt. Kenya. These responses were eventually unsuccessful due to the increasing number of livestock deaths (it is estimated that over 38,000 cattle died). The high number of losses also constituted a social implication for the Maasai, who as a tradition measure their wealth on the dimension of their herds.\nDue to the high mortality rate at the time, there was a major decline in livestock. This raised the prices of milk and other livestock items, which adversely affected hunger levels and lowered income levels. Land degradation also increased due to livestock competition from pastures and water.\nTo cope with the drought in the short term the Maasai developed four strategies. The first was to take their animals to graze very early in the morning when the grass is covered with dew. The second was to guard reserve pastures on their higher lands while the grass regenerated so that it can be used during drought. The third strategy was to increase the length of their migrations as the gravity of the drought worsened. The last method was to dig shallow wells in dry riverbeds during migrations to acquire water.\nTwo long-term solutions were developed. The first was to keep livestock of mixed-species; in addition to the traditional herd composed by grazers (cattle and sheep) and browsers (goats), pastoralists added donkeys and camels. Different animal species adapt differently to drought and this method ensured that at least part of the herd survived in a specific climatic event. The second method was to increase the size of their herds during wetter periods, so they have some animals left at the end of a drought period.\nMicro-climate.\nClimate change has been playing an important role in Kenya's droughts, reducing the drought cycle from every ten years to annual events. When the cycle of droughts in Kenya occurred every ten years, farmers had recovery time to rebuild their livestock and crops before the next drought. When the recovery time dropped to two years, this recovery was no longer possible.\nDryness is not the only outcome of climate change: rains have decreased during the long rainy season (from March to May), but have registered an increase from September to February causing an extension of the normal rainfall period (October to December), which, together with growing intensity and strength, has created vulnerability to floods.\nThe table below displays data of the average monthly rainfall of Kenya from 1901 to 2016, compared with the predicted changes for 2080\u20132099.\nIt is expected that the annual average temperature of the territory of Kenya will increase by 1.0\u00a0\u00b0C to 2.8\u00a0\u00b0C by 2060, with greater effects in the tea production, but a negative impact on crop and maize revenues.\nData showing the actual and predicted mean annual temperature increase is shown for the period 1901 to 2099: \nThe Rift Valley Province is particularly sensitive to climate change. It is predicted that coastal areas will suffer from rising sea levels from which floods and saltwater intrusions will result, due to the melting of glaciers which will further reduce the availability of water.\nThe effects on wildlife.\nDue to the drought animals were dying, some from starvation, others of thirst and many because their weak immune systems could not fight disease or infection.\nBy September 2009, at least 60 elephants and hundreds of animals had died in the country.\nThere was a conflict between locals and wildlife due to the absence of land. Consequently, the pastoralists took their herds illegally into the national parks and wildlife reserves, in a search for grazing land and water. The pastoralists felt betrayed by their government because they thought that the interests of the tourists who come to see the wildlife had been put before their own. They questioned why they had to allow wildlife on to their land but could not legally use the parks and reserves for grazing at such difficult times.\nThe effects on the GDP.\nBefore the 2008 drought, the Kenyan economy had been growing at relatively high annual rates ranging from 6 to 7 per cent, and it was expected to continue on the same path during the following years. The annual growth rate fell to 1.5 per cent because of the drought. Despite the growth they worked for in the construction sector, tourism and agriculture faced very high declines (-36 and -5 per cent, respectively), and inflation rose to an unprecedented annual rate of 26.2 per cent.\nIn 2009, the government designed certain steps to promote growth in order to increase the GDP. These initiatives included restoration of investor confidence, an expansionary fiscal policy through a stimulus package, and monetary policy focus to preserve price stability at a single-digit rate. They were able to make the GDP rise by 2.6% with this method. The agriculture sector contracted by 2.7% due to the drought, high costs of inputs, and depressed demand for some of the country's exports due to the global financial crisis.\nIn 2011, the GDP reached 10.06% due to the strong performance of the financial sector, construction and tourism. The population was also facing a high annual rate of inflation caused by rising food and fuel prices, which appeared to affect the poor disproportionately. The combination of four factors was also threatening the Kenyan economy: high fuel prices, high food prices, the drought in the Horn of Africa, and the Euro crisis.\nResponses.\nThe main financial contributors in efforts were ALRMP (Arid Lands Resource Management Project) and the government; these organizations are designated a significant role under the country's drought management system.\nALRMP funded 83% of interventions and provided for 46% of total expenditure on drought response; 62% of the total transactions audited during 2007\u20132008 were suspected to be fraudulent or questionable. Among the funds, foreign donors accounted for 8%. This is likely to be an underestimation because cost information for two-thirds of the projects funded by these donors were not available. Government accounted for 29% of spending, but just 6% of programs, reflecting the high cost of the commercial interventions for de-stocking.\nWater related responses.\nMost water tankering interventions were not providing adequate supplementary water to justify the cost involved. The amount of that water in the communities was relatively limited, not even coming close to the MoWI\u2019s suggested standard of per person per day.\nIn Dol Dol, the people were able to remain in the villages even though starvation had not been completely eradicated. Clean water tanks were distributed to the communities, who used it to cook their food, removing the need to walk to fetch water (6:00 to 15:00 every day). The farm animals had access to water, but the impact was minimal as most died anyway.\nThere were two limits of the intervention. Firstly, the water supplied was not enough for all the inhabitants. Only those who lived near the roads could be helped, because the arid terrain made moving to the inner villages too risky. Secondly, whoever managed to acquire the water could only use it for cooking and drinking, because there was not enough to be used for chores such as washing clothes or bathing. They mostly targeted women and schools for water support, rather than the adult male population, therefore the community estimated only about 10 per cent of the population benefited. In Merti, Isiolo, the community also felt that the use of a Bowser (tanker) helped the people that were left in the villages, whilst the animal breeders were forced to migrate with their animals, looking for other natural sources.\nCommercial destocking responses.\nBy the height of the drought in mid-2008, few measures had been implemented. Most of the effective measures occurred in 2009. Compared to other measures, de-stocking, restocking and animal health interventions began relatively late. All de-stocking options were carried out after June 2009, when the drought had reached its worst stage. After June, 63% of all measures were introduced, 77% related to animal feeding, 70% to borehole development/maintenance, and 54% for peace-building.\nThe Kenyan government began carry out de-stocking operations in May 2009. Effective contributions made from NGOs started later in the year, from July 2009. ALRMP, which began to contribute to interventions by the Kenyan government, was the only exception to this latency of action by the key members. \n49% of the total expenditure on livestock-related drought intervention between 2008 and 2009 was accounted for by conventional livestock interventions, which mainly included feed, health, and de-stocking. The Kenyan government and ALRMP were the biggest investors, highlighting the contributions made by organizations in the Kenyan drought management system. \nLivestock responses.\nIn Kenya, recurrent droughts can contribute to livestock disease. Consequently, more animal breeders chose to train in the field of livestock health. The increase in the number of trained and community-based health workers operating in the Turkana areas has enabled livestock keepers to acquire relevant skills through training and knowledge.\nA tradition of the Kenyan rural culture is that local herbs and techniques are used in the treatment of livestock diseases. In recent years, with the emergence of trained community-based animal health workers, a safer and more advanced control is being opted for.\nResponses assessment.\nThe effectiveness of the drought intervention measures have been assessed in a range of studies. The main determinants which established the level of effectiveness of an intervention were whether the intervention was completed as planned and if they were able to deliver the intended benefits to the targeted beneficiaries.\nContributions from NGOs were generally considered more effective than those completed by the Kenyan government. Specifically, the contributions that made most of the difference and therefore top-ranked in the highest average effectiveness ratings, were funded by international donors.\nIt was not possible to determine a relationship between the effectiveness of an intervention and the time at which it started.\nOn average, an intervention reached 3,227 individuals, increasing from 55 for peace-building to 22,370 for water trucking. The cost per individual reached was KSh.\u00a0 (approximately US$30.60 in 2021). This ranged from for water trucking to for emergency replenishment. This indicates that a total of more than 1.5 million people benefited, based on the presumption of no duplication (if the same person is benefiting from multiple interventions).\nThe real relative impact that each intervention has had on the population is difficult to assess even though there is evidence to determine a better efficacy of one intervention. The reason is that there is inadequate information on the scale of the benefits given to individuals and households.\nIn general, there was no relationship between an intervention's efficacy and the capital invested in its success.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Below normal precipitation leads to drought, and is caused by an above average persistence of high pressure over the affected area. Changes in the track of extratropical cyclones, which can occur during climate cycles such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, modulate which areas are more prone to drought. Increased drought frequency and severity is also expected to be one of the effects of global warming.\nDrought having an acute economic impact in the history of the United States occurred during the 1930s and 1940s, periods of time known as 'Dust Bowl' years where relief and health agencies became overburdened and many local community banks had to close. The event also led to significant changes in farming practices emphasizing soil conservation and water resource management, inspired further growth in U.S. water storage and delivery infrastructure as part of the New Deal, and influenced other social changes.\nFurthermore, global La Ni\u00f1a meteorological events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of droughts in California and the Southwestern and to some extent Southeastern United States. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Ni\u00f1as have become more frequent over time.\nMetrics.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor provides a national database to track the duration and severity of droughts in the United States. It is hosted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with assistance from the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Their standardized measurements track droughts on a severity scale from \"Abnormally Dry\" (D0) to \"Exceptional\" (D4).\nCauses.\nMechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall. Convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation, while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer duration. Precipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice.\nIf these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficient to reach the surface over a sufficient period of time, the result is a drought. Drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems, winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses, and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Once a region is within drought, feedback mechanisms such as local arid air, hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging, and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions. Winters during El Ni\u00f1o are warmer and drier than average in the Northwest, northern Midwest, and northern Mideast United States, so those regions experience reduced snowfalls.\nActivities resulting in global climate change are expected to trigger droughts with a substantial impact on agriculture and increased social unrest throughout the world, especially in developing nations. Overall, global warming will result in increased world rainfall. Along with drought in some areas, flooding and erosion will increase in others. Paradoxically, some proposed solutions to global warming that focus on more active techniques, solar radiation management through the use of a space sunshade for one, may also carry with them increased chances of drought.\nRegional response.\nCertain regions within the United States are more susceptible to droughts than others. Droughts can be more damaging than tornadoes, tropical cyclones, winter storms and flooding combined. Unlike a hurricane, tornado or flooding, the onset of droughts happen gradually over a long period of time.\nIn dry areas, removing grass cover and going with a more natural vegetation for the area can reduce the impact of drought, since a significant amount of fresh water is used to keep lawns green. In the Nevada \"cash for grass\" program, the people are paid to remove grass and put in desert landscaping, which calls for the planting of vegetation which is local in origin and more resistant to drought.\nWhen California suffered a severe drought from 1985 to 1991, a California company, Sun Belt Water Inc. was established for the purpose importing water from Canada in marine transport vessels formerly used for oil transport and converted to water carriers. The idea was commercially viable and Sun Belt Water Inc., was selected by the Goleta Water District to enter a long-term contract. When the government of British Columbia reversed its existing bulk water export policy, the change in government policy led to a claim by Sun Belt Water Inc. against Canada under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nThe National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Act was signed into law in 2006 (Public Law ). The Western Governors' Association described the need for NIDIS in a 2004 report, \"Creating a Drought Early Warning System for the 21st Century: The National Integrated Drought Information System\". The NIDIS Act calls for an interagency, multi-partner approach to drought monitoring, forecasting, and early warning, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NIDIS is being developed to consolidate data on drought's physical, hydrological and socio-economic impacts on an ongoing basis, to develop drought decision support and simulation tools for critical, drought-sensitive areas, and to enable proactive planning by those affected by drought. NIDIS (www.drought.gov) draws on the personnel, experience, and networks of the National Drought Mitigation Center, the NOAA Regional Climate Centers, and the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISAs), among others. Federal agencies and departments partnering in NIDIS include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Geological Survey, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\nEvents.\nPre-1800.\nThe earliest and longest drought discussed in the literature is the \"Altithermal Long Drought\", which some scholars now believe was in reality two severe shorter droughts (ca. 7000-6500 BP and 6000-5500 BP), separated by an interval. Other early notable droughts in North America include the Fairbank Drought of 500 BC and the Whitewater Drought of 330\u00a0C.E.\nThere were megadroughts in what is now the central and western United States, between 900 and 1300.\nA megadrought struck what is now the American Southwest 1276\u20131299\u00a0C.E., which severely affected the Pueblo cities, and tree rings also document drought in the lower and central Mississippi River basin between the 14th and 16th century. The droughts of that period may have contributed to the decline and fall of the Mississippian cultures. Data from tree rings indicate that the megadroughts which occurred throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, exceeded anything which occurred within the twentieth century in both spatial extent and duration, including the Dust Bowl of the 1930s and drought in the 1950s, but was co-equal to the drought there in the early 21st century.\nThe 18th century seems to have been a relatively wet century in North America, but there were apparently droughts in Iowa in 1721, 1736, and from 1771 to 1773.\n19th Century.\nThere were at least three major droughts in 19th-century North America: one from the mid-1850s to the mid-1860s, one in the 1870s, and one in the 1890s. There was also a drought around 1820; the periods from 1816 to 1844 and from 1849 to 1880 were rather dry, and the 19th century overall was a dry century for the Great Plains. While there was little rain-gauge data from the mid-19th century in the middle of the US, there were plenty of trees, and tree-ring data showed evidence of a major drought from around 1856 to around 1865. Native Americans were hard hit, as the bison they depended upon on the Plains moved to river valleys in search of water, and those valleys were full of natives and settlers alike. The river valleys were also home to domestic livestock, which competed against the bison for food. The result was starvation for many of the bison.\nThe 1870\u20131877 drought brought with it a major swarm of Rocky Mountain Locusts, as droughts benefit locusts, making plants more nutritious and edible to locusts and reducing diseases that harm locusts. Locusts also grow more quickly during a drought and gather in small spots of lush vegetation, enabling them to swarm, facts which contributed to the ruin of much of the farmland in the American West. The evidence for this drought is also primarily in tree-ring, rather than rain gauge, data.\nThe 1890s drought, between 1890 and 1896, was the first to be widely and adequately recorded by rain gauges, with much of the American West having been settled. Railroads promised land to people willing to settle it, and the period between 1877 and 1890 was wetter than usual, leading to unrealistic expectations of land productivity. The amount of land required to support a family in more arid regions was already larger than the amount that could realistically be irrigated by a family, but this fact was made more obvious by the drought, leading to emigration from recently settled lands. The Federal government started to assist with irrigation with the 1902 Reclamation Act.\n1930s.\nThe Dust Bowl or the Dirty Thirties was a period of severe dust storms causing major ecological and agricultural damage to American and Canadian prairie lands from 1930 to 1936 (in some areas until 1940). The phenomenon was caused by severe drought coupled with decades of extensive farming without crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops or other techniques to prevent erosion. Deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains had displaced the natural grasses that normally kept the soil in place and trapped moisture even during periods of drought and high winds.\nDuring the drought of the 1930s, without natural anchors to keep the soil in place, it dried, turned to dust, and blew away eastward and southward in large dark clouds. At times the clouds blackened the sky reaching all the way to East Coast cities such as New York and Washington, D.C. Much of the soil ended up deposited in the Atlantic Ocean, carried by prevailing winds which were in part created by the dry and bare soil conditions itself. These immense dust storms\u2014given names such as \"Black Blizzards\" and \"Black Rollers\"\u2014often reduced visibility to a few feet (around a meter). The Dust Bowl affected , centered on the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma, and adjacent parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas.\nMillions of acres of farmland became useless, and hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave their homes; many of these families (often known as \"Okies\", since so many of them came from Oklahoma) traveled to California and other states, where they found economic conditions little better than those they had left. Owning no land, many traveled from farm to farm picking fruit and other crops at starvation wages. Author John Steinbeck later wrote \"The Grapes of Wrath\", which won the Pulitzer Prize, and \"Of Mice and Men\" about such people.\nNegative effects included bank closures and overburdened relief and health agencies. Economic migrants also had mixed success as native workers in many areas resented the intense competition for dwindling jobs. The National Drought Mitigation Center has reported that financial assistance from the government alone may have been as high as $1 billion (in 1930s dollars) by the end of the drought.\n1940s.\nDrought began in the Southwestern United States in 1944 and continued through the entire rest of the decade; one of the longest recorded droughts observed there. This drought continued into the 1950s.\n1950s.\nOther severe drought years in the United States happened through the 1950s. These droughts continued from the 1940s drought in the Southwestern United States, New Mexico and Texas during 1950 and 1951; the drought was widespread through the Central Plains, Midwest and certain Rocky Mountain States, particularly between the years 1953 and 1957, and by 1956 parts of central Nebraska reached a drought index of \u22127, three points below the extreme drought index. From 1950 to 1957, Texas experienced the most severe drought in recorded history. By the time the drought ended, 244 of Texas's 254 counties had been declared federal disaster areas. Drought became particularly severe in California, with some natural lakes drying up completely in 1953. Southern California was hit hard by drought in 1958\u20131959, badly straining water resources. A widespread, 1930s-style dust storm affected the Plains and beyond on 19 February 1954 driven by winds of up to 100\u00a0mph/161\u00a0km/h, drifting soil to 3 feet/a metre deep in some areas.\n1960s.\nThe Northeastern United States were hit with devastating drought which lasted almost four to five years in the 1960s, peaking in 1965. The drought affected multiple regional cities from Virginia into Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut; the drought also affected certain Midwest States, including Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and the Great Plains. Drought continued in parts of California in the early 1960s. Southern California recorded its worst drought of the 20th century in 1961.\n1970s.\nShort term droughts hit particular spots of the United States during 1976 and 1977. California's statewide snowpack reached an all-time low in 1977. Water resources and agriculture (especially livestock) suffered; negatively impacting the nation's economy. This drought reversed itself completely the following year.\n1980s.\nDroughts also affected the Northeast US, Corn Belt and Midwest States during 1980 and 1983. The 1983 Midwestern States Drought was associated with very dry conditions, severe heat and substandard crop growth which affected prices and caused hardship for farmers. Multiple disaster declarations went out in Indiana and neighboring states because of the 1983 drought. Readings of or higher became prevalent in 1983 during these dry spells across the Midwest, Ohio Valley Regions and Great Lakes. Kentucky declared the 1983 drought their second-worst in the 20th century; 1983 was Ohio's driest calendar year. Los Angeles received more rainfall than Cleveland that year. The drought forced many trees and shrubs into dormancy and created water shortages in many towns. The associating heat waves killed between 500 and 700\u00a0people in the United States. Similar spells during 1980 caused between 4000 and 12000 deaths in the United States along with $24\u00a0billion in damage 1980\u00a0USD.\nA severe drought struck the Southeast from 1985 through 1987. It began in 1985 from the Carolinas west-southwest into Alabama, when annual rainfall was reduced by 5 to 35\u00a0percent below what was normal. Light precipitation continued into the spring of 1986, with Atlanta, Georgia recording their driest first six months on record. High amounts of precipitation during the winter of 1987 ended the drought.\nThe Western United States experienced a lengthy drought in the late 1980s. California went through one of its longest observed droughts, from late 1986 through early 1991. Drought worsened in 1988\u20131989, as much of the United States also suffered from severe drought. In California, the five-year drought ended in late 1991 as a result of unusual persistent heavy rains, most likely caused by a significant El Ni\u00f1o event in the Pacific Ocean and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991.\nAnother significant drought in the United States occurred during 1988 and 1989. Following a milder drought in the Southeastern United States the year before, this drought spread from the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains and Western United States. This drought was widespread, unusually intense and accompanied by heat waves which killed around 4,800 to 17,000\u00a0people across the United States and also killed livestock across the United States. One particular reason that the drought of 1988 became very damaging was farmers might have farmed on land which was marginally arable. Another reason was pumping groundwater near the depletion mark. The drought of 1988 destroyed crops almost nationwide, residents' lawns went brown and water restrictions were declared in many cities. The Yellowstone National Park fell victim to wildfires that burned many trees and created exceptional destruction in the area. This drought was very catastrophic for multiple reasons; it continued across the Upper Midwest States and North Plains States during 1989, not officially ending until 1990.\nThe conditions continued into 1989 and 1990, although the drought had ended in some states thanks to normal rainfalls returning to some portions of the United States. Dry conditions, however, increased again during 1989, affecting Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, much of Nebraska,\nKansas, Minnesota and some regions of Colorado. The drought also affected Canada in certain divisions. The drought of 1988 became the worst drought since the Dust Bowl 50 years before in the United States; 2008 estimates put damages from the drought somewhere between $80\u00a0billion and almost $120\u00a0billion in damage (2008\u00a0USD). The drought of 1988 was so devastating that in later years it was compared against Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and against Hurricane Katrina; in addition, it would be the costliest of the three events: Hurricane Katrina comes second with $81\u00a0billion (2005 United States dollars), Hurricane Andrew coming in third. The drought of 1988 qualifies being the costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States.\n1990s.\nDuring 1993 the Southeastern United States experienced high temperatures and conditions of drought for extended periods. The heat waves associated caused the deaths of seventeen people and overall damage from the Southeastern-state drought of 1993 was somewhere between $1\u00a0billion and $3\u00a0billion in damage (1993 U.S. dollars).\ndrought has caused over the United States damage amounting to an estimated $40 billion in 1998.\nSimilar drought conditions hit the Northeast United States during 1999 \u2013 the Northeast, including Kentucky, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland were pummeled by extensive heat waves which killed almost 700\u00a0people across the Northeastern U.S. and unusually dry conditions caused billions of dollars in destruction during 1999. This unusually damaging drought was reminiscent of the Northeast United States drought of the 1960s considering it affected similar states within the Northeast United States and New England.\n2000s.\nThe Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions had a drought during 2002, which was accompanied by dry conditions, wildfires and hot temperatures over the Western US and Midwest areas. The U.S. drought of 2002 turned a normal fire season into a very dangerous, treacherous and violent season. Denver was forced to impose mandatory limits regarding water for the first time in twenty-one years, as Colorado and other states in the Southwest were hit particularly hard by the severe drought conditions in 2002. The Quad Cities had around below average rainfall during 2002 (normal precipitation is every year, during 2002 were recorded). The 2001\u20132002 rain season in Southern California was the driest since records began in 1877. San Diego recorded only , compared to the annual average of . Records were broken in an even worse drought just five years later, during the 2006\u201307 rain season in Los Angeles ( compared to the annual average of ).\nThe U.S. drought of 2002 was reminiscent of the 1988 drought and was compared to the droughts of the 1930s, the 1983 drought and the dry spells of the 1950s. The drought also affected Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta, in Canada.\nAlthough the Western United States and Southwestern U.S. are most likely to be hit, droughts can also happen over the Upper Midwestern States, the Central Great Plains, Southeast United States, the Middle Atlantic, the Great Lakes Region, the Ohio River Valley, Northeastern United States and even New England. Droughts vary in severity and have potential for causing elevated to exceptional damage wherever they focus their area toward.\nThere were extensive droughts through the 2000s (decade) all over the Southeastern United States, continuing as far westward as Texas. The Southeastern United States were affected by heavy droughts extending from the Carolinas toward Mississippi and even into Tennessee and Kentucky. Droughts affecting Florida were so severe that lakes were actually drying out. Wildfires, forest fires, and brush fires were very prevalent in association with the 2000s (decade) drought in the Southeastern United States. The drought of 2006\u20132007 in California contributed to the extreme severity of the 2007 California wildfires.\nMissouri, Arkansas, (portions of) Louisiana, Tennessee, southeast Iowa and northern Illinois were hit with severe droughts and heat during 2005. The conditions caused $1\u00a0billion in overall damage, there were no deaths attributed to the drought and associated heat spells. The Quad Cities themselves received only of precipitation during 2005.\nIn 2008 and 2009, much of south and south-central Texas were in a state of exceptional drought.\nCalifornia also experienced a multiyear drought, peaking in 2007\u20132009, when a statewide drought emergency was issued. Although reports of widespread agricultural losses were reduced in later analysis, large decreases were seen in many fish populations in the region, and additional reliance on groundwater in farming may have set the precedent for further damages in the 2012\u20132015 California drought.\n2010s.\nThe California drought continued through 2010 and did not end until March 2011. The drought shifted east during the summer of 2011 to affect a large portion of the Southwest and Texas. See above for additional information on this drought. In 2013 and early 2014, the California drought returned and intensified, expanding to much of the western US. In 2013, many places in California set all-time low precipitation records, with very little measurable rain falling across much of the state from January 2013 into mid-February 2014. San Francisco nearly halved its previous annual record low in 2013, receiving only 5.59 inches compared to a normal of 23.65. The 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 winter snowpacks were among the lowest recorded in the last 100 years. In January 2014, the state cut allocations from its State Water Project to zero percent (revised upwards to five percent in April), a record low, as reservoirs dropped to critical levels. Municipal districts in the northern and central parts of the state, including the capital, Sacramento, enacted water rationing while over half a million acres (2000\u00a0km2) of Central Valley farmland were fallowed. In 2015, wildfires burned over 7 million acres, primarily in the western U.S. and Alaska, which is approaching the all-time national record.\nIn 2011 intense drought struck much of Texas, New Mexico and a large portion of the Southwest bringing much of the region its worst drought seen since the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s. Most of the drought in Texas ended or had it impacts ease by spring and summer 2012 as precipitation returned to the region, while the New Mexican drought continued unbroken into 2014. The Texas and Southwest U.S. drought was also accompanied by a severe heat wave that brought record setting heat to much of Texas, including but not limited to bringing a 40-day stretch of temperatures at or above to Dallas, Texas. Drought of severe magnitude also affected a large portion of the Southeastern US, especially Georgia and South Carolina. It is believed that a combination of La Ni\u00f1a and climate change had contributed to the intense drought.\nIn 2012, much of the U.S. had drought conditions develop through the late winter and spring months and lasting into the summer, creating the 2012 North American drought. Meanwhile, severe to extreme drought developed in the lower Midwest and Ohio Valley as well as the southern and central Rockies. This led to large wildfires in Colorado including the record setting Waldo Canyon fire, the most destructive in Colorado history. Drought conditions have led to numerous firework show cancellations and voluntary water restrictions in much of the Ozarks, Mid-Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. Lagging effects of La Ni\u00f1a, climate change, and also a large persistent upper level ridge of high pressure present over much of North America since the late winter have all contributed to the drought and above average temperatures since February 2012. This further lead to the vicious cycle of reduced evaporation and decreased rainfall all through the spring of 2012. While the summer of 2011 was the second-warmest () in U.S. history after the Dust Bowl era of 1936 the summer of 2012 was the third-warmest at (). This intense heat wave contributed to the intensification of the drought particularly over the Midwest and the Northern Plains. Because the drought conditions were forcing American farmers to sell off livestock, the Department of Defense sought to buy up meat at \"fire sale\" prices in order to stockpile meals for the lean times ahead.\nHigh wheat prices caused by the drought have discouraged farmers from investing in alternative drought-tolerant crops.\nThe United States Drought Monitor observed \u201cextreme drought\u201d conditions in much of the eastern half of Massachusetts, southeastern New Hampshire and the southern part of Maine in September 2016.\nIn summer 2016, severe drought affected the temperate New England and New York area, including a Massachusetts and New York drought that persisted into the fall. While not as severe as other major, more well-known droughts in the south and west where the climate is semi-arid, it was among the most severe for the northeastern region.\nHydrologist Royce Fontenot said in 2019 that the impact of drought will linger according to the La Ni\u00f1a pattern.\n2020s.\nBeginning in summer 2020, drought was widespread in the Dakotas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas; as well as parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Minnesota.\nIn July 2021, after two more extremely dry winters, Lake Powell dropped to its lowest level since 1969 when the reservoir was first filling. Lake Mead fell to a level expected to trigger federally mandated cuts to Arizona and Nevada's water supplies for the first time in history.\nAs of September 2022, eastern Connecticut is experiencing one of the worst droughts in the last 100 years. Many towns in eastern Connecticut have water restrictions and regional agricultural has been extensively impacted.", "matches": ["droughts"], "label": []}

This multi-year drought began in most areas in 1988 and continued into 1989 and 1990 (in certain areas). The drought caused $60 billion in damage ($ \u00a0USD) in United States dollars, adjusting for inflation. The drought occasioned some of the worst blowing-dust events since 1977 or the 1930s in many locations in the Midwestern United States, including a protracted dust storm, which closed schools in South Dakota in late February 1988. During the spring, several weather stations set records for the lowest monthly total precipitation and the longest interval between measurable precipitation, for example, 55 days in a row without precipitation in Milwaukee. During the summer, two record-setting heatwaves developed, similar to those of 1934 and 1936. The concurrent heat waves killed 4,800 to 17,000 people in the United States. During the summer of 1988, the drought led to many wildfires in forested western North America, including the Yellowstone fires of 1988. \nAt its peak, the drought covered 45% of the United States. That was far less area than the Dust Bowl, which covered 70% of the United States, but the drought of 1988\u20131990 not only ranks as the costliest drought in United States history, it was one of the costliest natural disasters in United States history. In Canada, drought-related losses added to $1.8 billion (1988 Canadian dollars).\nOrigin.\nThe western United States experienced a lengthy drought in the late 1980s. Much of California experienced one of its longest droughts ever observed from late 1986 through late 1992. The situation worsened in 1988 as much of the United States also suffered from severe drought. In California, the six-year drought ended in late 1992 as a significant El Ni\u00f1o event in the Pacific Ocean (and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991) most likely caused unusually persistent heavy rains.\nCultivation of marginally arable land, as well as pumping groundwater to near depletion contributed to the damage from this event.\nDamage.\nThe drought of 1988 ranked as the worst drought since the Dust Bowl, which had occurred more than 50 years earlier. Damages in the United States (as of 2008, adjusted for inflation) were calculated at between $80\u00a0billion and almost $120\u00a0billion. The state of Minnesota alone saw $1.2 billion in crop losses. The drought caused devastation comparable to that of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In Canada, drought-related losses totaled $1.8 billion (in 1988 Canadian dollars).\nFollowing a milder drought in the southeastern United States and California the previous year, the 1988\u20131989 drought affected the Mid-Atlantic states, the southeastern United States, the midwestern United States, the northern Great Plains, and the western United States. Heatwaves that accompanied the drought are estimated to have killed over 5,000 Americans as well as livestock across the United States. The drought destroyed crops almost nationwide, lawns went brown, and many cities declared water restrictions. More than four inches (100\u00a0mm) of helpful rain was brought to parts of the Midwest in September 1988 by Hurricane Gilbert, which crossed Texas and Oklahoma as a tropical depression, weakening as it moved further north into Missouri, and spreading rain as far as the Great Lakes. In some areas Hurricane Gilbert overcame the drought outright, but other locations were at \u22126 or lower on the Palmer Drought Severity Index by early autumn 1988 and a general change in the pattern which had maintained for the preceding nine-plus months was required to ease the hydrological impacts of the drought. The agricultural damage was essentially done by this point, resulting in record prices for commodities. \nWildfires in Yellowstone National Park burned and altered the landscape significantly. The catastrophic drought continued across the Upper Midwest and northern Great Plains states during 1989, not officially ending until 1990. Dry conditions continued during 1989, affecting Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, parts of Nebraska, Minnesota, Kansas and large portions of Colorado. The drought also affected some parts of Canada.\nBeginning in the spring, a persistent wind pattern brought hot dry air into the middle of the continent from the desert southwest, whereas in most years advection of warm and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico is the rule; therefore, despite the extremely high temperatures, elevation of apparent temperature was not as severe as would be the case during the 1995 heat wave.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

The index uses precipitation and temperature data to study moisture supply and demand using a simple water balance model. It was developed by meteorologist Wayne Palmer, who first published his method in the 1965 paper \"Meteorological Drought\" for the Office of Climatology of the U.S. Weather Bureau.\nThe Palmer Drought Index is based on a supply-and-demand model of soil moisture. Supply is comparatively straightforward to calculate, but demand is more complicated as it depends on many factors, not just temperature and the amount of moisture in the soil but also hard-to-calibrate factors including evapotranspiration and recharge rates. Palmer tried to overcome these difficulties by developing an algorithm that approximated them based on the most readily available data, precipitation and temperature.\nThe index has proven most effective in determining long-term drought, a matter of several months, but it is not as good with conditions over a matter of weeks. It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of negative numbers; for example, negative 2 is moderate drought, negative 3 is severe drought, and negative 4 is extreme drought. Palmer's algorithm also is used to describe wet spells, using corresponding positive numbers. Palmer also developed a formula for standardizing drought calculations for each individual location based on the variability of precipitation and temperature at that location. The Palmer index can therefore be applied to any site for which sufficient precipitation and temperature data is available.\nCritics have argued that the utility of the Palmer index is weakened by the arbitrary nature of Palmer's algorithms, including the technique used for standardization and arbitrary designation of drought severity classes and internal temporal memory. The Palmer index's inability to account for snow and frozen ground also is cited as a weakness.\nThe Palmer index is widely used operationally, with Palmer maps published weekly by the United States Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also has been used by climatologists to standardize global long-term drought analysis. Global Palmer data sets have been developed based on instrumental records beginning in the 19th century. In addition, dendrochronology has been used to generate estimated Palmer index values for North America for the past 2000 years, allowing analysis of long term drought trends. It has also been used as a means of explaining the Late Bronze Age collapse.\nIn the US, regional Palmer maps are featured on the cable channel Weatherscan.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

{"id": "24188849", "revid": "38004052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24188849", "title": "Drought in the United Kingdom", "text": "Droughts are a relatively common feature of the weather in the United Kingdom, with one around every 5\u201310 years on average. These droughts are usually during the summer, when a blocking high causes hot, dry weather for an extended period. However this means that droughts can vary in their characteristics. All types of drought cause issues across all sectors, with impacts extending to the ecosystem, agriculture and the economy of the whole country in severe cases of drought. The south east of the country usually suffers most, as it has the highest population (and therefore demand) and the lowest average precipitation per year, which is even lower in a drought. Even in these areas in severe droughts, the definition, impacts, effects and management are all minimal in comparison to drought prone areas such as Australia and parts of the United States. In recent years however, the summers of 2007, 2008, 2009, August 2010 and 2012 were wetter than normal, 2007 being wettest on record.\n, according to the Environment Agency, due to projected population growth and the impact of climate change, England's anticipated demand for water will exceed its supply around the year 2045.\nDefinition and comparison with other countries.\nA drought is usually defined as an extended period of weather (usually around 3 weeks) when less than a third of the usual precipitation falls.\nIn the United Kingdom an absolute drought is currently defined \"as a period of at least 15 consecutive days when there is less than 0.2\u00a0mm (0.008\u00a0inches) of rainfall\", although before the 1990s a drought was defined as \"15 consecutive days with less than 0.25 mm (0.01\u00a0inches) rain on any one day\". This previous definition sometimes led to confusion, as many argued, \"if less than 0.25 mm of rain each day fell in 30 days, is that 2 droughts? And if 0.26 mm fell after 25 days, is the drought over?\" This led to the new definition, but many believe hindsight is the best way to judge if a drought has occurred.\nIn the longer term, drought in the United Kingdom can also be defined as \"a 50% deficit over three months, or a 15% shortfall over two years\".\nCompared to other countries, the United Kingdom definition of a drought is much less severe. In Libya in the Sahel region, a drought is usually only recognized after two years without any measurable rainfall. If this were to happen in the United Kingdom, the consequences would be disastrous.\nA different type of drought is the hydrological or agricultural drought. In this case there is moisture in the soil, but little is getting to vegetation, either because it is frozen (which can occur in severely cold winters in the United Kingdom) or because of very high temperatures which mean that the rate of evapotranspiration exceeds the rate of uptake of water from the plant (which can be seen in the United Kingdom, on hot days, when plants wilt as their stores of water are depleted).\nA hydrological drought can occur after a relatively dry winter, when the soil moisture storage, reservoirs and water table have not risen enough to counteract the warm summer weather. These sorts of conditions can persist over several years, even with above average rainfall, as the rainfall only slowly percolates through the water stores and replenishes them.\nCauses.\nThe main cause for a long spell of dry weather in the United Kingdom is usually a blocking anticyclone (often the Azores High) system that forces other low-pressure systems around it, usually to the northwest. This can happen any time of year, but brings hot sunny weather in summer and dry, cold and foggy weather in winter. This is why in dry spells the northwest of the United Kingdom actually often receives above average rainfall, as depressions and associated fronts are pushed towards the north.\nA severe drought in the United Kingdom needs to have the high pressure in charge of the weather for an extended period, commonly for weeks or even months at a time. Most often sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and intensification of the mid latitude westerlies in the Pacific can bring a stable anticyclone, meaning that the pressure can remain above average for weeks, or even months at a time, allowing the heat to build and dry weather to continue during the anticyclonic system.\n, according to the Environment Agency, due to the impact of climate change, England's anticipated demand for water will exceed its supply around the year 2045. Leaks in water supply lose water and investment in plugging leaks is needed. Tom Bradshaw of the National Farmers\u2019 Union called for increased investment in water irrigation, reservoirs on farms and an improved plan to manage water resources. Martin Baxter of the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment said, \u201cWhat we are seeing now is that climate impacts in terms of more extreme weather events are happening more frequently and at a greater magnitude than was anticipated. We have really got to become more resilient to what we know is on the way.\u201d\nNotable events.\nSeveral notable droughts in the United Kingdom have occurred in recorded history, some of these in the 21st century. They can be divided into two categories, the meteorological drought where little or no rain fell over a relatively short period and the hydrological drought, where below average rainfall has occurred over an extended period.\nMeteorological droughts.\nOne of the most severe meteorological droughts in recent times was in 1976, when a dry 1975\u201376 winter was followed by one of the hottest and driest summers since records began. The drought effectively began in October 1975, but with low temperatures and therefore low evaporation rates during the winter, the below average rainfall did not present an immediate problem. As the dry winter ended and was followed by the hot and particularly dry summer of 1976, the drought became one of the most famous in United Kingdom history.\nThe drought became a serious problem in late spring. In April, no rain fell in parts of Cornwall; and then in June, no rain fell over Devon and Kent. In August no precipitation was measured in North Wales. This meant that in some places, less than half the average rainfall was measured from October 1975 to August 1976. For example, in Kew, just 235\u00a0mm (9.25\u00a0inches) of rain was measured over that period, which was 43% of the average, meaning the amount of rainfall was comparable to a semi-arid climate. In Devon and Dorset, some locations received no rainfall for 45 consecutive days through July and August, another United Kingdom record. This was on top of another three periods of absolute drought, totalling 58 days with no measurable precipitation.\nThe lack of rain can be attributed to the high pressure system over the United Kingdom at the time, which meant average pressure was 5 millibars above the expected for the summer months.\nThis drought was intensified by the exceptional heat that continued through it. Records were set for the heat as well as the lack of rain, resulting in very high evaporation rates. From 23 June, temperatures were over for two consecutive weeks around the United Kingdom, peaking at on 28 June at Mayflower Park in Southampton. The highest temperature in the summer was at Cheltenham on 3 July. The effects of the drought included substantial and long-lasting changes to the tree composition of forests. The European Beech was severely affected by the drought and took around twenty years to recover. To date, its growth has failed to recover completely, reaching only about 75% of their pre-drought growth rates, even decades after the drought. Additionally, death due to drought resulted in the loss of around 15% of the mature beech trees in the forest. In contrast, the sessile oak did not suffer any death or growth suppression due to drought, but instead benefited from reduced competition with beech. Sessile oak growth increased suddenly after the drought and remained unusually high until the 1990s, when beech recovered and regained dominance. European Beech dominates temperate forests over large areas of Europe, but is considered to be particularly drought-sensitive and is predicted to be outcompeted by more drought-tolerant species in many regions as the climate warms.\nAnother event like the 1976 drought was in the summer of 2003. This was also notable for the temperatures, with being hit in the United Kingdom for the first time since records began, with a top temperature of recorded in Faversham, Kent, and some places recording up to, or above, unofficially. This drought and the associated heat wave affected the whole of Europe, not just the United Kingdom, as with the 1976 event. The average temperature was the highest since 1868, measured over February to September. This added to the severity of the drought, with high rates of evaporation. The summer ranked as the 4th highest for potential evaporation since 1961, and this evaporation alone exceeded rainfall totals across a third of the United Kingdom.\nThe United Kingdom had its driest February to October period since 1921, and in the drought period had conditions only comparable to the previous conditions of 1976. Over the whole of the United Kingdom, the rainfall totals were the 3rd lowest since records began in 1900, and in some regions only 25% of the average rainfall fell in this period. Scotland suffered during this period as it had its driest spell since the 1955 drought, and coupled with a dry winter here (England and Wales had relatively wet winters as depressions were forced south) this led to a hydrological drought here too. Also, with several local convective thunderstorms missing specific areas, some localities had exceptionally low rainfall totals, compared to the average, with some places having their driest February to October since 1697.\nThe drought ended in October when a low pressure system finally arrived to bring substantial rain to the United Kingdom. Some areas in Southern England had more rain in this 6 day period than they had received in the previous 3 months. Fortunately the preceding winter of 2002-2003 was relatively wet, which reduced the severity of the drought greatly, unlike the dry 1975-76 winter which led into 1976.\nHydrological droughts.\nA significant hydrological drought occurred in the United Kingdom between 1995 and 1998, when the warm, dry summers were followed by dry, cool winters. This meant that over the three years, the lack of winter precipitation failed to counteract the dry summers, so slowly the water table fell, and reservoir water levels began to fall. Water levels were only replenished after some exceptionally wet years from 1999 to 2002. Similar conditions were felt between 2003 and 2006, with only the record breaking rainfall of 2007 and 2008 replenishing the water levels.\nImpact.\nUnited Kingdom droughts have similar consequences to other droughts elsewhere in the world. The first of these is river and reservoir levels begin to drop as rainfall fails to counteract evaporation.\nAs drought conditions continue, groundwater levels drop and this provides excellent conditions for fires to develop. With hot, dry weather and no moisture underground, trees lose moisture and become very flammable in dry conditions. This leads to wildfires which usually is the main impact of drought in the United Kingdom, with moorland vegetation such as heather badly affected as the peat bogs dry out. Also, these fires can continue, even when seemingly put out, as the smoldering peat re-ignites the dry vegetation. However, during severe droughts, many trees can burn, and people's lives can be at risk, as in the 1976 drought when a fire encroached on a hospital, and only a wind direction change saved the patients' lives. As embers can be transported easily, and if drought is severe enough, fires can start miles away from their original position as they are transported by wind and even dust devils. With these situations, roads are often closed to prevent loss of life and further damage. These fires also can destroy wildlife habitats, and this can also threaten wildlife.\nOften, in severe droughts, crops can fail as the soil does not contain sufficient moisture to keep them alive and this is usually the largest economic impact with \u00a3500 million ($830 million) worth of damage from failed crops in 1976. Another, more subtle impact is the insurance claims from damage to houses and businesses from fire and subsidence (caused by the dry and shrunken soil), sometimes amounting to over \u00a350 million ($83 million) in severe droughts.\nResponses and management.\nThe responses to drought in England are managed by the Environment Agency. There are four stages to drought management, applying to both businesses and homes.\nThe first of these is a media campaign, urging people to save water and thus avoid the need to take specific measures. For example, use a water butt to collect any rainfall.\nIf drought continues, and water levels continue to decrease, further measures are brought in to save water. This includes a hosepipe ban, which forbids the use of hosepipes, and can be applied to hot tubs, pressure washers and other similar devices in a future drought. These measures were brought in, particularly the ban on hosepipes, in 1976 and 2006.\nThe third stage involves conserving any non-essential supplies of water. These measures are brought in when no precipitation is forecast and water supplies are already very low. The options include:\nThese measures were also brought in during the 1976 drought.\nThe fourth and final stage involves drastic measures of water rationing to all businesses and homes in the United Kingdom in an emergency drought order. The measures are brought in only in exceptional conditions of extended periods with little or no rainfall. This means no water supplies at certain times of the day, or allowing water for a specific amount of time. Standpipes and water tankers can be used as a last resort to have only set amounts of water given to each household in a neighbourhood. Again, these measures were used during the 1976 drought.\nAlso, each area in the United Kingdom has its own drought plan, for the event of any future drought.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

It commenced with low rainfall conditions in late 1996 and through 1997, and worsened through particularly dry years in 2001 and 2002. By 2003 it was recognised as the worst drought on record.\nThe year 2006 was the driest on record for many parts of the country and conditions remained hot and dry through to early 2010. The emergence of La Ni\u00f1a weather conditions in 2010 rapidly ended the drought, and led to floods in some locations, particularly in central and southern Queensland.\nThe drought placed extreme pressure on agricultural production and urban water supply in much of southern Australia. It has led to the construction of six major seawater desalination plants to provide water to Australia's major cities, and to changes in the management of water in the Murray\u2013Darling basin, particularly the formation of the Murray\u2013Darling Basin Authority.\nPrelude to drought.\nBeginning in the second half of 1991, a very severe drought occurred throughout Queensland which intensified in 1994 and 1995 to become the worst on record.\nBy October 1994, part of the upper Darling River system had collapsed and the Condamine River had reverted to a series of ponds. Across the state 40% of Queensland was drought declared. From July to August 1995 the drought was further influenced by a strong El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern associated with high temperatures. According to Primary Industries Minister, Ed Casey, \"the drought affected region stretched in a 200\u00a0km to 300\u00a0km wide strip from Stanthorpe to Charters Towers\". So few wheat and barley crops survived, about half the usual for that year, that grains had to be imported from other states.\nGeographic and seasonal characteristics, and compounding factors.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has characterised the Millennium Drought as primarily affecting:\nAlthough the period of the Millennium Drought was characterised by several El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns, which affect the entire southern Pacific region and typically bring hot and dry conditions to eastern Australia, it cannot be explained purely by natural variability. The Bureau of Meteorology concluded that climate change exacerbated the extent and severity of the drought.\nThe effects of the drought on water availability was compounded by historically high temperatures over the same period. The Bureau of Meteorology's head of climate analysis, David Jones, released statistics showing that in 2007 South Australia, NSW, Victoria, the ACT and the Murray\u2013Darling basin all set temperature records by a very large margin. 2007 was the eleventh year in a row that the Murray\u2013Darling basin had experienced above average temperatures and was (at that time) Australia's sixth-warmest year on record. Jones warned that \"There is absolutely no debate that Australia is warming... it may be time to stop describing south-eastern Australia as gripped by drought and instead accept the extreme dry as permanent.\"\nTimeline.\n1996 to 2000: patchy rainfall in the south-east.\nDry conditions began to emerge in south-eastern Australia during late 1996 and accentuated during the strong 1997 El Ni\u00f1o event. Rainfall in 1998, 1999 and 2000 was closer to average, with isolated areas affected by rainfall well below average.\n2001 to 2005: El Ni\u00f1o brings on strong drought conditions.\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology, much of eastern Australia experienced a dry 2001. 2002 was one of Australia's driest and warmest years on record, with 'remarkably widespread' dry conditions, particularly in the eastern half of the country which was again affected by El Ni\u00f1o conditions. It was, at the time, Australia's fourth-driest year since 1900.\nThe El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern broke down during 2003 but occasional strong rainfall in 2003 and 2004 failed to alleviate the cumulative effect of persistently low rainfall in south-eastern Australia, with some measurement stations having recorded below average rainfall for eight consecutive years. Rainfall in early 2005 remained below average, and better rainfall in the second half of the year again failed to break continuing drought conditions in the south-east.\n2006 and 2007: extreme dry and hot conditions in the Murray\u2013Darling basin.\nSouth-east Australia experienced its second-driest year on record in 2006, particularly affecting the major agricultural region of the Murray\u2013Darling basin. Despite slightly above normal summer/autumn rainfall, the late-winter to mid-spring rainfalls failed, resulting in the 2006 annual rainfall being 40 to 60% below normal over most of southern Australia. The average rainfall in the state of South Australia was the lowest since 1900 with only of rain recorded compared to the normal winter/spring average of . Across Victoria and the Murray\u2013Darling Basin the season was the second-driest since 1900. While New South Wales' rainfall was boosted by above normal falls along the north coast of the state, the state's average rainfall for the season was the third lowest since 1900. The situation was exacerbated by temperatures being the highest on record since the 1950s.\nIn early 2007, senior weather forecasters predicted that the drought would ease along the east coast with a return to average rainfall from late February 2007. Forecasters believed that the El Ni\u00f1o effect that had been driving the drought since 2006 had ended.\nHowever, this did not turn out to be correct as 2007 saw record temperatures across the south of Australia, and only patchy rain. Promising early year rains transitioned into a very dry July\u2013October period. Heavy rainfall in June and July, particularly in coastal regions of New South Wales and in Victoria's Gippsland region, together with tentative forecasts of a La Ni\u00f1a event, brought hope that the drought may have ended. In August 2007, the Darling River flowed again after nearly a year of no flows; however, the Murray-Darling Basin experienced their seventh consecutive year of below-average rain and inflows into the Basin during the winter of 2007 were still amongst the lowest on record, though marginally better than those of the winter of 2006 which had been the driest on record.\nAt the end of 2007 the Bureau of Meteorology estimated that south-eastern Australia had missed the equivalent of a full year's rain in the previous 11 years.\n2008 and 2009: continuing hot and dry conditions.\n2008 and 2009 saw continuing hot and dry conditions in south-eastern Australia, with occasional heavy rainfall failing to break the continuing drought. The effects of the drought were exacerbated by Australia's (then) second-hottest year on record in 2009, with record-breaking heatwaves in January, February and the second half of the year.\nThe drought in Sydney eased around April 2008 and Sydney's main water catchments reached 65 percent, 25 per cent fuller than they were at the same time the previous year. However, Victoria remained drought affected, with Melbourne's water supplies dipping to around 30% by July 2008. In Tasmania drought conditions worsened in 2008, with many areas reporting no significant rainfall for three years.\n2010 and 2011: La Ni\u00f1a finally breaks the drought.\nAustralia's weather pattern transitioned rapidly to a wet La Ni\u00f1a pattern during the autumn of 2010, resulting in record-breaking rains in the Murray-Darling basin and well above average rainfall across the south-east. For many locations this was the first year of above-average rainfall since 1996. The rainfall dramatically increased surface water storage and soil moisture, effectively ending the drought in the south-east.\nWhile 70% of New South Wales was in drought at the beginning of 2010, the entire state was officially out of drought by December. The entire state experienced its wettest spring on record. Several rivers, including rivers in the outback had flooded several times, and many dams were overflowing, including the Burrendong, Burrinjuck and Pindari Dams. Canberra's dams were above 90% capacity.\nThe 2010 Victorian storms in March did little to help Melbourne's storage levels, but steady winter rains, and the 2010 Victorian floods in September, rapidly increased storage levels. Melbourne also recorded its average annual rainfall in 2010 for the first time since 1996, and its wettest spring since 1993. By 2011, Victoria was drought free for the first time in almost 15 years and was instead gripped by very wet conditions and severe flooding.\nQueensland experienced heavy storms in December 2010 and January 2011, resulting in widespread flooding.\nDespite Western Australia experiencing its fifth-wettest spring on record, drought in the South West, Gascoyne and Pilbara regions of Western Australia's intensified in 2010, with the regions experiencing their driest year on record. Perth's dams registered their lowest inflows on record with the city itself recording its third-driest year on record, along with the hottest spring on record.\nIn South Australia, only two regions in the Riverland remained in drought. Heavy rains elsewhere led to bumper harvests over much of the state, this in turn led to the largest mouse plague since 1993 across parts of South Australia, West Australia and Victoria. While some farmers tried to replant, in some areas many gave up as millions of mice covered their fields. Farmers often characterised the plague as being worse than the drought.\nEffects of the drought.\nAgriculture.\nAgricultural production was severely affected. Australia's cotton production had dropped, with the smallest area planted in 20 years, a 66% reduction compared to five years earlier which was considered a \"normal\" year. The crop had been half its usual size for three of the previous five years. Water use by the industry fell by 37% between 2000/01 and 2004/05, due mainly to the drought. On the order of 20 cotton communities and 10,000\u00a0people directly employed by the cotton industry were impacted by the drought. The main areas affected were in New South Wales: Menindee where the area under production was reduced by 100%, Bourke had reduced the area under production by 99%, Walgett has reduced the area under production by 95%, the Macquarie River has reduced the area under production by 74% and the Gwydir River had reduced the area under production by 60%. In Queensland the worst-affected areas were Biloela which reduced the area under production by 100%, at Dirranbandi there was a 91% reduction, Central Highlands had reduced the area under production by 82% and Darling Downs had reduced the area under production by 78%. Bourke had adequate water for only one cotton crop from 2001 to 2006. Stock feed was also becoming scarce and farmers were finding it difficult to feed cattle and sheep. Dairy producers were hit particularly hard by the drought with 2004 a particularly bleak year in the sector, as a drought-caused drop in production sent revenue in the industry down by 4.5%.\nEnvironment.\nIn June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October of that year.\nThe very low flow to the Lower River Murray in South Australia (over Lock 1) resulted in the lowest water levels in over 90 years of records. The lowest water levels during the extreme low flow period were reached in April 2009 and represented a 64% and 73% reduction in the volume of Lakes Alexandrina and Albert respectively. The low water levels and inflows meant there was no outflow from the lake system during the extreme low flow period. During this period the lake levels fell below mean sea level (approximately +0.2 m AHD) downstream of the barrages, reversing the usual positive hydraulic gradient from the lake to the sea. The seawater intrusion, lack of flushing, evapoconcentration and increased resuspension resulted in severe water quality impacts\nExposure and oxidation of acid sulfate soils due to falling water levels from 2007\u20132009 in the Lower River Murray and Lower Lakes also resulted in acidification of soils, lake and ground water. Large scale engineering interventions were undertaken to prevent further acidification, including construction of a bund and pumping of water to prevent exposure and acidification of Lake Albert. Management of acidification in the Lower Lakes was also undertaken using aerial limestone dosing.\nIronically, the easing of the drought led to a large blackwater (low dissolved oxygen) event across a large area of the River Murray during high flows in 2011. Organic carbon (dead plant material) that had been retained in the landscape during the drought was mobilised into the river system and the breakdown of this consumed dissolved oxygen.\nThe environmental legacy of the drought persists in parts of the system. For example, as of 2014 Lake Albert salinity was still elevated four years after the drought, and acidity persists in soils and groundwater.\nUrban water.\nAustralia had previously relied solely on water from dams for agriculture and consumption. The drought changed the way Australia treated its water resources. Because of the long-term effects of the drought now showing, many state governments attempted to \"drought-proof\" their states with more permanent solutions such as grey-water water-recycling, government rebates for home-owners to install water tanks, and tougher restrictions on industries.\nThe citizens of Toowoomba voted on, and rejected, a referendum on using recycled sewage water. As a result, no recycled sewage was added to Toowoomba's drinking supply.\nMost Australian mainland capital cities faced a major water crisis with less than 50% of water storages remaining.\nSydney.\nPlans for a desalination project in Sydney were temporarily halted in 2005 after public opposition and the discovery of new underground aquifers. By late 2006, however, with Sydney's water storages plunging to their lowest levels since the 1950s \u2013 around 33% of capacity \u2013 the authorities decided to reinstate the project. A$1.8 billion desalination plant was then constructed at Kurnell, in southern Sydney, opening in the summer of 2009\u201310.\nThe drought in Sydney eased around April 2008 and Sydney's main water catchments reached 65 percent, 25 per cent fuller than they were at the same time the previous year.\nMelbourne.\nMelbourne had rain up to 90% below the average for September and October 2006, compounding the problem of extremely low rainfall from the preceding winter months. Melbourne had also experienced high temperatures throughout October causing increased evaporation of water in dams and reservoirs, which resulted in their levels falling by around 0.1% a day. As a result of all these factors Melbourne was put on tight water restrictions and as of July 2009, water levels in its dams were at a mere 27% of capacity.\nMelbourne had had Stage 3a water restrictions from 1 April 2007, and narrowly avoided Stage 4 restrictions, with the minimum storage level of around 25.8% remaining above the threshold of 25% for enacting Stage 4. This led to the construction of the North-South Pipeline which would divert water out of the Goulburn River and supply it to Melbourne to meet water demands. Many towns in Victoria were close to running out of water, with some of the few Victorian towns without water restrictions being in the East Gippsland water area, where reservoir levels were above 80%.\nThe Victorian Government also began building a $3.1 billion 150Gl (gigalitre) desalination plant, one of the world's largest. When completed in 2011, it would be capable of supplying up to a third of Melbourne's water needs.\nThe 2010 Victorian storms in March did little to help Melbourne's storage levels, but steady winter rains, and the 2010 Victorian floods in September, rapidly increased storage levels. 2010 saw Australia officially record its wettest spring on record due to a moderate to strong La Nina developing over the region. Water restrictions were reduced to stage 3 on 2 April, and stage 2 on 1 September.\nBrisbane.\nBrisbane water levels reduced to under 20% of capacity, having had no substantial inflow for five years.\nBrisbane organised to be supplied via larger dams, a pipeline and possibly also recycling. The Gold Coast Desalination Plant was constructed at Bilinga, delivering water from 2009.\nThe drought in Queensland had mostly eased with Brisbane recording very heavy rain in May 2009, and premier Anna Bligh announcing that South East Queensland was no longer experiencing drought. Brisbane's dams were now at full capacity with the state in general experiencing its wettest spring on record. The end of the drought and heavy spring rains in Queensland culminated with devastating floods in December 2010 and January 2011.\nPerth.\nIn November 2006 Perth completed a seawater desalination plant that will supply the city with 17% of its needs.\nIn 2010 Perth's dams registered their lowest inflows on record with the city itself recording its third-driest year on record, along with the hottest spring on record.\nAdelaide.\nIn South Australia work on a small pilot desalination plant at Port Stanvac, costing $10 million and with a capacity of 100,000 litres per day, commenced in January 2008, and was completed on 4 August 2008. In 2007 the Federal Government pledged to contribute funds and construction began on a $1.1 billion desalination plant with a capacity of 50 gigalitres.\nIn June 2009 the South Australian Government announced that the plant's annual output was to be doubled from 50Gl to 100Gl, approximately 270 megalitres per day, providing up to 50% of Adelaide's domestic water supply.\nElectricity supply.\nThe drought had a material impact on Australia's National Electricity Market, particularly during autumn and winter 2007. It reduced output from major hydro-electric generators Snowy Hydro and Hydro Tasmania, and also constrained output from some coal-fired generators that use fresh water for cooling.\nThe Australian Energy Regulator found that these effects led to noticeably higher prices from around March 2007, but that these effects had largely eased by September.\nPolicy responses.\nNational Plan for Water Security.\nThen Prime Minister John Howard responded to extreme weather conditions to announce a major water policy reform agenda in January 2007, known as the National Plan for Water Security.\nThis led to the passage of the \"Water Act (2007)\" by the Commonwealth Parliament, the formation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority in 2008 and the publication of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan under the Gillard government in 2012.\nDrought assistance.\nOn 27 April 2012, Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig stated that the two final areas in Australia receiving federal 'exceptional circumstances' drought support, Bundarra and Eurobodalla in New South Wales, would cease being eligible the following week. The Federal Government had provided $4.5 billion in drought assistance since 2001. The related move to end the exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidy program was criticised as premature by the NSW Farmers Association and National Farmers' Federation. Research has shown the failure of crops and the financial problems this brings about can lead to increased stress and even suicides in some cases. To counter this rural Victoria invested in improving their mental health services during the drought period of 2001 to 2007. This played a major role in reducing the number of drought related suicides during this period.\nReferences.\n ", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Ralph Hall, speaking in support of the bill, said that \"the National Integrated Drought Information System has been a highly effective program that provides the best available information and tools to monitor and predict droughts, assess the potential impacts, and better prepare for and mitigate the effects of droughts.\"\nSupporters of the bill argued that the system is necessary to collect information needed to analyse weather and climate data. Executive Director of the Western States Water Council Tony Willardson argues in favor of the bill, saying that \"it's hard to analyze data you don't have... NIDIS is a very important tool for evaluating the impacts of drought. It's what we've been looking for, for a long time, as a clearinghouse of drought information.\"", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Somalia is currently facing its seventh consecutively poor harvest and food stability is a major issue. In the April\u2013June rainy season little to no rainfall occurred across much of Somalia in April, but rain has begun and is forecasted in May. Lack of potable water has accelerated an acute watery diarrhea-cholera outbreak with an estimated 32,000 cases reported since the beginning of the year. 1.4 million children are projected to need treatment for acute malnutrition in 2017, according to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). FEWS NET expects 2.9 million people will remain in crisis and emergency levels of acute food insecurity through at least June 2017. In March 2017, 1.75 million people received international food assistance, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\nAn estimated 1.1 million IDPs currently live in Somalia, and at least 548,000 additional people have been displaced since November 2016 due to the drought. Most people displaced by drought left rural parts of Bay, Lower Shabelle, and Sool and settled in urban areas such as Mogadishu and Baidoa. Displacement numbers continue to rise as more people leave their homes and displacement monitoring increases. IOM and other UN agencies estimate that the number of IDPs, a highly vulnerable group in Somalia, will rise to 3 million by June if the April\u2013June rains are below average or fail entirely. Additionally, since January 2016, about 56,000 former Somali refugees have returned from Kenya's Dadaab refugee camp to Somalia through UNHCR's voluntary repatriation program and have settled in Gedo, Bay, Lower Jubba, and Banaadir.\nCauses.\nMain causes of the drought and its impact are said to be instability, conflict and climate change with severe weather conditions potentially also playing a part. El Ni\u00f1o may be the drought's cause.\nHumanitarian situation.\nOn 4 March, Somalia's prime minister Hassan Ali Khaire announced that at least 110 people died due to hunger and diarrhoea in Bay Region alone.\nThe FAO Representative for Somalia, noted that the situation in many rural areas, particularly Bay, Puntland is starting to look \"worryingly like the run-up to famine in 2010-2011\".\nThe International Organization for Migration also warned that if \"action is not taken immediately, early warning signals point towards a growing humanitarian crisis in Somalia of potentially catastrophic proportions\".\nHassan Saadi Noor, Save the Children's Country Director in Somalia stated:\nIn addition to drought and famine, diseases, such as cholera and measles were spread.\nAs of March 2017, more than 8,400 cases of the cholera had already been confirmed since January, which claimed 200 lives. On 20 March 2017, at least 26 people died from hunger in the semi-autonomous Jubaland region of southern Somalia, according to the state media.\nAs of July 2017, unclean drinking water had caused over 71,000 cases of cholera or severe diarrhea in 2017, resulting in nearly 1,100 deaths.\nCalls for response.\nImmediate response.\nOn 2 February 2017 a senior United Nations humanitarian official in Somalia warned of a famine in some of the worst drought-affected areas without a massive and urgent scale up of humanitarian assistance in the coming weeks. He also stated that the omission of such an immediate response \"will cost lives, further destroy livelihoods, and could undermine the pursuit of key State-building and peacebuilding initiatives\". On 8 March 2017 United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres urged a massive scale up in international support to avert a famine.\nAdequate response.\nWhile the particular drought can only be dealt with by an immediate response some suggest foresight and preventive, long-term, more cost-efficient and appropriate measures. Esther Ngumbi, researcher at the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology at Auburn University in Alabama, suggests that Horn of Africa's repetitive cycles of drought and hunger crisis should be responded to with \"strategic integration and coordination between governments and NGOs\" to \"help farmers become more resilient to drought and other climate change-related disaster\". Furthermore, she states that once this has been achieved, innovative ways to disseminate available information and solutions to farmers would be needed. Mohamed Abdulkadir, field manager of Save the Children notes that food deliveries destroy local markets. German Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development Gerd M\u00fcller suggested a billion-strong crisis-fund for the United Nations to allow it to act preventively.\nResponse.\nGovernment response.\nOn 28 February 2017, Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed declared the drought a national disaster.\nGermany.\nAccording to reports of 1 May 2017 in a visit to the country Germany's foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel pledged to at least doubling the 70 million euros of aid and stated in a press conference with Somali prime minister Hassan Ali Khaire that the \"international state community has to do more against the famine catastrophe\". Furthermore, he asks the international community to no longer view Somalia as a failed state \"but as a state which laboriously struggles to recreate a reliable state structure\" enabling it to \"guarantee security\".\nEuropean Union.\nAt the International Conference on Somalia in London on 11 May 2017, the European Union pledged 200 million euros. Mohamed thanked the donors, emphasizing in his speech that Somalia wished to stand on its own two feet again, and he calling on the participants at the conference to hold his administration accountable if they failed to achieve this.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

This phenomenon is a natural process of plants and is caused due to the limitation of water around the environment where the plant is situated. In the spectrum of botany, deciduous is defined as a certain plant species that carry out abscission, the shedding of leaves of a plant or tree either due to age or other factors that causes the plant to regard these leaves as useless or not worth keeping over the course of a year. Deciduous plants can also be categorised differently than their adaptation to drought or dry seasons, which can be temperate deciduous during cold seasons, and in contrast to evergreen plants which do not shed leaves annually, possessing green leaves throughout the year.\nBotany.\nIn botany, deciduous is a description of plants that carry out a process which lead to the loss of leaves during a certain time annually. This process of shedding leaves is known as abscission. Deciduous plants represent a variety of plant species among trees, shrubs and herbs. The causes of this phenomenon can vary depending on where the plant or the whole ecosystem is situated at. The characteristics of season, climate, temperate and rainfall of a certain region are all considered as factors that may have influenced the plants to be deciduous or influencing plants to have evolved as deciduous plants.\nCold deciduous species include deciduous plant species that will undergo abscission annually or at a seasonal basis. Cold deciduous plant species focus on conserving its nutrient to survive through the extreme conditions in winter. Drought deciduous species, depending on the region it is situated, would undergo abscission not necessarily due to cold weather, they may undergo this process due to shortage of water which may be limited due to relatively low rainfall and summers with a relatively higher temperature or unexpected prolonged season. Conversely, evergreen plant species carry out abscission in a smaller scale continuously in any seasons throughout the year.\nMechanisms that trigger leaf drop is a process which includes physiological and chemical pathways happening within the plants. These include hormonal changes to gradually reduce the use of chlorophyll and generation of certain pigments which is used normally to generate energy via photosynthesis in summer, which gives the autumn colour of the leaves. Carotenoids are the pigmentation that is responsible for the yellow or brown colour of the leaves as they started to lose the presence of chlorophyll. Anthocyanin is another type of pigmentation that is responsible for giving out red or purple colour of leaves. These pigmentations or the colour of leaves are generated by different concentrations of carbohydrate, nitrogen and chlorophyll. In relationship with the discolouring of leaves, deciduous plant species are able to reabsorb nutrients from the leaves as they progress into abscission.\nThe formation of abscission layer between the stem and the leaf petiole signifies the initiation of abscission. Abscission layer is \nthe region of separation between the leaves and the plant or the lamina and leaf base depending on plant species, which is referred collaboratively as the abscission zone. Within the abscission zones the types of cells are the same as the other parts of the plant, but with slight difference in abundance or quality. \u00a0Sclerenchyma cells appears to be less abundant or weakly developed, Parenchyma cells are thin walled and compactly set with no intracellular spaces and there will be no presence of Collenchyma cells. This combination of cells makes the abscission zone particularly sensitive to the plant hormone known as auxin. Under normal condition, the flow of auxin remain consistent throughout the structures of the plant. When the plant is under stress, either due to climate or environmental factors, the auxin flow will be disrupted or stopped affecting the auxin levels reaching the abscission layer of leaves triggering the elongation of the plant cells within the zone. Subsequently, the abscission zone will break allowing the leave to set apart from the plant.\nFunction.\nDeciduous plant will undergo the process of abscission either seasonally or due to external stress caused by the environment. By doing so, there are both advantages and disadvantages for the plant to lose its leaves rather than solely conserving nutrients and water. Many deciduous plant species make use of their leafless period efficiently by triggering reproductive processes such as flowering. Abscission allows the plant to perform dissemination of reproductive bodies, which includes seeds, fruits and pollens, some deciduous plant species prefer to flower after undergoing abscission. This allows the plant to take greater advantage in reproductive perspective as the plant takes much less energy to maintain itself and survive without the presence of leaves, the plant can utilise wind transmission of pollens effectively. Without the presence of leaves also allows the plant to utilise wind transmission of pollen more effectively or increasing the visibility of flowers allowing insects to spot and access to flowers easier thus pollinating plants.\nDue to the natural structure of deciduous plant species, it has a higher tolerance to environmental stress factors which may cause damages such as branch and trunk breakage when compared to evergreen species. \u00a0Abscission can also be noted as self-pruning of the plant, as the plant will shed leaves along with branches, flowered parts, fruits and injured parts. It is an excretory function of the plants as it removes waste materials that it accumulated throughout the year. Self-pruning also serves the original purpose of deciduous plant which is to remove excessive parts deemed unnecessary by the plant that might be competitive for water and nutrients. Without the presence of leaves can reduce the excessive energy required to repair damages of leaves to keep them functional which can be caused by predation from insects or other physical factors. As deciduous plant species would commit to full abscission to survive environmental stress, they must expend the extra energy that evergreen species will never need to in order to regrow a full new foliage when the harsh environmental condition resile or approaching to the next growing season.\nStrategies in drought.\nEvergreen species are the opposite of deciduous species, evergreens possess a substantial amount of leaves throughout the year. One of the most differentiating characteristics of these plants is featuring roots that penetrate much deeper into the ground allowing evergreens to gain access to water source from underground and survive through a dry season. Plant species that possess features that appear to be in between of evergreens and deciduous can be categorised as semi-deciduous, semi-evergreen depending on their annual abscission and flowering patterns. Deciduous species possess roots that penetrate much shallower into the ground when compared to evergreens, therefore when a deciduous plant is put under stress or whenever the access to nutrient and water is limited due to external factors such as normal seasonal climate change and drought.\nDeciduous plants will carry out abscission in the whole plant completely, which allows the plant to conserve its nutrient and energy to survive. Deciduous plants have a higher photochemical efficiency when compared to evergreen species during times when it has leaves during spring and summer. This allows it to take excessive energy and nutrients for storage and is the main strategy on surviving through days without the aid of chlorophyll and leaves in generating energy.\nApart from the prevention of water and nutrient loss, drought deciduous plant species can remove nutrients from leaves that are about to shed and store them as proteins in the other part of the plant. It can shed their leaves drought-deciduous species can adjust to only discharge nutrient after drought relief for canopy reconstruction and leave growth. Deciduous plant species can resorb Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium which are the fundamental elements required by plants. This can additionally prevent significant impacts due to nutrient losses caused by leaf abscission. During the period after abscission had occurred, reserves of twig nitrogen in drought-deciduous species change accordingly with season or external stress, whereas evergreen species had a constant twig nitrogen level throughout the year.\nEcosystems.\nIn botany, plant and leaf phenology from ecosystems that are situated in high latitudes can be predicted based on seasonal cycle, where four seasons are highly distinctive. Ecosystems that are considered semi-arid and savanna-type (SAST) are less consistent and the range in both climate and plant species within these ecosystems vary significantly. Drought deciduous plants species are often found in SAST ecosystems as they have higher tolerance to unpredicted external stress factors. These plant species are also very common in areas that have relatively dry seasons especially ecosystems that situates at the edges of deserts.\nRegions.\nDrought deciduous plant species can be found in the most part of Europe, the eastern part of North and South America, Southern part of Africa and Southern and Eastern part of Asia, particularly temperate regions that require the plants to cope with water shortages over the course of dry seasons. Common deciduous plant species, either temperate or drought, will appear in temperate deciduous forest biomes which alternates continuously. It usually has distinct seasonal differences, winter, spring, summer and autumn, and an obvious contrast of winter and summer.\nWhereas cold-deciduous plant species are commonly found in regions towards lower latitudes of the planet. These plant species can cope with climatic conditions that are more extreme in respect of temperatures.\nExamples of drought deciduous species.\nDrought deciduous plants are very commonly found near the borders of deserts or along the coastal areas in the Northern Americas. \"Encelia fairnosa\" (commonly known as brittlebush) is a very common broadleaf drought deciduous plant species found near the desert around the northern part of Mexico and along the West Coast of the United States. \"Ambrosia Dumosa\" (commonly known as Burroweed) is a common microphyllous drought deciduous species which is found near those same areas as it lives within similar ecosystems as the brittlebush. Although both these examples are able to undergo abscission in response to droughts or dry seasons, they are from different plant families.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

It is a form of spiritual crisis experienced subjectively as a sense of separation from God or lack of spiritual feeling, especially during contemplative prayer. It is thought that spiritual dryness can lead to greater love of God.\nCatholicism.\nThe \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" (CCC) describes spiritual dryness as a difficulty sometimes experienced in one's prayer life, which may lead to discouragement. Dryness can expose a lack of \"rootedness\" in the faith, but also provides an opportunity to cling more strongly to God. The CCC makes reference to the seed that fell on the rocks in Parable of the Sower, as well as to the Grain of Wheat allegory found in the Gospel of John. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" calls it a form of \"passive purification,\" the fruit of which is \"the purification of love, until the soul is so inflamed with love of God that it feels as if wounded and languishes with the desire to love Him still more intensely.\"\nThe theme of spiritual dryness can be found in the Book of Job, the Psalms, the experiences of the Prophets, and many passages of the New Testament, as illustrated above.\nJudaism.\nThe Nefesh Hachaim deals with this issue, as do the Hassic and Mussar movements.

It was the worst drought to hit the country in 60 years, and it affected most of wheat-producing regions in the PRC.\nDrought.\nCause.\nThe drought began as early as September 2010 in some regions, though widespread lack of rain and snow began in October. The lack of precipitation caused lower than normal snow cover, putting wheat crops at risk of being killed by frost as well as reducing the amount of moisture in the ground.\nEffects.\nThe provinces of Anhui, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Shanxi were impacted by the drought. As well as destroying wheat crops, the drought caused water shortages for an estimated 2.31 million people and 2.57 million livestock. Within the eight provinces, 20% of the farmland and 35% of the entire wheat crop was impacted. By February 2011, the drought hit a total of up to of winter wheat that had already been planted. Some lakes, including Lake Hong in Hubei province, dried up significantly, with the Hubei lake shrinking to one-eighth of its normal surface area and one-fifth its usual depth, forcing 3,234 local residents to relocate.\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the potential of damage to China's wheat harvest was likely a factor in an increase of worldwide wheat prices in early 2011.\nBy the start of June, the drought had affected 35 million people, including 4.2 million facing a drinking water shortage. Direct economic damage had reached 15 billion yuan (about 2.3 billion USD), while several provinces resorted to using cloud seeding to induce artificial rain.\nOn 24 June, 3.65 million people and 3.47 million heads of livestock were short of drinking water in \nthe autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia and the provinces of Gansu and Shanxi despite the flooding in other parts of China.\nEnd.\nDuring late February and early March, three events of snow or rain impacted much of northern China, leaving less than a third of the total acreage of wheat production still affected. The precipitation occurred at about the time wheat planted in late 2010 was beginning to sprout and needed water. Government irrigation and aid efforts also contributed to lessening the impact of the drought. Tian Qi Zhu, a wheat expert at the Shandong Agricultural University, said on 7 March that \"[e]xcept for some areas up in the hill region of Shandong where there is still insufficient water, I would say the drought is under control.\nDespite flooding in many regions by 20 June 2011, a government minister reported that drought was still affecting 72.19 million mu (4.81 million hectares) in unflooded parts of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces and some northern provinces.\nResponse.\nBy early February 2011, the Chinese government had spent nearly US$15 billion in cash payments to farmers and subsidies to reduce the price of materials like diesel fuel, pesticides, and fertilizer. The government announced in early February 2011 several tactics to combat the effects of the drought. On 11 February, it was announced that an estimated US$1 billion would be spent on obtaining water to be used on wheat fields, including drilling about 1,350 new wells and sending personnel from the China Geological Survey and the Ministry of Land and Resources to attempt to locate new below-ground water reserves. On 9 and 10 February, cloud seeding had been used to induce rain, resulting in of snow. Indirectly, the government said it raised the prices of some grains, provided farmers with technological aid, and released grain from its reserves to avoid a spike in prices.\nSome farmers affected by the drought criticized the government for not doing enough to support the agriculture industry during the drought, or for giving aid too late. Others blamed the restrictions on using water from certain sources, intended to go to industrial or residential developments, for increasing the effects of the drought on their crops.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Some plants are naturally adapted to dry conditions\",\" surviving with protection mechanisms such as desiccation tolerance, detoxification, or repair of xylem embolism. Other plants, specifically crops like corn, wheat, and rice, have become increasingly tolerant to drought with new varieties created via genetic engineering.\nThe plants behind drought tolerance are complex and involve many pathways which allows plants to respond to specific sets of conditions at any given time. Some of these interactions include stomatal conductance, carotenoid degradation and anthocyanin accumulation, the intervention of osmoprotectants (such as sucrose, glycine, and proline), ROS-scavenging enzymes. The molecular control of drought tolerance is also very complex and is influenced other factors such as environment and the developmental stage of the plant. This control consists mainly of transcriptional factors, such as dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB), abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element-binding factor (AREB), and NAM (no apical meristem).\nPhysiology of drought tolerance.\nPlants can be subjected to slowly developing water shortages (ie, taking days, weeks, or months), or they may face short-term deficits of water (ie, hours to days). In these situations, plants adapt by responding accordingly, minimizing water loss and maximizing water uptake. Plants are more susceptible to drought stress during the reproductive stages of growth, flowering and seed development. Therefore, the combination of short-term plus long-term responses allow for plants to produce a few viable seeds. Some examples of short-term and long-term physiological responses include:\nRegulatory network of drought tolerance.\nIn response to drought conditions, there is an alteration of gene expression, induced by or activated by transcription factors (TFs). These TFs bind to specific cis-elements to induce the expression of targeted stress-inducible genes, allowing for products to be transcribed that help with stress response and tolerance. Some of these include dehydration-responsive element-binding protein (DREB), ABA-responsive element-binding factor (AREB), no apical meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis transcription activation factor (ATAF), and cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC). Much of the molecular work to understand the regulation of drought tolerance has been done in \"Arabidopsis\", helping elucidate the basic processes below.\nDREB TFs.\nDREB1/CBF TFs.\nDREB1A, DREB 1B, and DREB 1C are plant specific TFs which bind to drought responsive elements (DREs) in promoters responsive to drought, high salinity and low temperature in \"Arabidopsis.\" Overexpression of these genes enhance the tolerance of drought, high salinity, and low temperature in transgenic lines from \"Arabidopsis\", rice, and tobacco.\nDEAR1/DREB and EAR motif protein 1.\n is a TF with an entirely different purpose nothing to do with drought stress. Tsutsui et al 2009 found Arabidopsis DEAR1 (At3g50260) to respond to pathogen infection, chitin, and oligomers of chitin.\nDREB2 TFs.\nDREB proteins are involved in a variety of functions related to drought tolerance. For example, DREB proteins including DREB2A cooperate with AREB/ABF proteins in gene expression, specifically in the DREB2A gene under osmotic stress conditions. DREB2 also induces the expression of heat-related genes, such as heat shock protein. Overexpression of DREB2Aca enhances drought and heat stress tolerance levels in \"Arabidopsis\".\nAREB/ABF TFs.\nAREB/ABFs are ABA-responsive bZIP-type TFs which bind to ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in stress-responsive promoters and activate gene expression. AREB1, AREB2, ABF3, and ABF1 have important roles in ABA signalling in the vegetative stage, as ABA controls the expression of genes associated with drought response and tolerance. The native form of AREB1 cannot target drought stress genes like RD29B in \"Arabidopsis\", so modification is necessary for transcriptional activation. AREB/ABFs are positively regulated by SnRK2s, controlling the activity of target proteins via phosphorylation. This regulation also functions in the control of drought tolerance in the vegetative stage as well as the seed maturation and germination.\nOther TFs.\nTFs such as NAC (composed of NAM, ATAF, and CUC), are also related to drought response in \"Arabidopsis\" and rice. Overexpression in the aforementioned plants improves stress and drought tolerance. They also may be related to root growth and senescence, two physiological traits related to drought tolerance.\nNatural drought tolerance adaptations.\nPlants in naturally arid conditions retain large amounts of biomass due to drought tolerance and can be classified into 4 categories of adaptation:\nStructural adaptations.\nMany adaptations for dry conditions are structural, including the following:\nImportance for agriculture.\nWith the frequency and severity of droughts increasing in recent years, damage to crops has become more serious, lowering the crop yield, growth, and production. However, research into the molecular pathways involving stress tolerance have revealed that overexpression of such genes can enhance drought tolerance, leading to projects focused on the development of transgenic crop varieties.\nDrought-tolerant plants which are developed through biotechnology enable farmers to protect their harvest and reduces losses in times of intense drought by using water more efficiently.\nCollaborations to improve drought tolerance in crop-variety plants.\nInternational research projects to improve drought tolerance have been introduced, such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). One such project from CGIAR involves introducing genes such as DREB1 into lowland rice, upland rice, and wheat to evaluate drought tolerance in fields. This project aims to select at least 10 lines for agricultural use. Another similar project in collaboration with CGIAR, Embrapa, RIKEN, and the University of Tokyo have introduced AREB and DREB stress-tolerant genes into soybeans, finding several transgenic soybean lines with drought tolerance. Both projects have found improved grain yield and will be used to help develop future varieties that can be used commercially.\nOther examples of collaborations to improve drought tolerance in crop-variety plants include the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Aleppo, Syria; the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Andhra Pradesh, India; the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Ba\u00f1os, Philippines.; and the Heat and Drought Wheat Improvement Consortium (HeDWIC), a network that facilitates global coordination of wheat research to adapt to a future with more severe weather extremes.\nImpediments to the agricultural commercialization of drought tolerant plants.\nThe development of genetically modified crops includes multiple patents for genes and promoters, such as the marker genes in a vector, as well as transformation techniques. Therefore, freedom-to-operate (FTO) surveys should be implemented in collaborations for developing drought tolerant crops. Large amounts of money are also needed for the development of genetically modified groups. To bring a new genetically modified crop into the commercial market, it has been estimated to cost USD 136 million over 13 years. This poses a problem for development, as only a small number of companies can afford to develop drought-tolerant crops, and it is difficult for research institutions to sustain funding for this period of time. Therefore, a multinational framework with more collaboration among multiple disciples is needed to sustain projects of this size.\nImportance in horticulture.\nPlant transformation has been used to develop multiple drought resistant crop varieties, but only limited varieties of ornamental plants. This significant lag in development is due to the fact that more transgenic ornamental plants are being developed for other reasons than drought tolerance. However, abiotic stress resistance is being explored in ornamental plants by Ornamental Biosciences. Transgenic Petunias, Poinsettias, New Guinea Impatiens, and Geraniums are being evaluated for frost, drought, and disease resistance. This will allow for a wider range of environments in which these plants can grow.\nDrought-tolerant plants.\nThis is a list of selected plant families, species and/or genus that tolerate drought:", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

If plants do not receive adequate rainfall or irrigation, the resulting dehydration stress can reduce growth more than all other environmental stresses combined.\nDrought can be defined as the absence of rainfall or irrigation for a period of time sufficient to deplete soil moisture and cause dehydration in plant tissues. Dehydration stress results when water loss from the plant exceeds the ability of the plant's roots to absorb water and when the plant's water content is reduced enough to interfere with normal plant processes.\nGlobal phenomenon.\nAbout 15 million km2 of the land surface is covered by crop-land, and about 16% of this area is equipped for irrigation (Siebert \"et al.\" 2005). Thus, in many parts of the world, including the United States, plants may frequently encounter dehydration stress. Rainfall is very seasonal and periodic drought occurs regularly. The effect of drought is more prominent in sandy soils with low water holding capacity. On such soils some plants may experience dehydration stress after only a few days without water.\nDuring the 20th century, the rate of increase in `blue' water withdrawal (from rivers, lakes, and aquifers) for irrigation and other purposes was higher than the growth rate of the world population (Shiklomanov 1998). Country-wise maps of irrigated areas are available.\nFuture challenges to crop production.\nSoil moisture deficit is a significant challenge to the future of crop production. Severe drought in parts of the U.S., Australia, and Africa in recent years drastically reduced crop yields and disrupted regional economies. Even in average years, however, many agricultural regions, including the U.S. Great Plains, suffer from chronic soil moisture deficits. Cereal crops typically attain only about 25% of their potential yield due to the effects of environmental stress, with dehydration stress the most important cause. Two major trends will likely increase the frequency and severity of soil moisture deficits:\nAlthough changes in tillage and irrigation practices can improve production by conserving water, enhancing the genetic tolerance of crops to drought stress is considered an essential strategy for addressing moisture deficits.\nPlant physiology.\nA plant responds to a lack of water by halting growth and reducing photosynthesis and other plant processes in order to reduce water use. As water loss progresses, leaves of some species may appear to change colour \u2014 usually to blue-green. Foliage begins to wilt and, if the plant is not irrigated, leaves will fall off and the plant will eventually die. Soil moisture deficit lowers the water potential of a plant's root and, upon extended exposure, abscisic acid is accumulated and eventually stomatal closure occurs. This reduces a plant's leaf relative water content.\nThe time required for dehydration stress to occur depends on the water-holding capacity of the soil, environmental conditions, stage of plant growth, and plant species. Plants growing in sandy soils with low water-holding capacity are more susceptible to dehydration stress than plants growing in clay soils. A limited root system will accelerate the rate at which dehydration stress develops. A plant's root system may be limited by the presence of competing root systems from neighbouring plants, by site conditions such as compacted soils or high water tables, or by container size (if growing in a container). A plant with a large mass of leaves in relation to the root system is prone to drought stress as the leaves may lose water faster than the roots can supply it. Newly planted plants and poorly established plants may be especially susceptible to dehydration stress because of the limited root system or the large mass of stems and leaves in comparison to roots.\nOther stress factors.\nAside from the moisture content of the soil, environmental conditions of high light intensity, high temperature, low relative humidity and high wind speed will significantly increase plant water loss. The prior environment of a plant also can influence the development of dehydration stress. A plant that has been exposed to dehydration stress (hardened) previously and has recovered may become more drought resistant. Also, a plant that was well-watered prior to being water-limited will usually survive a period of drought better than a continuously dehydration-stressed plant.\nMechanisms of Drought Resistance.\nThe degree of resistance to drought depends upon individual crops. Generally three strategies can help a crop to mitigate the effect of dehydration stress:\nThe Drought Resistance terms in summary (Levitt, J. (1980); Blum, A. (2011) )\nAvoidance.\nIf the plant shows dehydration avoidance, the environmental factor is excluded from the plant tissues by reducing water loss (\"water savers\", e.g. by thick leaf epicuticular wax, leaf rolling, leaf posture) or maintaining water uptake (\"water spenders\", e.g. by growing deeper roots). \n Dehydration avoidance is desirable in modern agriculture, where drought resistance requires the maintenance of economically viable plant production under dehydration stress. The role of dehydration avoidance is maintaining water supply and sustaining leaf hydration and turgidity with the purpose of maintaining stomatal opening and transpiration as long as possible under water deficit. This is essential for leaf gas exchange, photosynthesis and plant production through carbon assimilation.\nTolerance.\nIf the plant shows dehydration tolerance, the environmental factor enters the plant tissues but the tissues survive, by e.g. maintaining turgor and osmotic adjustment.\nEscape.\nDehydration escape involves e.g. early maturing or seed dormancy, where the plant uses previous optimal conditions to develop vigor. Dehydration recovery refers to some plant species being able to recuperate after brief drought periods.\nA proper timing of life-cycle, resulting in the completion of the most sensitive developmental stages while water is abundant, is considered to be a dehydration escape strategy. Avoiding dehydration stress with a root system capable of extracting water from deep soil layers, or by reducing evapotranspiration without affecting yields, is considered as dehydration avoidance. Mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment (OA) whereby a plant maintains cell turgor pressure under reduced soil water potential are categorised as dehydration tolerance mechanisms. Dehydration avoidance mechanisms can be expressed even in the absence of stress and are then considered constitutive. Dehydration tolerance mechanisms are the result of a response triggered by dehydration stress itself and are therefore considered adaptive. When the stress is terminal and predictable, dehydration escape through the use of shorter duration varieties is often the preferable method of improving yield potential. Dehydration avoidance and tolerance mechanisms are required in situations where the timing of drought is mostly unpredictable.\nDrought resistance mechanisms are genetically controlled and genes or QTL responsible for drought resistance have been discovered in several crops which opens avenue for molecular breeding for drought resistance.\nDrought resistance traits.\nResistance to drought is a quantitative trait, with a complex phenotype, often confounded by plant phenology. Breeding for drought resistance is further complicated since several types of abiotic stress, such as high temperatures, high irradiance, and nutrient toxicities or deficiencies can challenge crop plants simultaneously.\nOsmotic adjustment.\nWhen a plant is exposed to water deficit, it may accumulate a variety of osmotically active compounds such as amino acids and sugars, resulting in a lowering of the osmotic potential. Examples of amino acids that may be up-regulated are proline and glycine betaine. This is termed osmotic adjustment and enables the plant to take up water, maintain turgor and survive longer.\nCell membrane stability.\nThe ability to survive dehydration is influenced by a cell's ability to survive at reduced water content. This can be considered complementary to OA because both traits will help maintain leaf growth (or prevent leaf death) during water deficit. Crop varieties differ in dehydration tolerance and an important factor for such differences is the capacity of the cell membrane to prevent electrolyte leakage at decreasing water content, or \u201ccell membrane stability (CMS)\u201d. The maintenance of membrane function is assumed to mean that cell activity is also maintained. Measurements of CMS have been used in different crops and are known to be correlated with yields under high temperature and possibly under dehydration stress.\nEpicuticular wax.\nIn sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), drought resistance is a trait that is highly correlated with the thickness of the epicuticular wax layer. Experiments have demonstrated that rice varieties with a thick cuticle layer retain their leaf turgor for longer periods of time after the onset of a water-stress.\nPartitioning and stem reserve mobilisation.\nAs photosynthesis becomes inhibited by dehydration, the grain filling process becomes increasingly reliant on stem reserve utilisation. Numerous studies have reported that stem reserve mobilisation capacity is related to yield under dehydration stress in wheat. In rice, a few studies also indicated that this mechanism maintains grain yield under dehydration stress at the grain filling stage. This dehydration tolerance mechanism is stimulated by a decrease in gibberellic acid concentration and an increase in abscisic acid concentration.\nSeedling drought resistance traits.\nFor emergence from deep sowing (to exploit dry upper soil), this is practised to help seedlings reach the receding moisture profile, and to avoid high soil surface temperatures which inhibit germination. Screening at these stage provides practical advantages, specially when managing large amount of germ-plasms.\nThe Drought Resistant Ideotype.\nUsually ideotypes are developed to create an ideal plant variety. The following traits constitutes ideotype of wheat by International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT).\nThinner, wider leaves (i.e., with a relatively low specific leaf weight) and a more prostrate growth habit help to increase ground cover, thus conserving soil moisture and potentially increasing radiation use efficiency.\nThe benefit of ABA accumulation under dehydration has been demonstrated (Innes et al. 1984).\n It appears to pre-adapt plants to stress by reducing stomatal conductance, rates of cell division, organ size, and increasing development rate. However, high ABA can also result in sterility since high ABA levels may abort developing florets\nCombination phenomics: overall health of crops.\nThe concept of combination phenomics comes from the idea that two or more plant stresses have common physiological effects or common traits - which are an indicator of overall plant health.\n As both biotic and abiotic stresses can result in similar physiological consequence, drought resistant plants can be separated from sensitive plants. Some imaging or infrared measuring techniques can help to speed the process for breeding process. For example, spot blotch intensity and canopy temperature depression can be monitored with canopy temperature depression.\nMolecular breeding for drought resistance.\nRecent research breakthroughs in biotechnology have revived interest in targeted drought resistance breeding and use of new genomics tools to enhance crop water productivity. Marker-assisted breeding is revolutionising the improvement of temperate field crops and will have similar impacts on breeding of tropical crops. Other molecular breeding tool include development of genetically modified crops that can tolerate plant stress. As a complement to the recent rapid progress in genomics, a better understanding of physiological mechanisms of dehydration response will also contribute to the progress of genetic enhancement of crop drought resistance. It is now well accepted that the complexity of the dehydration syndrome can only be tackled with a holistic approach that integrates physiological dissection of crop dehydration avoidance and - tolerance traits using molecular genetic tools such as marker-assisted selection (MAS), micro-arrays and transgenic crops, with agronomic practices that lead to better conservation and utilisation of soil moisture, and better matching of crop genotypes with the environment. MAS has been implemented in rice varieties to assess the drought tolerance and to develop new abiotic stress-tolerant varieties", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

In parts of India, failure of the monsoons causes water shortages, resulting in poor yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions southeastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Gujarat, Telangana, and Rajasthan.\nHistory.\nOnly about 35% of total agricultural land in India is irrigated and two-thirds of cultivated land is entirely dependent on rainfall. As such, the agricultural production system in the country is more vulnerable to damage from extreme climatic events, which causes increased water stress leading to inadequate water supplies for irrigation. Already, rises in average temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as severe droughts and floods, and the shifting of agricultural seasons have been observed in different agro-ecological zones of India. Long drought spells during Kharif and increased temperatures and unseasonal heavy rains during the rabi season have caused serious distress to the farming communities in different states in recent years. Four major farming systems are prevailing in India: the irrigated system, rainfed system, silvo-pastoral system, and desert farming.\nIn the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines, including the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876\u20131877 famine, in which over five million people died; and the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5\u00a0million died. In simple words, drought has destroyed India on a large scale. Eighteen meteorological and 16 hydrological droughts occurred in India between 1870 and 2018. The most severe meteorological droughts were in the years 1876, 1899, 1918, 1965, and 2000,\u00a0 while the five worst hydrological droughts occurred in the years 1876, 1899, 1918, 1965, and 2000. The drought of 1899 can be classified as meteorological as well as hydrological and was the most severe documented drought India has ever experienced to date.\nDroughts correlate with heat waves (see List of Indian heat waves).\nImpact of El Ni\u00f1o.\nAll such episodes of severe drought correlate with El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Ni\u00f1o-related droughts have also been implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean\u2014in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to 3\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u00a0\u00b0F)\u2014have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies occurred during a sustained warm spell that began in the 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high-pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low-pressure convergence center forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed airflow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the degree of drought. Around 43 percent of El Ni\u00f1o events are followed by drought in India.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

In the more arid parts of Chile droughts are produced when there are low amounts of snow accumulation in the Andes. Chilean coastal basins without snow accumulation are particularly vulnerable to drought.\nThe territory of Central Chile has been affected by long-term droughts in 1280\u20131450, 1570\u20131650, 1770\u20131820 and 2010\u2013present.\nHistorical droughts.\nDrought of 1770\u201382.\nThe 1770\u20131782 period was one of general drought in Central Chile with a total of three non-consecutive years of extreme drought. In 1772 vineyards and cropfields along Mapocho River in Santiago could not be irrigated. This drought led the authorities to begin the construction of the long-planned San Carlos Canal in 1772 to divert water from Maipo River to Mapocho River.\nDrought of 1924.\nIn 1924 a drought spread between Coquimbo and Maule provinces. In Coquimbo Province 70% of the wheat from non-irrigated land was lost while in irrigated areas the harvest loss was of 20%. The price of railroad transport of livestock to places south of Curic\u00f3 was lowered by 40% as there was hardly any grass or plant buds for livestock to eat in Norte Chico.\nRural people in Coquimbo Region flocked around the towns of Illapel, Combarbal\u00e1 and Ovalle. Later the intendant of Coquimbo claimed that about hundred people had left the province as result of the drought.\nGreat Drought of 1968.\nThe drought faced by Chile between 1968, known as the Great Drought of 1968, was one of the largest rainfall deficits in the country during the twentieth century, comparable only to the drought of 1924. The drought had its origin in the low amounts of precipitation that fell in 1967. The area affected by the drought spanned from Atacama Province in the north to \u00d1uble in the south.\nThe drought created huge losses for cultivations of potato, rice, maize, beans. Fruit trees and vineyards were also affected. 100 thousand cattle and 1 million sheep died because of the drought. Milk, meat and wool output declined. By September 1969 only 250 thousand goats remained from an earlier population of 650 thousand.\nThroughout rural Norte Chico, many farmers and communities came to lack water even for human consumption. In 1969 farmers received support of several financial institutions and state agencies including tax exemptions and a line of credit to buy forage.\nIn Central Chile, typical river flow increases in December, but this did not happen in 1968. Chile many farmers decided to not cultivate in early summer due to this and to the known fact there was almost no snow in Andes. Later in summer the rivers did grow due to glacier ablation, causing many farmers to repent albeit it was too late to cultivate.\nThe decline in hydroelectric power generation (The hydroelectric deficit was of 200 MW) was partly compensated by having the thermoelectric plants of Ventanas, Renca and Laguna Verde function at maximum capacity. National coal production from the Lota-Schwager mine was not enough to supply the need and the government authorized the import of 50 thousand tons of coal from the United States, Poland, France and Germany.\nIn the hydrological year of 1969\u20131970 the area affected by the drought diminished from previously spanning the latitudes of 27\u201336\u00b0 S to 27\u201332\u00b0 S.\nDrought of 1998.\nBeginning in January 1997 the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon affected Chile during 1 year until 1998. Sea temperatures were high in the Pacific.\nThe drought of 1998 caused an energy shortage in SIC, Chile's main power grid. The energy shortage was worsened by problems in the Nehuenco Power Plant driven by natural gas. Annual rainfall in Zona Sur was far below previous record lows: in Valdivia only fell and in Concepci\u00f3n just , whereas the lowest before 1996 had been in 1924.\nChilean water crisis.\nThe 1980 Constitution of Chile created under dictator Augusto Pinochet recognizes water as a private property and in 1981, his government rewrote laws regulating water, granting the sale and privatization of water in a manner similar to the stock market. The sale of water rights has been one of the primary factors that led to lower water levels in some areas. Chile began to experience a drought in 2010 and by 2020, precipitation was 20\u201345% of average nationally and 10\u201320% of average in the area of Santiago. By 2022, Chile was ranked 16th of 164 for water stress in the world according to the University of Chile. In April 2022, Chile began a plan to ration water.\nReferences.\nBibliography", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

The drought wiped out 102 million trees from 2011 to 2016, 62 million of those during 2016 alone. The cause of the drought was attributed to a ridge of high pressure in the Pacific Sea\u2014the \"Ridiculously Resilient Ridge\"\u2014which often barred powerful winter storms from reaching the state.\nBy February 2017, the state's drought percentage returned to lower levels seen before the start of the drought. This change was due to an exceedingly wet pattern caused by atmospheric river-enhanced Pacific storms, which caused severe flooding.\nIn mid-March 2019, California was declared drought-free except for a small pocket of \"abnormally dry\" conditions in Southern California. This declaration followed a series of powerful Pacific storms during the first few months of the year, which coincided with the U.S. experiencing drought conditions in the fewest parts of the country since 2000.\nHistory.\n2013.\nIn 2013, the total rainfall was less than 34% of what was expected. Many regions of the state accumulated less rainfall in 2013 than any other year on record. As a result of this, many fish species were threatened. Streams and rivers were so low that fish couldn't get to their spawning grounds, and survival rates of any eggs that were laid were expected to be low. Lack of rainfall had caused the mouths of rivers to be blocked off by sand bars which further prevented fish from reaching their spawning grounds. Stafford Lehr, Chief of Fisheries within the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said that 95% of winter run salmon didn\u2019t survive in 2013.\n2014.\nAccording to the NOAA Drought Task Force report of 2014, the drought was not part of a long-term change in precipitation and was a symptom of the natural variability, although the record-high temperature that accompanied the recent drought may have been amplified due to the enhanced greenhouse effect; human-induced global warming. This was confirmed by a 2015 scientific study which estimated that global warming \"accounted for 8\u201327% of the observed drought anomaly in 2012\u20132014... Although natural variability dominates, anthropogenic warming has substantially increased the overall likelihood of extreme California droughts.\"\nBy February 1, 2014, Felicia Marcus, the chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, claimed the 2014 drought \"is the most serious drought we've faced in modern times.\" Marcus argues that California needs to \"conserve what little we have to use later in the year, or even in future years.\" Pritchett &amp; Manning 2009 showed that the alkali meadow vegetation plant community is groundwater dependent and that this characteristic buffers the system from the effects of drought. This means that certain plants are actually able to help prevent droughts, but can only do so if groundwater is maintained at a certain level. One of the reasons that the study was conducted was to ascertain whether the Owens Valley region of California could handle any practiced or proposed groundwater extraction.\nIn February 2014, the Californian drought reached for the first time in the 54-year history of the State Water Project to shortages of water supplies. The California Department of Water Resources planned to reduce water allocations to farmland by 50%. California's 38 million residents experienced 13 consecutive months of drought. This is particularly an issue for the state's 44.7 billion dollar agricultural industry, which produces nearly half of all U.S.-grown fruits, nuts, and vegetables. This is after the LADWP expected to increase the pumping of aquifers to about a year (City of Los Angeles and County of Inyo 1991) but the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that a sustainable pumping rate is a third lower, at around a year (Danskin 1998).\nAccording to NASA, tests published in January 2014 have shown that the twelve months prior to January 2014 were the driest on record, since record-keeping began in 1885. In mid-May 2014, the US Drought Monitor analysis showed that 100% of California was already under \"Severe Drought\" or a higher level. The 2014 drought is considered the worst in 1,200 years. As California received additional rainfall in December 2014, this was not expected to end California's drought, and trees were at risk due to weakened roots. Experts also noted that due to the soil's extreme dryness and low groundwater levels, it would take significantly more rain\u2014at least five more similar storms\u2014to end the drought. On December 18, it was revealed that almost all of the Exceptional Drought in Northern California had been reduced to Extreme Drought severity, as a result of the winter storms that brought rain to California during December.\nIn 2014, a study by the UC California Institute for Water Resources was released which found that rainfall has been abnormally high since the late 1800s. According to Professor Scott Stine from Cal State East Bay, California experienced its wettest period in seven thousand years during the 20th century, according to his study of tree stumps around Mono Lake, Tenaya Lake and other parts of the Sierra Nevada. Stine was quoted as saying in the \"National Geographic Magazine\", \"What we have come to consider normal is profoundly wet,\". This view was backed by Lynn Ingram of University of California, Berkeley, and Glen MacDonald of UCLA.\nLack of water due to low snowpack prompted Californian governor Jerry Brown to order a series of stringent mandatory water restrictions on April 1, 2015. Brown ordered cities and towns to reduce their water usage by 25%, which would amount in 1.5 million acre-feet of water in the nine months following the mandate in April. However, Brown's water restrictions were been criticized because they were not applied to California's agricultural sector, which uses around 80% of California's developed water supply.\nThe California Department of Fish and Wildlife closed dozens of streams and rivers to fishing in 2014. Lehr has said that he fears coho salmon may go completely extinct south of the Golden Gate Bridge in the near future. In early 2014 the main stems of the Eel, Mad, Smith, Van Duzen, and Mattole rivers were closed pending additional rainfall. Large areas of the Russian and American rivers were closed indefinitely. Most rivers in San Mateo, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties were also closed pending further rainfall. Other actions were also taken, such as releasing more water from the Kent Dam in hopes of raising the levels in the Lagunitas Creek watershed\u2014one of the last spawning grounds that wild coho can still reach.\nProtesters said that banning fishing would disrupt the economy and threaten the livelihoods of individuals who rely on salmon fishing during the winters. Officials, however, highlighted that it would help prevent species that are already in trouble from slipping to extinction.\n2015.\nIn May 2015, a state resident poll conducted by Field Poll found that two out of three respondents agreed that it should be mandated for water agencies to reduce water consumption by 25%.\nThe 2015 prediction of El Ni\u00f1o to bring rains to California raised hopes of ending the drought. In the spring of 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration named the probability of the presence of El Ni\u00f1o conditions until the end of 2015 at 80%. Historically, sixteen winters between 1951 and 2015 had created El Ni\u00f1o. Six of those had below-average rainfall, five had average rainfall, and five had above-average rainfall. However, as of May 2015, drought conditions had worsened and above average ocean temperatures had not resulted in large storms.\nThe drought led to Governor Jerry Brown's instituting mandatory 25 percent water restrictions in June 2015.\nIn response to heightening drought conditions, California tightened fishing restrictions in many areas of the state. Streams and rivers on the northern coast had unprecedented amounts of fishing bans. In February 2015, the California Fish and Game Commission voted unanimously to further tighten regulations on both recreational and commercial fishing, and the U.S. Endangered Species Act listed steelhead as threatened and coho salmon as endangered.\n2016.\nMany millions of California trees died from the drought\u2014approximately 102 million, including 62 million in 2016 alone. By the end of 2016, 30% of California had emerged from the drought, mainly in the northern half of the state, while 40% of the state remained in the extreme or exceptional drought levels.\n2017.\nHeavy rains in January 2017 had significant benefit to the state's northern water reserves, despite widespread power outages and erosional damage in the wake of the deluge. Among the casualties of the rain was 1,000 year-old Pioneer Cabin Tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park, which toppled on January 8, 2017.\nThe drought was largely alleved in California by a persistent weather pattern that allowed rounds of storm systems to consistently hammer the state, with the snowpack rising to well above average. By January 24, 2017, not one portion of the state was in \"Exceptional\" drought, the highest category on the Drought Monitor. On February 21, no part of the state was in the next-lower category of \"Extreme\" drought, and over 60% of the state's area was no longer in any level of drought.\nA record year of precipitation in California certainly brought the state out of the bad situation and more or less back to equilibrium. Unexpectedly, this occurred during a La Ni\u00f1a winter because California typically benefits from the El Ni\u00f1o winters, which were occurring in the recent precious years.\nOn April 7, 2017, Governor Jerry Brown declared the drought over. However, according to the United States Drought Monitor the state was not entirely drought-free until March 12, 2019. The 2020\u20132023 drought began the next year.\nMitigation.\nBeginning in 2008, millions of floating plastic shade balls were dropped on reservoirs to prevent evaporative losses and enhance water quality. An instance of this was performed on the Los Angeles reservoir in 2014. The shade balls were supposed to be the most cost-effective way to cover the body of water amongst all the available options. One of the concerns with this method, however, was the amount of water required to make the shade balls themselves. Scientists determined that the amount of time that the shade balls need to be deployed for the water costs in production to be balanced is between one and two and a half years. In 2018 the \"PBS News Hour\" reviewed the use of the balls, stating that since their deployment in 2014 the shade balls should have surpassed their water cost in the water they have saved.\nLong-term mitigation.\nVoters' approval of the Proposition 1 water bond in 2014 has been interpreted as an eagerness to add flexibility to California's water system. The 2014 Proposition 1 allocated almost 8 million dollars towards various projects related to the conservation and quality of California\u2019s water. The money was supposed to be divided into various categories to distribute the improvement of the state\u2019s entire water system. Four years after this passed, only about 80 percent of the budget has been spent on the improvements laid out in the bill.\nIn early 2016, Los Angeles County began a proactive cloud-seeding program. Cloud-seeding is the process of emitting specific chemicals into the sky usually from the ground or a plane. This is supposed to create an environment with increased rainfall given certain prerequisite weather conditions. Even though many Americans find this process to be almost superstitious, there is science to support its legitimacy. However, rainfall studies have shown rainfall to improve by around 5 to 15 percent in optimal weather conditions. The issue at hand is whether or not the cost of the operation is worth it with the amount of improvement and the reliability.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

A state of emergency was declared on September 28, 2011; with rationing of available fresh-water.\nThe La Ni\u00f1a event that caused the drought ended in April\u2013May 2012. By August 2012 the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Conditions indicated that the tropical Pacific Ocean was on the brink of an El Ni\u00f1o event.\nBackground.\nTuvalu experiences the effects of El Ni\u00f1o &amp; La Ni\u00f1a that flow from changes in ocean temperatures in equatorial and central Pacific. El Ni\u00f1o effects increase the chances of tropical cyclones; while La Ni\u00f1a effects increase the chances of drought conditions in Tuvalu.\nTuvalu relies primarily on rainfall for the majority of its drinking water, which is collected and stored in storage tanks. The country normally receives between 200\u2013400\u00a0mm (7.87\u201315.75\u00a0in) of rain per month during an average year.\nLa Ni\u00f1a effect and drought.\nThe country had been hit by a prolonged period of dry weather in the second half 2011, which had been attributed to the La Ni\u00f1a that results in the cooling of the surface temperature of the sea around Tuvalu which resulted in reduced rainfall. In October 2011, the Tuvalu Red Cross reported that the country had not received normal rainfall in six months, leading to shortages. The capital, Funafuti, and several of the outer atolls had been particularly affected by the drought. Nukulaelae and Nanumaga were the most seriously affected outer islands. The dry conditions on Nukulaelae affected the vast majority of pulaka pits - Pulaka, or swamp taro, is a staple crop for Tuvaluans. On Vaitupu the drought was also severe, but not as bad as the other islands.\nDeclaration of a state of emergency.\nThe government declared a state of emergency on September 28, 2011, due to severe water shortages in the capital atoll, Funafuti. The drought conditions resulted in water being rationed on the islands of Funafuti and Nukulaelae as water reserves ran low. Households on Funafuti and Nukulaelae were restricted to two buckets of fresh water per day (40 litres).\nHouseholds on Funafuti and Nukulaelae were rationed to two buckets of fresh-water a day (40 litres). A resident of Funafuti (in a household of 5 people) is quoted as saying that it is \"hard, very hard\" for her household to get by on the ration of two buckets of water a day. Meanwhile, other Tuvaluans were being forced to pay for imported foods as the consequence of failing crops as the result of the drought. Princess Margaret Hospital limited admissions to try and cope with the water rationing, with a fear that there may be a rise in waterborne diseases due to a lack of public bathing.\nThe secretary general of Tuvalu Red Cross, Tataua Pefe, said that lack of rain had caused the contamination of remaining ground water supplies, \"It's not safe for consumption...Some animals have died recently and we think it's because of subterranean water.\"\nLack of rainfall had affected other countries and territories in the region, including American Samoa, Samoa, Tokelau and Tonga.\nInternational aid.\nNew Zealand began airlifting supplies and fresh water to Tuvalu on Monday, October 3, 2011. The New Zealand government had received reports during the prior weekend that parts of Tuvalu had just a two-day supply of water left, according to Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully. A New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules transport plane landed in the country carrying two desalination units and large containers of fresh water into Funafuti. Australia also sent a desalination plant.\nOfficials from various aid agencies, including the International Red Cross and the Tuvalu Red Cross, worked with the New Zealand and Tuvaluan governments to alleviate the drought and shortages.\nThe government of South Korea funded the shipment of 60,000 bottles of water from Fiji to Tuvalu. The governments of Australia and New Zealand responded to the fresh-water crisis by supplying temporary desalination plants, and assisting in the repair of the existing desalination unit that was donated by Japan in 2006.\nIn response to the 2011 drought, Japan funded the purchase of a 100 m\u00b3/d desalination plant and two portable 10 m\u00b3/d plants as part of its Pacific Environment Community (PEC) program. Aid programmes of the European Union in 2010 and 2011; and Australia also provided water storage tanks to increase storage capacity in the outer islands as part of a longer term solution for the storage of available fresh water. Australia has also funded the installation of water tanks on Funafuti, which project also involved improving roof and gutter systems of households to capture more fresh water. In July 2012 a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the Tuvalu Government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}
{"id": "32953202", "revid": "563447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32953202", "title": "Drought refuge", "text": "A drought refuge is a site that provides permanent fresh water or moist conditions for plants and animals, acting as a refuge habitat when surrounding areas are affected by drought and allowing ecosystems and core species populations to survive until the drought breaks. Drought refuges are important for conserving ecosystems in places where the effects of climatic variability are exacerbated by human activities.\nDescription.\nReliable drought refuges are characterised by the ability to retain sufficient water throughout the drought, having water quality good enough to maintain the life of the ecosystem that are not subject to physical disturbance and that have access to surrounding habitat, so that refugees can recolonise the main habitat when the drought ends.\nFor fish and aquatic invertebrates a drought refuge may be an isolated permanent pool in a stream that ceases to flow and mostly dries up during a period of drought. Permanent wetlands may serve as non-breeding drought refuges for a range of waterbirds that nest at ephemeral lakes when these are inundated.\n\"Drought refuge is a secure place persisting through a disturbance with the critical criterion being that after the disturbance the refuge provides colonist to allow populations to recover.\"\nFor some species the refuge is their only water source and is necessary for survival. For birds and invertebrate taxa, the drought refuge is not only necessary for survival but contributes to their reproductive success. Some organisms are able to adapt to the environment when there is a drought, but adapting traits that will be beneficial for survival in a prolonged drought is extremely difficult to accomplish.\nTerms \"refuge\" and \"drought\".\nThe term \"refugium\" (plural: \"refugia\") was originally used by evolutionary biologists for refuges that protected entire species from disturbance events of large temporal and spatial scales, such as glaciation or the long-term effects of climate change. A disturbance involves a temporary removal of biomass resulting in change in physical environment. Smaller-scale ecologists now use this term synonymously with the simpler term \"refuge\", to define places that protect populations of plants or animals from smaller-scale disturbances, such as fire, flood, storm, or human impacts. Refugia are the habitats or environmental factors that give spatial and temporal resistance and resilience to biotic communities impacted by disturbance. Here negative effects of disturbance are lower than surrounding areas or times. Refugia buffer species long-term, where as, a refuge buffers species short-term.\nThere are other uses of the term \"refuge\", such as for a wildlife reserve or a place free from predators (predation refuge). A refuge is a place or situation that provides safety or shelter. Here, species are minimally affected by changing climate conditions.\nLack of precipitation causes drying of aquatic ecosystems and leads to a natural disturbance called a drought. In order for organisms to survive a drought, the disturbance must be minimal or there must be a drought refuge available.\nEffects of drought.\nThe severity of a disturbance is measured by its intensity, duration, and recovery time. Intensity and duration influence the strength of a disturbance and the likelihood of the survival of organisms within an area. Recovery time influences the level of recovery abundance and composition in a disturbed habitat until next stimulus forces species to seek shelter. Disturbances, such as drought, influence spatial and temporal patterns of refuge use, as well as the role of refuges in community dynamics. Variability in patterns of disturbance affect refuge use patterns and community structure. Decreased time between disturbances increases refuge usage until a certain frequency is reached and the usage declines as a result of the weakening resilience and resistance of a species. Refuge degradation increases mortality for sensitive species during larger disturbance times.\nDroughts decrease surface area and volume, while increasing physical and chemical water quality extremes, such as, temperature levels, oxygen concentration and water levels. This links with interactions that structure the communities of different species and affects mortality, birth and migration rates. During a drought, species must seek refuge or have adaptations that provide refuge.\nHydrological extremes, such as flood and drought, modify habitats. Droughts lead to not only the loss of habitats, but also to isolated habitat patches created by the separation of populations which together form a meta population. Increased density of organisms is another result of droughts. Increased organism density leads to resource limitations, movement limitations, increased competition, and increased predation pressure. Droughts also cause changes in food resources and water quality.\nFunction and importance of drought refuges.\nDrought refuges protect plant and animal populations from extreme weather events as climate trends evolve . They serve as places that support populations of plants and animals not able to live elsewhere in a landscape during disturbance events, whether those events are seasonal and relatively predictable, or otherwise. A habitat's ability to act as a refuge depends on the disturbance. The ability of a refuge to retain water becomes essential for the maintenance of most populations. Refuges of sufficient size and duration maintain populations, sustain biodiversity and may harbour relict populations. They are of particular importance during increasing aridification when few other suitable habitats remain. Biota depend heavily on seasonal refuges. Refuges increase survival rate and recovery time of populations experiencing an environmental disturbance. Refugial effectiveness is the ability of a refuge to fulfill habitat-related criteria. Knowledge of refuges in mediterranean and semi-arid streams and rivers has increased during the last decade.\nThe disturbance process and the recolonization process are two ecological processes which are associated with how refuges function. The disturbance process makes locations into refuges and the recolonization process restocks the wider landscape once a disturbance has passed. Recolonization is driven by resistance, local survival in drought refuges, or resilience, high local mortality with individuals moving back to streams when conditions improve.\nThe processes of disturbance, refuge formation, refuge function and recolonization occur at varying temporal and spatial scales. The spatial distribution of refuges influences the usage and recolonization. Spatial factors alone have a small contribution. Refuges vary with morphological and physicochemical factors as well; contribution is shared. Refuges can be small or large and can be used for short or long periods of time.\nRefugia are relative depending on species adaptations, spatial and temporal scale, and disturbance regime. Many relative influences are unclear as each situation is different. Drought refuges are important for sustaining biodiversity over larger spatial scales.\nPerennial waters are the most important drought refuge. As refuges, they require the least investment by stream invertebrates and have the greatest biodiversity. Perennial surface water is crucial to the survival of macroinvertebrate and fish. Differences in longitudinal pattern affect the location and function of perennial water refuges.\nRefuge occupancy is predictable based on species' traits, but not all suitable refuges within a system are occupied. Refuge community structure is mostly constant because the response to a disturbance carries across a species; the same species takes advantage of the same type of refuge. Refugia play a central role in the structuring of communities. Most non-perennial stream taxa appear to have more than one potential refuge from drought. The primary determinant of which drought refuges a species uses in a landscape are its intrinsic traits.\nThere are specific regions (refuges) to which individuals move during a drought, and within these regions there are specific characteristics of sites used as refuges by different species. A species may use more than one type of refuge during its life cycle. A variation in refuge use is caused by topography, individual species susceptibility and response to disturbance. Patterns of refuge use are influenced by disturbance type, species type, patch size, potential occupants and location. These patterns are poorly understood.\nDrought refuges form habitat mosaics which are prone to increased fragmentation by flow regulation. Some mosaics are more vulnerable to water abstraction than others. The drying of pools results in a patchy mosaic of pools in a dry channel which vary in suitability for different species and life stages. Different species favor different sized pools in different locations with different physicochemical properties. Refuges with low abundance of species require less effort to be adequate than diverse refuges. The size of a pool influences the set of species, total number of organisms, and assembly structure because of physicochemical factors. Species richness and abundance are related to pool morphology. Shade, location, and soil composition are all contributing factors. Heavily shaded pools have colder water, where as lightly shaded pools have increased levels of primary productivity. Large refuges have increased abundance and enrichment and are likely to persist through long disturbances.\nWhile used infrequently and often containing only few individuals during normal years, range edges may episodically serve as refuges from extreme weather events or conditions such as drought. During these extreme conditions, survival probability, reproductive success or both is higher at the edge than in the core of its range.\nRefuge use is influenced by habitat characteristics, such as hydrolic exchange and sediment type, active migration or passive habitat use and species morphology, behaviour and physiology. A decline in refuge use is due to decreased effectiveness of mortality reduction and reduced time provided for community recovery which leads to reduced time between disturbances.\nMovement into and out of refuge creates predictable fluxes of biomass and nutrients. This is important in food webs and the ecosystem. A dense amount of nutrients in one location during a disturbance means increased competition and predation. Rates of mortality, birth, migration, and interactions among components of the biota that have retreated to refugia are affected by the nature of the refuge. The spatial extent, the rate of drying, and the ambient physical and chemical conditions are all contributors.\nDrought refuges for algae are wide- spread because most med-river taxa can survive desiccation and show little specificity for refuges, provided drying occurs slowly. They include dry biofilm on stones and wood, dry leaf packs and perennial pools. Refuges for macrophytes and zooplankton typically comprise egg and seed banks in med-rivers and are resilient to prolonged drying.\nImportance of Refuge Connectivity.\nDrought leads to a shift in refuge spacing and connections at different spatial and temporal scales. Droughts disrupt hydrological connectivity and impact resident species through loss of water and flow from drying, habitat reduction, and reconfiguration. Delivery of water is restricted to areas within a stream network. Habitat patches engineered by members of community serve as refuges that are crucial for other members. Trails and ponds dug by certain species, like alligators, allow for dispersal into refuges. Hydrolic exchange provides movement of water, nutrients, and organisms into a refuge. Populations of sessile organisms, like flora and fauna in perennial water refuges, cannot persist indefinitely without hydrological connections among refuges. Mobile organisms, like fish, will move into a refugia if there are no barriers, like physical obstructions (ex: dams, isolated pools), biotic factors (ex: predation, competition), and physicochemical factors (ex: low dissolved oxygen levels).\nDuring smaller scale, shorter term disturbances, populations within refuges are not necessarily cut off from those in other refuges or those in other undisturbed landscapes, and so genetic exchange can still occur, or will occur during parts of the life cycle not constrained by the disturbance. Under those circumstances, the survival of a species is unlikely to depend upon a single refuge. Recovery processes need to restore connectivity, so that migration can occur from refuges to new patches of habitat. Perennially flowing streams may act as drought refuges for neighboring streams, even if they are not hydro logically connected to them. Refugees must be connected hydrologically at the appropriate times. For insects, refuges on one stream may support recolonization on adjacent streams that are not hydro logically connected, which may also necessitate conservation planning across catchment boundaries.\nThe drought from 1996 until 2009 had a great impact on the Murray-Darling Basin, in Northern Australia (Murphy and Timbal 2007; Umenhofer et al. 2009). When this drought occurred, it dried the wetlands and water storages (the drought refuge). For many species of birds and fish, the refuge is the only freshwater available. The body of water serves as food and shelter; therefore, it must be conserved. Drought refuges are likely to sustain biodiversity over larger spatial scales such as groups of streams or whole drainage networks. Chester, E. T. and Robson, B. J. (2011), Drought refuges, spatial scale and recolonization by invertebrates in non-perennial streams. Freshwater Biology, 56: 2094\u20132104.\nDifferent Types of Drought Refuge.\nA species may use more than one type of refuge during its life cycle. Refugia can be physical characteristics of organisms like short-term behavior or a long-term evolutionary adaptation. Animals and plants have mechanisms to increase resistance (survival) and resilience (recovery) to physical disturbance. They develop adaptations like morphology, physiology, behavior. Physical organism adaptations include an ability to aestivate, mouth orientation that allows for breathing oxygen at the water surface, body armor, and venomous spines. Mobile species' coping methods include refuge-seeking behavior; they seek habitat patches that relieve physiological stress and reduce mortality. Reliance on dispersal improves resilience to climate change in the short term, but over longer timescales, it will not protect macro invertebrate biodiversity from landscape-scale refuge degradation.\nThe hyporheic zone, a region along streambeds where groundwater mixes with surface water, is an important refuge for immobile organisms, like algae. The hyporheic zone protects from freezing, high temperature, and pollution. It reduces displacement, with its relatively stable, slow flow. In a hyporheic zone, free water is retained, and invertebrates remain submerged. The hyporheic zone has been shown to contribute colonists when surface flows recommence.\nPerennial waters, whether pools, seeps or flowing sections of streams, have repeatedly been shown to be the major refuges. Perennially flowing stream sections and perennial pools act as drought refuges for a wider area of the landscape than the stream on which they are located. Refuges of a size sufficient to maintain whole populations, such as perennially flowing reaches, are likely to be most important and may, during aridification, become refugia containing relictual populations. Perennial pools and perennially flowing water generally harbor the greatest diversity of macro invertebrate taxa because they require the least investment by the invertebrates.\nThreats and conservation.\nBecause drought refuges may provide the only sites allowing populations to persist during droughts, they are highly vulnerable to factors that affect water quality such as water pollution and sedimentation from anthropogenic runoff. Consequently, in areas subject to intermittent drought, habitat conservation requires the identification and protection of drought refuges.\nDrought is specific to certain regions and climatic zones. Climate change in many med-regions may prolong dry periods and threaten refuges. The capacity for perennial refuges to support biodiversity may be severely compromised due to increasing water temperatures, reducing the quality of refuges by exceeding the thermal tolerance of invertebrates or by causing anoxia in stream pools and existing environmental degradation of many perennial water-ways.\nDroughts have the ability to reduce agriculture products and be the cause loss of crops and lives. Hence, reserving the refuge is of extreme importance in more ways than one. In order to conserve the drought refuge for these species, action needs to be taken that will effect short term and long term impacts that the drought have on the species that dwell on it for survival. In California, efforts to conserve the drought refuge there, include reserving water when possible. Water conservation is done in order to migrating bird populations (National Wildlife Refuge; March, 1, 2016). The National wildlife refuge also takes part in mowing, disking, spraying and controlled burns. These measures are taken in an effort to stop non-native vegetation from growing; this type of vegetation typically out grows the native when in drought. Thus, allowing for native vegetation to survive during drought, leading to the dependent species to forage on the available vegetation. The clean water act was passed in order to protect the American waters from pollution. Although the act does not protect all waters, it protects many bodies of water. When drought refuges are polluted, they become an even greater danger for the dwelling species. The clean water act is just one step in cleaning waters, and saving drought refuges \"(The Clean Water Rule; National Wildlife Organization).\"\nContinuous threats to the drought refuge conservation include; sedimentation, waterhole pumping, and the lack of the structure of the water, it is not near any other bodies of water. These of course, lead to situations where there is an extreme decrease in water availability. As water availability decreases, it increases the chances for dependent species to die out.\n Groundwater aquifers support drought refuges for water-dependent ecosystems.Pollution and over-extraction of groundwater are both problematic because it lowers its ability to support groundwater-supplied drought refuges. Over-extraction lowers the water table and degrades water-dependent ecosystems. Over-extraction often occurs in areas with surface water scarcity and frequent drought; where groundwater refuges and refugia are most important. Man-made disturbances can mimic the effects of drought, like water withdrawal, and dams. Man-made channel modifications threaten the hyporheic zone as a refuge.\n Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.\n There needs to be an increased focus on conservation efforts. Knowledge of refuge functions is critical for understanding their role in conservation of biodiversity, especially climatically sensitive species. Especially in regions where climate change is increasing the frequency and duration of dry periods. To best conserve species facing extreme weather events, it is necessary to identify conditions \u2018pushing\u2019 species, and, more importantly, to identify the refuge sites to which individuals move. Perennially flowing streams and perennial pools may be crucially important for sustaining biodiversity within a mosaic of stream habitats with drier flow regimes. The primary emphasis of drought refuge protection should be on protecting perennial surface waters and range edges within that landscape. Conservation approaches for river systems will need to focus on identifying and conserving refuges together with maintaining refuge connectivity, reducing the impacts of other disturbances on these systems, and sustaining predictable seasonal flow patterns.\n Releases from hydroelectricity reservoirs could be used to lower river water temperatures or replenish reaches of formerly perennial flow, thereby creating refuges for river biota. Also, focusing on maintaining groundwater quality is more beneficial than focusing on surface water resources. Re-vegetation can reduce water pollution in ground and surface water, benefitting biodiversity. There is increasing evidence that habitats created by humans, such as canals, ditches, and farm ponds can support freshwater biodiversity and, therefore, have potential to provide refuges. They can prevent larger organisms, like fish, from becoming stranded as water levels decrease. While the preservation of refuges is crucial to provide recolonization sources, it is not sufficient if colonists cannot get from the refuge to habitat patches suitable for colonization.\nConversely, where management of pest species is necessary, controlling them in their drought refuges during droughts may be more cost-effective than broad-scale control at other times. One example of this is controlling rabbits in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

With major reservoirs operating at their lowest capacity (the main reservoir system of Cantareira supplying S\u00e3o Paulo being at only 6% of its capacity in early February) officials at S\u00e3o Paulo warned about extended rationing as water may run out before the next rainy season in November 2015. In response, the water utility of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sabesp, has reduced water pressure in the system. It also started to impose punitive tariffs on users who use more than in previous years. By early February residents had started to recycle and hoard water.\nAt the beginning of the dry season in early May 2015, the water crisis continued and water reservoirs in the S\u00e3o Paulo area were insufficiently filled. Work was underway to link up various reservoirs to make better use of existing water resources. By October 2015 the Cantareira reservoirs contained 12% of their capacity while the polluted Billings Reservoir had 20%.\nWith the arrival of the rainy season at the end of 2015, the drought situation improved. In February 2016 torrential downpours caused flooding in S\u00e3o Paulo. Water levels at Cantareira had recovered from 20 percent capacity at the beginning of December to almost 50 percent by mid February 2016. However, Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo still being affected by drought in 2016, and in 5 May the Esp\u00edrito Santo Government declared a state of emergency across the state as the drought worsened.\nThere was concern that an unresolved water crisis may impact the 2016 Olympic Games. In 2017, the rains remained extremely irregular in Minas Gerais, Esp\u00edrito Santo and most parts of the regions Central-West and Northeast. This is the worst drought in Brazil in the last 100 years, according to the \"O Estado de S. Paulo\" in September 2017.\nPotential causes.\nThe drought situation is not unexpected. S\u00e3o Paulo is experiencing its third consecutive year of diminished rain falls. A drought situation was already experienced in early 2014. Water management is poor, pipes leak, and the infrastructure is old. Past reports by scientists, environmentalists and technical experts were overridden by real estate developers and industrial and agricultural interests. Further, lack of protection of watersheds and reservoirs has polluted water sources and made it difficult to bring usable water to the market. The expansion of deforestation activities into the Amazon basin has been linked to the reduction of rainfall in the south of Brazil. Even if the Amazon's evaporation was enough to generate flying rivers, urban heat islands coupled with a heat wave prevented the arrival of humid air masses that generate rain. In turn, Brazilian regions on the way to the Southeast had an uprise of rain, to the point the Central-West and Southern regions suffered from floods.\nEffect on crop production.\nBrazil is the world's third-largest agricultural exporter, and the sector represents approximately 6% of the country's GDP. Irrigation for agriculture accounts for 72% of water use in Brazil, compared to just 9% for urban consumption. Less water supply for crop production lead to \"The Agricultural Economy Institute\" stating that 2014 accounted for S\u00e3o Paulo's worst agricultural losses in half a century.\nThe irregular rainfall pattern contributed to a reduction in crop production through the drought period, due to an atmospheric blockage which prevented a cold front from advancing over key crop regions in Brazil, the world's largest exporter of coffee, sugar, soy and beef. In 2014 the drought wiped out a third of the country's coffee crop in some areas, which caused global coffee arabica prices to rise 50% over the year. In 2015 coffee trees had not recovered from the extreme heat and drought quick enough, triggering another arabica price rally. Crop production of soy, one of the country's largest export crops, decreased by 17% during the drought. The Cemaden's Rain Monitoring System showed that severe droughts were observed in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, they are both the largest regions for soybean production and fourth-largest beef producers in Brazil.\nEffect on hydropower generation.\nAs 70% of Brazil's electricity is generated by hydropower, the lack of water lead to energy rationing in addition to water rationing. In response to decreased hydroelectric power, rolling power cuts were instituted. Water and electricity prices were expected to rise a month or two after the elections in October. Power utilities In Brazil stated that the loss of hydro-generating capacity had cost them 15.8bn reais (\u00a34.3bn). Most of this was spent on more expensive alternative such as oil and other carbon-based fuels that filled the gap in electricity supply. This in turn pushed up Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions in the years of 2015 to 2017.\nPotential solutions.\nAnalysts see the crisis as a relatively short-term stressor but believe that it has the potential to be the \"catalyst\" to solve specifically S\u00e3o Paulo's water problems. Short term solutions include drilling more wells and more recycling of water. Long term solutions include the transfer of more water from additional river basins. Thus, a new 15\u00a0km connection has been authorised to be built to bring water from the Paraiba do Sul river basin to the Cantareira system, watersheds that have distinct aquatic biota. These water diversion projects transport water between isolated river basins, without regard for ecology or aquatic biodiversity. Also, repair of leaking pipes is estimated to save 6% of total municipal water consumption in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nIn 2018, steep fines were implement for above-average water use, but some fear the measure came too late. The Cantareira reservoir was at 6.8% capacity at the start of 2018, even after several afternoons of violent summer rainstorms in S\u00e3o Paulo.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

During this time, Texans experienced the second-, third-, and eighth-driest single years ever in the state \u2013 1956, 1954, and 1951, respectively. The drought was described by a state water official as \"the most costly and one of the most devastating droughts in 600 years.\"\nEffects.\nThe drought began gradually, and some sources claim it began as early as 1947, starting with a decrease in rainfall in Central Texas. By the summer of 1951, the entire state was in drought. Texas ranchers attempted to evade the effects of the drought by moving their cattle north to Kansas, but the drought spread to Kansas and Oklahoma by 1953. At that point, 75% of Texas recorded below-normal rainfall amounts, and over half the state was more than 30 inches below normal rainfall. By 1954, the drought had affected a 10-state area reaching from the Midwest to the Great Plains, and southward into New Mexico and the Deep South, where Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina all experienced their driest calendar year since reliable records began.\nBy the end of the decade, half of the farming industry in Texas was gone.\nEconomy.\nAs a result of the devastating drought of the 1950s, the number of Texas farms and ranches shrank from 345,000 to 247,000, and the state's rural population declined from more than a third of the population to a quarter. Ranchers and farmers were hit the hardest by the dual threat of water scarcity and the increasing price of feed. The combined income of Texas farmers fell by one-fifth from the previous year, and the price of low-grade beef cattle dropped from 15 to 5 cents a pound. In 1940, 29% of employed Texans worked on a farm. That number fell to 12% in 1960. Crop yields in some areas dropped as much as 50%. Economic losses from 1950 to 1957 were estimated at $22 billion in 2011 dollars.\nTowns suffered from the drought, as well, though it was different from the struggles of farmers. Across Texas, at least 1000 communities enforced some type of water restrictions. Some towns went completely dry and had to transport water in by truck or rail. The city of Dallas' reservoirs ran so low that water had to be pumped from the Red River, whose high salt content caused further trouble by damaging water pipes and plants. Corsicana experienced 82 days of temperatures over , peaking at . \nWest Texas was hit especially hard by the drought, particularly the city of San Angelo, where President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited in 1957 to assess the effects of the drought just before it ended.\nFreeport, Texas, one of the last cities to get its drinking water from the Brazos River before the river reached the sea, opened the first desalination plant in the United States in 1961 with the hope of bringing water security to the region. The first of five plants to test different technologies, Walter L. Badger's Freeport plant used evaporation to separate water from salt, chlorine and other solids. It was applauded by President John F. Kennedy as \"more important than any other scientific enterprise in which this country is now engaged.\"\nEnvironment.\nThe severe drought also had a lasting effect on the Texas environment. Without new grass growth, cattlemen overgrazed their pastures, which damaged the land and made it more susceptible to mesquite and juniper (\"cedar\") intrusion. Poor soil conservation practices left the topsoil vulnerable, and when the drought began, strong winds swept the soil and dust into the sky. This led to persistent dust storms that rivaled those during the Dust Bowl.\nGovernment intervention.\nThe situation became so dire that the US government began distributing emergency feed supplies to desperate farmers. Some farmers resorted to feeding their animals prickly pear or molasses to keep them alive. In 1956, \"The New York Times\" reported that more than 100,000 Texans were receiving surplus \"federal food commodities.\" By the time the drought subsided in 1957, 244 of the 254 counties in Texas were declared federal drought disaster areas.\nOn January 13, 1957, President Eisenhower and Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson visited San Angelo as part of a six-state inspection tour of the drought. There, he made a speech to the people that his administration would do whatever they could to alleviate the hardship of the drought.\nRain returns.\nShortly after the president's visit, rain finally came. Intermittent January rains gave way to downpours in February, which continued through the spring and summer seasons. On April 24, 1957, a storm brought 10 inches of rain on a large portion of Texas within a few hours, accompanied by destructive hail and multiple tornadoes. The rain continued for 32 days, and the floods killed 22 people and forced thousands from their homes. Every major river in Texas flooded, washing out bridges and sweeping away houses. Damages were estimated at $120 million, which still paled in comparison to the damage caused by the drought itself.\nPrevention.\nIn the hope of preventing such a crisis from happening again, the state developed drought contingency plans, expanded the state's water storage and sought new sources of groundwater. The state created the Texas Water Development Board in 1957, which set into motion a number of water-conservation plans. An amendment to the Texas constitution in 1957 authorized the issuance of $200 million in loans to municipalities for conservation and development of water resources. The number of Texas reservoirs more than doubled by 1970, and by 1980, more than 126 major reservoirs had been constructed. State and federal departments of agriculture set up safeguard programs to help farmers handle future severe droughts, including low-interest emergency loans and emergency access to hay and grazing land.\nThe state began a number of efforts to increase water supply, building dams, forming lakes, and tapping into underground sources of water. From 1947 to 1957, groundwater use increased fivefold. As the drought spurred farmers to find more water sources, cheaper pumps were made available. From 1957 to 1970, workers built 69 dams, including Longhorn Dam on the Colorado River, which formed Lady Bird Lake in Austin in 1960. Today, Texas has more surface areas of lake than any state except Minnesota.\nThe 1950s drought remains to be a model for water-conservation plans in the present day, with Texas water authorities using the effects of the drought's severity to create water plans.\nPopular culture.\nThe 1950s Texas drought has been written about by a number of Texans who experienced it, including Elmer Kelton, renowned Western novelist and agricultural journalist, whose novel \"The Time It Never Rained\" is still regarded as the best account of the period.\nThe 1989-93 TV science fiction show, \"Quantum Leap\", in its episode \"A Single Drop of Rain - September 7, 1953\" is set during the Texas drought of 1953. The show's protagonist, Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) leaps into the body of a rainmaker in the con man's hometown. The area is desperate for rain as the crops fail and the cattle die.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

From the beginning of the 11th to the end of the 16th century, on the territory of Russia for every century there were 8 crop failures, which were repeated every 13 years, sometimes causing prolonged famine in a significant territory. The causes of the famine were different, from natural (droughts, crop failures, low rainfall in a certain year) and economic and political crises; for example, the Great Famine of 1931\u20131933, colloquially called the Holodomor, the cause of which was the collectivization policy in the USSR, which affected the territory of the Volga region in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\nPre-1900 droughts and famines.\nIn the 17th century, Russia experienced the famine of 1601\u20131603, as a proportion of the population, believed to be its worst as it may have killed 2 million people (1/3 of the population). Other major famines include the Great Famine of 1315\u201317, which affected much of Europe including part of Russia as well as the Baltic states. The Nikonian chronicle, written between 1127 and 1303, recorded no less than eleven famine years during that period. One of the most serious crises before 1900 was the famine of 1891\u20131892, which killed between 375,000 and 500,000\u00a0people, mainly due to famine-related diseases. Causes included a large Autumn drought resulting in crop failures. Attempts by the government to alleviate the situation generally failed which may have contributed to a lack of faith in the Czarist government and later political instability. In 1899, the Volga area, especially Samara, suffered starvation, typhus and scurvy, which depleted Red Cross aid.\nList of post-1900 droughts and famines.\nThe Golubev and Dronin report gives the following table of the major droughts in Russia between 1900 and 2000. Mass famines were reported in years of drought in the 1920s and 1930s, and the last one occurred in 1984. \n1900s.\nThere was a famine in Russia in 1901-1902 (in which 49 governorates, or gubernias, were impacted) and in 1906-1908 (from 19 to 29 governorates impacted)\n1910s.\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent Russian Civil War, there was a dramatic decline in total agricultural output. Measured in millions of tons, the 1920 grain harvest was only 46.1, compared to 80.1 in 1913. By 1926, it had almost returned to pre-revolutionary levels reaching 76.8.\n1920s.\nThe early 1920s saw a series of famines. The deadly famine in Soviet Russia happened in 1921\u20131923 and was triggered by Lenin's war communism policies) It garnered wide international attention. The most affected area being the Southeastern areas of European Russia (including Volga region, especially national republics of Idel-Ural, see 1921\u201322 famine in Tatarstan) and . An estimated 16 million people may have been affected and up to 5 million died. Fridtjof Nansen was honored with the 1922 Nobel Peace Prize, in part for his work as High Commissioner for Relief In Russia. Other organizations that helped to combat the Soviet famine were International Save the Children Union and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nWhen the Russian famine of 1921\u20131923 broke out, the American Relief Administration's director in Europe, Walter Lyman Brown, began negotiating with Soviet deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maxim Litvinov, in Riga, Latvia. An agreement was reached on August 21, 1921, and an additional implementation agreement was signed by Brown and People's Commisar for Foreign Trade Leonid Krasin on December 30, 1921. The U.S. Congress appropriated $20,000,000 for relief under the Russian Famine Relief Act of late 1921, saving millions of starving Russians.\nAt its peak, the ARA employed 300 Americans, more than 120,000 Russians and fed 10.5 million people daily. Its Russian operations were headed by Col. William N. Haskell. The Medical Division of the ARA functioned from November 1921 to June 1923 and helped overcome the typhus epidemic then ravaging Soviet Russia. The ARA's famine relief operations ran in parallel with much smaller Mennonite, Jewish and Quaker famine relief operations in Russia. The ARA's operations in Russia were shut down on June 15, 1923, after it was discovered that the Soviet Union clandestinely renewed the export of grain to Europe.\nWhile the Moscow government recognized the famine in Russia, Soviet authorities paid no attention to the famine's impact in Ukraine. Moreover, Lenin ordered to move trains full of grain from Ukraine to the Volga region, Moscow, and Petrograd, to combat starvation there. 1,127 trains were sent between fall 1921 and August 1922.\nSoviet famine of 1932\u20131933.\nThe second major Soviet famine happened during the initial push for collectivization during the 30s. Major causes include the 1932\u201333 confiscations of grain and other food by the Soviet authorities which contributed to the famine and affected more than forty million people, especially in the south on the Don and Kuban areas and in Ukraine, where by various estimates\u00a0millions starved to death or died due to famine related illness (the event known as \"Holodomor\"). The famine was perhaps most severe in Kazakhstan where the semi-nomadic pastoralists' traditional way of life was most disturbed by Soviet agricultural ambitions.\nDemographic impact.\nThe demographic impact of the famine of 1932\u20131933 was multifold. In addition to direct and indirect deaths associated with the famine, there were significant internal migrations of Soviet citizens, often fleeing famine-ridden regions. A sudden decline in birthrates permanently \"scarred\" the long-term population growth of the Soviet Union in a way similar to, although not as severe, as that of World War 2.\nEstimates of Soviet deaths attributable to the 1932\u20131933 famine vary wildly, but are typically given in the range of millions. Vallin et al. estimated that the disasters of the decade culminated in a dramatic fall in fertility and a rise in mortality. Their estimates suggest that total losses can be put at about 4.6 million, 0.9 million of which was due to forced migration, 1 million to a deficit in births, and 2.6 million to exceptional mortality. The long-term demographic consequences of collectivization and the Second World War meant that the Soviet Union's 1989 population was 288 million rather than 315 million, 9% lower than it otherwise would have been. In addition to the deaths, the famine resulted in massive population movements, as about 300,000 Kazakh nomads fled to China, Iran, Mongolia and Afghanistan during the famine. A 2020 \"Journal of Genocide Research\" article by Oleh Wolowyna estimated 8.7 million deaths across the entire Soviet Union including 3.9 million in Ukraine, 3.3 million in Russia, and 1.3 million in Kazakhstan, plus a lower number of dead in other republics.\nAlthough famines were taking place in various parts of the USSR in 1932\u20131933, for example in Kazakhstan, parts of Russia and the Volga German Republic, the name \"Holodomor\" is specifically applied to the events that took place in territories populated by Ukrainians and also North Caucasian Kazakhs.\nLegacy.\nThe legacy of Holodomor remains a sensitive and controversial issue in contemporary Ukraine where it is regarded as an act of genocide by the government and is generally remembered as one of the greatest tragedies in the nation's history. The issue of Holodomor being an intentional act of genocide or not has often been a subject of dispute between the Russian Federation and Ukrainian government. The modern Russian government has generally attempted to disassociate and downplay any links between itself and the famine.\nThere is still debate over whether or not Holodomor was a massive failure of policy or a deliberate act of genocide. Robert Conquest held the view that the famine was not intentionally inflicted by Stalin, but \"with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put \u201cSoviet interest\u201d other than feeding the starving first\u2014thus consciously abetting it\". Michael Ellman's analysis of the famine found that \"there is some evidence that in 1930-33 ... Stalin also used starvation in his war against the peasants\", which he calls a \"conscious policy of starvation\", but concludes that there were several factors, primarily focusing on the leadership's culpability in continuing to prioritize collectivization and industrialization over preventing mass death, due to their Leninist stance of regarding starvation \"as a necessary cost of the progressive policies of industrialisation and the building of socialism\", and thus did not \"perceive the famine as a humanitarian catastrophe requiring a major effort to relieve distress and hence made only limited relief efforts.\"\n1940s.\nDuring the Siege of Leningrad in Russia by Nazi Germany, as many as one million people died while many more went hungry or starved but survived. Germans tried to starve out Leningrad in order to break its resistance. Starvation was one of the primary causes of death as the food supply was cut off and strict rationing was enforced. Animals in the city were slaughtered and eaten. Instances of cannibalism were reported.\nThe last major famine in the USSR happened mainly in 1947 as a cumulative effect of consequences of collectivization, war damage, the severe drought in 1946 in over 50 percent of the grain-productive zone of the country and government social policy and mismanagement of grain reserves. The regions primarily affected were Moldova and . In Ukraine, between 100,000 and one million people may have perished. In Moldova, according to Soviet officials, the famine claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people, while historians estimate that this figure reaches at least 250,000\u2013300,000 people.\n1947\u20131991.\nAfter 1947 there were no known famines. The drought of 1963 caused panic slaughtering of livestock, but there was no risk of famine. After that year the Soviet Union started importing feed grains for its livestock in increasing amounts.\nPost-Soviet Russia.\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been occasional issues with hunger and food insecurity in Russia. Both Russia and Ukraine were subject to a series of severe droughts from July 2010 to 2015. The 2010 drought saw wheat production fall by 20% in Russia and subsequently resulted in a temporary ban on grain exports.", "matches": ["droughts"], "label": []}

The drought has been referred to as the worst in a century in southwestern China.\nCauses.\nPrior to the drought in Yunnan and Guizhou, the China Meteorological Administration recorded temperatures averaging 2\u00a0\u00b0C warmer than normal over six months and half the average precipitation for the past year across the region, both unprecedented since at least the 1950s. The effects of El Ni\u00f1o are believed to be contributing to the drought, which may be exacerbated by global warming, as some areas in Yunnan have recorded record high temperatures during the winter since record-keeping began in 1950. Some areas in the drought-affected regions have seen no rainfall since before October. Spring dust storms are common in China, but have become more severe in recent years due to desertification, deforestation, drought, urban sprawl and overgrazing. Countries downstream from Yunnan are also affected by drought conditions upriver, and some places including much of Vietnam have seen very little precipitation since the previous September.\nA severe drought in 2009 also affected much of northern and northeast China, resulting in agricultural losses of up to 50%.\nWater shortages.\nBy March 22, 2010, about 51 million people faced water shortages in a number of provinces. Commodities including sugar cane, flowers, tea, fruit, potatoes, rapeseed, medicinal ingredients, tobacco, wheat, rubber and coffee have been severely affected with output reduced by as much as 50%. Authorities began to fear unrest due to soaring food prices and sent more than 10,000 armed police to the affected regions to ensure stability and help with water supplies. The three wells in the village of Xiazha in Guangxi Autonomous Region were reported to have gone completely dry for the first time since 1517, in addition to three reservoirs in the area going dry. Economic damage to agriculture and failed electricity generation from hydroelectric dams from the drought was estimated to be at least 24 billion Chinese yuan ($3.5 billion USD). Around 3,600 rivers and brooks in Guizhou have run dry, while 916,000 ha of crops were affected by drought in the province and one million farmers have left to find work in other provinces. The drought affected over 28 million farmers, and a grain shortage has affected 8 million people. The Chinese government has transferred 1.7 million tonnes of grain to the region to reduce potential inflation. About 4.348 million ha of cropland were affected by the drought in Southwestern China and 942,000 ha would yield no harvest by late March, according to China's State Commission of Disaster Relief. In late March, the government began cloud seeding in Guizhou using silver iodide to produce rain. By April 10, the drought had eased in Chongqing due to heavy rain, but it had affected over 18 million livestock and 8.13 million ha of land. In parts of Yunnan Province inhabited by the Dai people, officials cancelled or shortened the Songkran water dousing festival due to the water shortage, including in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture. By early June, the drought had affected close to 5 million hectares of land.\nThe drought may also affect water levels at the headwaters of the Yangtze, Mekong and Salween Rivers. Countries downstream of the Mekong, including Thailand, suggested that the building of dams on the river such as at Lancang may be worsening the effects of drought on the river's water levels, which were at their lowest in 20 years. Fisheries along the Mekong in Thailand have halted, and 7.9 million people in the country are affected by the drought. 3,674 small dams within the river basin have dried up.\nThe drought in Vietnam was described as the country's worst in a century. The Red River near Hanoi was by early March at a level of , the lowest on record, and rice plantations have been severely affected. Timber fires have been sparked in several regions. The Mekong Delta experienced its lowest water levels in nearly 20 years, threatening to produce saltwater intrusion in dry areas. Some parts of Vietnam are forecast to possibly receive no rain until August. A power shortage of up to one billion kilowatt-hours could also hit the country as less water is available for hydroelectricity.\nThe El Ni\u00f1o conditions of the winter prior to the drought has raised concerns that the rice crop in Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines may be significantly reduced by the summer.\nThe lack of precipitation caused land subsidence at Kunming Wujiaba International Airport in Yunnan.\nAbout 5,000 villagers in Yunnan Province have left their homes from the drought for streams near Himalayan foothills, and many residents in Guangxi who are able to leave have also left. However, officials have denied reports of drought refugees leaving their villages. The source of the Pearl River's headwaters was cut off, and its outflow was severely reduced. Water rationing was put into practice in some rural regions.\nShortages of drinking water also affected parts of Inner Mongolia, including a water shortage for over 250,000 residents of Chifeng. Reservoirs in the city held 73.7% less water than they did one year prior and water volume had reduced by 77.4% in major rivers in the area by mid-April.\nThe drought has affected non-ferrous metal production in Guangxi, including of electrolytic zinc, with companies in Nandan County cutting production by 30%.\nPremier Wen Jiabao visited southwestern China three times during the drought, including a three-day tour in mid-March in Yunnan, including Luliang County, which had seen no rainfall since August, to promote water conservation, and another visit in early April 2010 to several Miao and Buyei autonomous prefectures in Guizhou, some of the worst-hit places where farming has been made impossible.\nMost provinces in South China affected by the drought were hit by a series of floods beginning in mid-May that ended most of the drought but also destroyed large areas of farmland.\nDust storms.\nStrong dust storms from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia hit Xinjiang Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, North Korea and Japan by March 22, before being carried across the Pacific Ocean by the jet stream, with some dust reaching the West Coast of the United States. The dust storm in late March spiralled around a strong low pressure system. Many areas recorded an extremely rare level 5 \"hazardous\" rating for air quality. Many flights in Beijing were also delayed or cancelled. Air pollution readings in Hong Kong reached a record high, reaching at least 15 times the recommended maximum levels by the World Health Organization. Taiwan also reported a new record for worst sandstorm conditions.\nA strong sandstorm tore through Turpan in Xinjiang on April 23, sparking fires that killed two people and forcing a shutdown of rail and road traffic for six hours.\nRelief.\nOxfam Hong Kong provided water in Yunnan. A major fundraiser was also held that raised 280 million yuan. Many celebrities took part including Wang Feng, Elva Hsiao, Andy Lau, He Jie, Jackie Chan, , Yan Weiwen, Zhou Xiao'ou (), Bibi Zhou, and Yang Zi. The Hong Kong government also approved a HK$1.4 million grant.\nMany donations of bottled water have also arrived in Guizhou and other parts of southwestern China from around the country.\nAlgal blooms.\nIn mid-June 2010, a large algal bloom, consisting of \"enteromorpha\" algae, developed off the coast of Shandong, in the Yellow Sea. Causes of the algal outbreak include marine pollution from sewage and agricultural run-off, in addition to run-off from fish farms, worsened by eutrophication following the drought, subsequent flooding and heat wave, as well as high sea surface temperatures in the area. The bloom continues to expand, and preparations have been made for a flotilla of vessels to ward off the bloom, covering an area of , the largest bloom since 2008. The patch of algae since expanded offshore Jiangsu Province, and is pushing toward the city of Qingdao. The Chinese State Oceanic Administration has warned that the algae could threaten marine life and local tourism, and other scientists have stated that the bloom could decompose on beaches and release toxic gases if not cleaned up. Close to 4,000 tonnes a day of algae is being removed from the bloom, to be sent off and used as animal feed or fertilizer. Green and red tides have become more common in China in recent years. The green tides from the current algal blooms can also result in dead zones from localized ocean anoxia. Large blooms of jellyfish, including giant Nomura's jellyfish have also appeared off Shandong and around the coasts of Japan within the past decade, as a result of the same type of pollution in dead zones.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

The drought was one of the worst in the region's history and led the South African government to declare the region a \"disaster area\" in October 2019. \nA local hydrologist, Gideon Groenewald, has stated that it could be the worst drought the area as experienced in one thousand years and has had serious negative socioeconomic impacts on the region. Heavy rains in 2019 were not enough to break the drought. Reasons cited for the severity of the drought include poor water management by local government, unpredictable rainfall patterns, and vandalism of local infrastructure. Areas of the Eastern Cape that overlap with the Karoo, such as the area around Graaff-Reinet, have been especially badly hit. The drought has caused projected financial losses of R6.4 billion in livestock production, with extensive livestock areas accounting for some 5,600 jobs.

It estimates the millimeters of rain needed to fill the soil with water (Mount 1972, 1980). The term was coined by Mount to focus attention on how useful a reliable measure of soil dryness is for flood and fire forecasting and management. Tasmanian government departments, businesses and land managers have used the SDI for these purposes for over 50 years and it is published daily by the Tasmanian Fire Service. Other states in Australia also make use of the SDI.\nThe model uses a water budget approach and assumes relatively simple mechanisms for the wetting and drying stages (Figure 1, Figure 2)\nFor the wetting stage, the rain falling on water, such as rivers and lakes, and marsh soils bypasses normal forest soils and produces flash run-off (FR). Some other rain is intercepted by and dried from forest canopies (I).\u00a0The amount of rainfall going to flash run-off and canopy interception are taken off the daily rain gauge reading (P), to estimate how much rain reaches and wets forest soils.\u00a0 The model assumes each 150 mm of a typical meter-deep soil holds about 25 mm of rain. Run-off from full soils (SDI=0) is soil capacity overflow (SCO).\nFor the drying stage, both evaporation (E) from the soil and transpiration (T) through the plants are controlled by daily maximum temperature at five reducing rates (Keetch and Byram 1968; Mount 1972; Langford, Duncan and Heeps 1977; Burrows 1987). \nApplication of the Soil Dryness index.\nThe Tasmanian SDI has five soil drying stages that relate to forest dryness and flammability.

Droughts are forecast to occur more frequently due to climate change, and 2023 began with drought. Most water loss is due to poor irrigation. In 2022 the World Bank said that \u201cwithout reform, a 10% fall in water supply in T\u00fcrkiye could reduce GDP by 6%\u201d.\nClimate.\nWeather patterns.\nMost of the climate of Turkey in the interior is a semi-arid climate and on the south and west coasts a Mediterranean climate which are characterized by summer drought. Turkey's climate is affected by the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the Mediterranean Circulation Index, and the Southern Oscillation Index.\nClimate change.\nDue to climate change, extreme droughts and water scarcity are predicted to increase, for example in Ankara Province.\nGeography.\nParts of the country are arid or becoming arid. Between 1931 and 2010 extreme drought occurred in 3% of the country, severe drought in 4% and moderate drought in 7%. The lowest precipitation in Turkey is around Lake Tuz at around 35\u00a0cm per year.\nMajor droughts.\nSevere droughts were experienced in 1804, 1876, 1928, and often since the 1970s.\nRecent severe droughts.\n2007\u20132008.\nBetween December 2006 and December 2008 there was significantly less winter and autumn precipitation. Hydrological, agricultural and socioeconomic droughts developed due to the meteorological drought. Loss of agricultural products, insufficiency of above ground and underground water, insufficiency and cuts in drinking water in big cities such as Ankara and Istanbul were observed. The drought mostly affected the Aegean, Marmara, Mediterranean and Central Anatolia regions. Drinking water was supplied from the K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River to Ankara and from Melen Stream to Istanbul.\n2013\u20132014.\nThe 2012 Eastern and Central Anatolia drought combined with the summer drought of the Mediterranean Climate, was experienced as a moderate and severe drought in most of the country in 2013. The total amount of precipitation between 1 October 2013 and 17 January 2014 was about half of the same period in the previous year and 37% below the long-term average.\n2020\u20132021.\nPrecipitation was below average from mid-2019, and particularly the second half of 2020, and the drought mainly impacted agriculture in Turkey, because big city reservoirs received rain before they ran out.\nDesertification risk.\nMore than 60% (51.5 mil. ha) of environmentally sensitive areas are fragile and critical.\nAgriculture.\nGrain in Konya Province is affected Almost three-quarters of the water supply is used for irrigation and most water loss is due to poor irrigation, and more widespread use of drip irrigation has been suggested.\nWater resources.\nThere are about 1500 cubic meters per person per year.

Precipitation can be measured by satellite.\nOther uses of water.\nHydroelectricity in Turkey is reduced by climate change. According to the Water Policy Association half of water intended for taps is lost to leaks. According to TEMA 4 million tons a day are consumed for coal mining.\nOfficially sanctioned methods to combat drought include better protecting river basins, building underground dams, rainwater harvesting, use of grey water and praying for rain.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Dry conditions gradually became established during the late 1890s and several dry areas joined together to create the end result of a drought covering more than half the continent.\nBeginnings.\nExcept for a widespread El Nino drought in 1888, the late 1880s and early 1890s were a period of extremely heavy rainfall over New South Wales, Queensland and to a lesser extent Victoria and the settled areas of Tasmania and South Australia. Lake Eyre is believed to have filled with water from Cooper Creek in 1886/1887, 1889/1890 and 1894.\nThe wet spell of the early 1890s ended earliest in the area between Melbourne and Sydney, where rainfall in 1894 was below normal even as much of inland Queensland and New South Wales had one of their wettest years on record. A very hot November with temperatures reaching made the situation critical in some areas. Though Sydney had heavy rainfall in January and February 1895, from March that year drought began spreading widely across New South Wales and Victoria. The winter that year was the driest on record in Sydney, and despite a relieving fall during September, Sydney's rainfall for the period March to December was the third-lowest on record. The winter was dominated by very strong westerly winds to quite low latitudes and was very wet in southwestern Australia and wet in the Adelaide region and Western District of Victoria, but only about average in the drier areas further inland. Over all of Victoria and South Australia, however, extremely dry weather in October and November was sufficient to cause the failure of many wheat crops, whilst in East Gippsland these months saw unprecedented rainless spells.\n1895.\nThese years began with a hot spell and numerous bushfires especially in Gippsland, which had suffered two years of deficient rainfall. Despite a very powerful monsoon in the north, heavy rains therefrom during February only broke the drought temporarily, as El Ni\u00f1o developed later that year. Despite El Ni\u00f1o, drought-stricken Gippsland has one of its wettest winters on record as a series of storms produced torrential rains between Melbourne and Sydney\u2014and around Hobart\u2014in June and again in August. Early in September, huge floods occurred on East Gippsland streams as Orbost received in three days, but inland Victoria and New South Wales had been dry ever since May and the rest of September and October were almost completely dry, leading to another wheat crop failure.\nNovember was very wet in northern New South Wales, but still dry further south, whilst in the settled areas of South Australia dry conditions had been much worse, with no above-average rainfall since April.\n1897.\nThis year began with cool, moist summer weather in most of Victoria and New South Wales, but conditions in Queensland, which had continued to have heavy rain during the \"wet\" season in 1895 and 1896 became drier. In inland districts the first transition to drought began as February and March were distinctly dry.\nApril was particularly dry despite the breakdown of El Ni\u00f1o, as was May except in Gippsland, but June and July were very wet over inland New South Wales and northern Victoria (it was the wettest winter on record at some stations such as Nyngan and Echuca). August saw good rains shift to South Australia and coastal Victoria, but despite continued good rains in September and October over inland New South Wales water supplies did not really recover owing to a very dry November and a hot December in inland regions, which saw temperatures again reach in many parts of Victoria and not much less in Tasmania, where rainfall had again been deficient throughout the winter. Heavy rains on the North Coast of New South Wales were of little use to an agricultural sector that was seeing many inland properties demonstrably overstocked based on expectations of higher rainfall than was falling.\n1898.\nThe heatwave conditions during December 1897 continued early this year as Melbourne set a still-standing record mean maximum for February of . The northeast of New South Wales was deluged by moist easterly winds and a low-pressure system that moved over inland Victoria with valuable rain later gave the South Coast some of the heaviest rainfall ever known in Australia: Bega had in five days, or more rainfall than it has received in two-fifths of all complete years.\nHowever, despite continued heavy rain and flooding in Queensland and the North Coast of New South Wales in March, extremely dry conditions were established over all the rest of southeastern Australia and good rains in South Australia during April and May had little effect inland despite producing heavy rain in Gippsland - which had been rainless since the beginning of the year apart from its February deluge.\nAlthough a weak La Ni\u00f1a began developing and June was very wet over most of South Australia and inland Victoria, it was still dry in Tasmania and southern Victoria, and July was dry generally except in Tasmania and the southeast of South Australia. August, though wet in southwestern Australia and the west of New South Wales, was extremely dry in the worst-hit areas of southern Victoria, whilst useful September rains did little to ameliorate the situation there. November was very dry except in Tasmania and South Gippsland, and December even worse except in areas of the Mallee affected by thunderstorms.\nDespite 1898 being wet over most of Queensland, it was very dry in the northwestern slopes of New South Wales and much of southern Victoria. in Melbourne, 1898 was the driest year until 1967, and in Orbost it is still the third-driest year on record.\n1899.\nThis year saw southern Victoria and Tasmania have heavy rains in January, as did Queensland, whilst February and March - though dry in New South Wales - again saw good rains there as cold fronts linked with tropical moisture. March and April saw heavy rains in southern Victoria continue, but these months were still dry in inland New South Wales and Queensland.\nWith El Ni\u00f1o returning, however, May was very dry in most inland districts, but June was\u2014welcomingly as it turned out\u2014extremely wet in Victoria and northeastern South Australia. July, however, saw some of the coldest conditions on record in the grain country: in Melbourne, the mean minimum temperature of is the lowest on record and in many places sub-zero minima were general on most days during July and August. Adelaide had its driest July on record with a total of only .\nThe anticyclonic conditions, however, created a strong onshore flow that gave the cost of New South Wales almost continuous heavy rain: in Sydney the winter of 1899 was the second-wettest on record. Major flooding occurred on most coastal rivers.\nDry conditions continued throughout the rest of the year except on the coast of New South Wales, and only the heavy June falls prevented grain crops being a total failure. By the end of 1899, El Ni\u00f1o was already producing a very poor northern monsoon, and apart from the southeast December was unusually dry throughout Queensland, and also the Top End and Kimberley.\n1900.\nThe early part of this year saw one of the most complete monsoon failures in the north of Australia, especially in normally wet Cape York Peninsula where the year proved the driest on record at many stations. In February, a major heatwave and dust storms hit southeastern Australia.\nAlthough the monsoon did not return in the north, March saw the beginning of a very wet period in Victoria, South Australia, and most of Western Australia as northwest cloudbands generated repeated heavy rain. With the associated troughs developing into low pressure systems in the Tasman Sea, Melbourne and most of South Gippsland had their wettest autumn on record. On 17 May, the Yarra River was flooded and a few days later the torrential rain extended to Sydney and the south coast of New South Wales, which saw further heavy rain in June and July - in the latter case after most unseasonable rain had hit tropical northwestern Australia. In the process snow fell to low levels in New South Wales.\nTasmania and Queensland remained very dry as a result of missing the heavy autumn falls, and after some heavy rain in August over the settled areas of South Australia and southwestern Western Australia, dry conditions returned to the continent in a fashion more decisive than at any earlier stage of the drought. Almost the whole continent apart from the southeast of Western Australia was below average for the September to December period, with October being the third-driest on record in Brisbane. A promising season for the wheat and pastoral industries thus became mediocre at best.\n1901.\nThe monsoon in Queensland was again very poor apart from the Wet Tropics and Cape York, and in February an extremely active and vigorous monsoon low over inland South Australia brought further east not rain but a disastrous heatwave with Melbourne reporting its hottest February temperature () until 1983.\nMarch was wet over northwestern Queensland, the Moreton region, South Gippsland and Tasmania, but the rains did not extend into the dry reaches of the continent. Then, despite a torrential downpour ( in three days at Melbourne) producing another big Yarra flood in April, May to July was generally dry apart from June in southern coastal areas and the settled parts of South Australia, besides which June was also very cold. During July, a huge cold outbreak produced record low maximum temperatures at many places. Snow astonishingly fell as far north as Winton and at Daylesford the temperature on 26 July never rose above .\nA record wet August over New South Wales and adjacent areas of Queensland and Victoria proved no more than a temporary respite. Very dry conditions set in during September over New South Wales, again affecting crop yields severely, and despite the first half of spring being distinctly wet over Victoria and Tasmania and these rains extending as far north as the Eyre Peninsula and Condobolin, November and December were exceedingly dry - sixth-driest and second-driest averaged over Australia since 1900.\n1902.\nAlthough dry conditions had been a feature over significant parts of the continent since 1894, it was only this year that large-scale drought began to become genuinely disastrous.\nJanuary and February were wet over Tasmania, but distinctly dry further north, and despite a heavy storm over southern Victoria and the settled areas of South Australia, March continued the trend of complete summer rainfall failure in New South Wales and Queensland. Most areas of those two states had their lowest rainfall for the November to March period on record, and April was even worse\u2014being \"averaged over Australia, the driest month of the twentieth century\", with a rainfall of only . Sheep and cattle over the inland pastoral districts were already starving, and so extensive was the drought that agistment was not available in any place to which transport could be arranged. The result was that sheep died in numbers that have never been equalled before or since: some sources estimate that \"half\" the sheep population was lost in the drought.\nAlthough in southwestern Australia\u2014often looked upon as a \"saviour\" when the rains fail further east\u2014the rainy season began on time in May, the dry weather continued without a break in the eastern states. Then, despite June being quite wet in southern Victoria, Tasmania and even parts of South Australia, the month's rain was associated with cold outbreaks that produced extremely severe frosts and several cases of low-level snowfalls. Oatlands recorded a temperature as low as during one of these outbreaks, and snow fell in Hobart. Worse still, northern New South Wales and southern Queensland remained as dry as ever, and southwestern Australia was very dry.\nDespite torrential rains in July around Eden and heavy rains in the far southwest of Western Australia, rainless or near-rainless conditions continued elsewhere with extremely severe frosts. August was the driest-ever winter month in Perth with only , and Melbourne, equally dry, set a record for lowest mean August minimum temperature at broken only in 1943 and 1944.\nThough September was wet over southern Western Australia and a single heavy storm produced above-average rainfall in eastern Tasmania and southern Victoria, and October saw very heavy coastal rains in New South Wales (Sydney's on the 13th is still its wettest-ever October day), unrelenting dryness inland combined with hot northerly winds saw one of the worst dust storms ever hit Melbourne on 12 November. Any hope for the wheat crop had gone as early as the end of August, and yields were close to the worst ever.\nAlthough November 1902 later proved a very wet month in a band of country between about Southern Cross and Jundah, it was still very dry in more coastal areas.\nAftermath.\nDecember 1902 proved the first month since 1898 when most of the continent had heavy rain. Indeed, in southwestern Victoria many stations had their highest daily rainfall on record, resulting in flash flooding. Only the Kimberley, the North Coast of New South Wales and Western Tasmania remained below average.\nThe remainder of the 1902/1903 summer was disappointing and the monsoon generally weak (though parts of Queensland had heavy falls from cyclones) but from March onwards 1903 proved a generally wet year apart from coastal areas of New South Wales and East Gippsland. Cereal crops, which had constantly failed due to frost and lack of spring rainfall, were exceptionally good due to a wet September throughout southern Australia apart from Tasmania and the Western District. It was in these critical spring months where the rainfall deficiencies of the Federation Drought were concentrated, and the return of the spring rains was followed by a strong monsoon over tropical Australia: at Cooktown and Kojonup 1903 is the wettest calendar year on record.\nOverall for eastern states 1903 came out as the wettest year since 1894, even if its rainfalls were distinctly short of the high marks of the early 1890s except over western Victoria and parts of South Australia.\nIn East Gippsland and coastal regions of New South Wales the entire decade between 1901 and 1910 was consistently dry: Sydney did not exceed its long-term mean rainfall once, and Brisbane did so only twice between 1899 and 1915.\nOther parts of eastern Australia, even with a significant improvement over falls between 1895 and 1902, rarely saw rainfall during the 1900s and 1910s nearly so heavy as during the early 1890s. Climatologists today frequently view the Federation Drought as a major climate shift across eastern Australia from the wet period of the nineteenth century to a dry spell lasting until the mid-1940s. This is supported by many hydrological records, such as that of Lake George near Canberra and many coastal rivers in South Wales.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

It was released on 5 October 2018 by Berlin-based record label, PAN. The first and only single from the album, \"Red Desert,\" was released in August 2018.\nBackground and music.\nThe music on \"The Drought\" was described as noise and industrial music and incorporates soundtrack dynamics. According to Pitchfork's Daniel Martin-McCormick, the album, while rooted in industrial and power electronics genres, eschews these genres' \"stereotypical displays of machismo and fetishistic celebrations of strength.\" Similarly, Bob Cluness of The Quietus stated that \"uses genre motifs of noise and industrial music not so much to bombard the listener with adolescent fantasies of power, transgression and provocation, but instead to look at such violence as possessing empathy based on action and transformation.\" \nHoffmeier has stated that during the recording sessions for \"The Drought\", she exerted a particular emphasis on the sound editing process. According to the press release, the record \"demonstrates an intention to expand on the vocabulary of confrontational music and into a grander narrative defined by technical and emotional growth.\" Hoffmeier has cited the works of Charles Baudelaire and Jean Genet as influences on the album.\nThe cover art was created by Norwegian photographer Torbj\u00f8rn R\u00f8dland in 2006. The track \"Red Desert\" was named after the 1964 film of the same name by Michelangelo Antonioni.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Drought\" has received generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 81 based on 5 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" \"Exclaim!\" critic Tom Beedham has described the record as a \"thoroughly traumatizing noise horror,\" and further stated that \"it's hard to imagine a more terrifying album to come this year.\" Daniel Martin-McCormick of Pitchfork thought that Hoffmeier's voice \"brings \"The Drought\" together, giving the album a sense of movement and purpose beyond a set of well-executed mood pieces.\" Martin-McCormick additionally considered the record as a \"cinematic take on noise.\"\nResident Advisor's Marc Masters wrote that \"The Drought\" \"deftly navigates unpredictable freedom and domineering control,\" regarding the it to \"be compelling because Hoffmeier is so clearly in charge.\" Writing for The Quietus, Bob Cluness described the record as \"her strongest album to date and one where \u201cnoise\u201d is but a tool towards a much more expansive expression of music.\"", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Similar conditions started in other states in August 2020, including Iowa, Nebraska and certain parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota. At the same time, more than 90% of Utah, Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico were in some levels of drought. Also in drought conditions were Wyoming, Oregon and Arizona.\nOver the course of 2021, conditions improved in the Northeast but worsened in the Western United States. As of June 2021, \"nearly the entire region (97 percent) [was] facing abnormally dry conditions.\" Drought also affected a wide area of Mexico in 2021, as well as the prairies of Canada. \nThe drought conditions of 2020 were associated with a moderate La Ni\u00f1a episode that had developed in the Pacific Ocean.\nUnited States.\nWest.\nBy autumn 2020, the drought in the Western States was the worst since similar drought conditions seven years earlier.\nThe 2020\u20132021 drought was described by some as possibly the worst drought in modern history for the Western U.S.\nBy late spring 2021, dry conditions had expanded to almost the entire state of California and to neighboring Nevada.\nIn July 2021, after two more extremely dry winters, Lake Powell dropped to its lowest level since 1969 when the reservoir was first filling. Lake Mead fell to a level expected to trigger federally mandated cuts to Arizona and Nevada's water supplies for the first time in history.\nThe first quarter of 2022 was the driest on record in California and Nevada. Despite June having slightly above average precipitation in California, the state still had its driest first half. This persisted even during the extreme monsoon season, but eased a bit. Since July 28, 2022, Lake Mead rose 1%. \nDespite the monsoon, Southern California was put in a drought emergency in December 2022, allowing for water restrictions to be put in place. \n2022\u20132023 California floods.\nThe flooding in late December 2022 and early January 2023 alleviated some of the drought conditions by January 3. By March 16, all exceptional and extreme drought was washed out of California. In mid April, the Governor announced the state would meet 100% of requested water allocations for the first time since 2006. It is estimated that there is more water in the California snow pack in April of 2023 than the total capacity of Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservior.\nMidwest.\nIowa received widespread rain in September; that improved the dry conditions for the eastern region of the state. But the western half of the state dealt with severe-to-extreme drought problems which extended past 2020 and into 2021. By late April and early May 2021, though, northern, central and northeastern Iowa had fallen back into dry conditions. By mid-August 2021, drought problems in Iowa had worsened; certain areas across the state were affected with extreme drought conditions by August 13. The northwest and east-central regions of Iowa were especially adversely affected with extreme dry conditions by mid-August.\nThe 2020\u20132022 droughts were also affecting Michigan, southern Wisconsin, most of North Dakota and northwestern South Dakota.\nIn northeastern Illinois near the Chicago metropolitan area, May 2021 was the driest since 2012. As of June 1, 2021, Chicago had only received barely half of one inch of rainfall due to drought in the area. April 2021 was one of the city's driest Aprils on record; only fell in Chicago in April 2021.\nBy August 12, 2021, Minnesota was having the worst drought spells since the major drought in the final two years of the late 1980s. Just over seven percent of the state, in particular, nine counties in the northwestern part of Minnesota were having exceptional drought. That was the first time since 1988 the state had been under exceptional dry conditions. The drought conditions in Minnesota during 2021 caused serious comparisons to extremely similar dry conditions eighty-five years prior.\nDrought significantly expanded in Minnesota in September 2022, which became the driest on record at the Twin Cities.\nNortheast.\nBy late August/early September 2020, the drought conditions in several regions of the United States had worsened. The New England states were also under severe to extreme drought conditions. 2020 became the driest summer on record in Hartford, Connecticut. The abnormally dry summer across the Northeast led to 99% of Rhode Island being in extreme drought by September.\nThe Northeastern United States were out of drought conditions by the beginning of June 2021. However, throughout July 2022, drought returned and intensified across the Northeast. Newark, New Jersey had their driest July on record in 2022. Massachusetts was hit particularly hard, as by August 16, over 40% of the state was in extreme drought. Almost all of Rhode Island was in extreme drought in mid-August, after the 3rd driest July on record. August was the driest in New York City since 1994. August became the 6th driest on record at JFK International Airport, 4th driest on record at Islip, New York and 3rd driest on record in Bridgeport, Connecticut. However, drought improved in September. By September 27, no part of Maine was in severe drought, and most of the state was out of drought. With precipitation increasing in the fall, especially after Hurricane Nicole, less than 10% of the Northeast was in any kind of drought. However, portions of Long Island, the Hudson Valley and Massachusetts remained in drought as of January 24, 2023, with moderate drought confined to portions of the south shore of the island.\nSoutheast.\nBy June 2021, moderate drought conditions had developed in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. Drought in North Carolina peaked in early December 2021.\nMexico.\nAs of April 2021, Mexico was facing one of the most widespread droughts in its history, with 85% of the country experiencing drought conditions.\nAs of March/April 2022, 30% of Mexico, especially northern, still has serious, critical and major drought problems.\nCanada.\nAs of spring 2021, extreme drought threatened the southern corners of Manitoba and Saskatchewan after an abnormally dry fall and winter.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

On 9 August, a senior European Commission researcher said it seems to be Europe's worst year in 500 years. A report from the Global Drought Observatory has confirmed this. The drought had serious consequences for hydropower generation and the cooling systems of nuclear power plants, as the drought reduced the amount of river water available for cooling. Agriculture in Europe was also negatively affected by the drought.\nFrance.\nMuch of France experienced a drought. In early August, two-thirds of the country was at crisis alert. It has reportedly been caused by the historic heatwaves that have hit the country. July was reportedly the driest month in France for 60 years. By August, 100 villages had run out of drinking water. Water use was restricted in nearly all metropolitan departments of France. The Prime Minister of France \u00c9lisabeth Borne has called it \"the country's worst drought in history\". On 5 August, she announced the creation of an inter-ministerial crisis unit.\nThe national corn harvest was expected to be 18.5% lower than 2021. Milk shortages are expected to follow. Conversely, salt farms have benefited from the hot temperatures.\nIn July and August Gironde experienced numerous wild fires, see 2022 European and Mediterranean wildfires.\nGermany.\nAs of August 2022, the River Rhine's water level had fallen so much that shipping was affected. The water level in Emmerich sunk to -3\u00a0cm, being 10\u00a0cm lower than the previous record from 2018. The normal water level is 239\u00a0cm. Due to the low water levels, the cost of transporting goods multiplied because ships were only able to load 25-35% of their usual freight.\nOn 24 August, 54% of the German area was affected by an extraordinary drought. Further 24.6% by an extreme and further 12.2% by a severe drought.\nMany districts and states banned water extraction from creeks, rivers and lakes, the watering of lawns, filling of pools or cleaning cars.\nBy mid August, the number of forest fires in the state of Brandenburg was three times as high than in all of 2021.\nItaly.\nA state of emergency was declared in July 2022.

The wrecks are still laden with ammunition and explosives, and present a safety hazard.\nSpain and Portugal.\nThe Iberian Peninsula experienced a drought. Water shortages were prevalent in Spain, leading to rationing. Portugal has also declared a drought crisis.\nUnited Kingdom.\nJuly 2022 was the driest July in England since 1935. According to Sky News, in one in seven counties, it was the driest July since records began in 1836. As a result, hosepipe bans were introduced in some parts of South East England.\nFields and heathland dried up. On 12 August, a hosepipe ban came into force by South East Water. Drought-like conditions also affected South West England.\nOn 12 August, a drought was declared in eight of the 14 Environment Agency areas: Devon and Cornwall, Solent and South Downs, Kent and South London, Herts and North London, East Anglia, Thames, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, and the East Midlands. Electricity supplies are reportedly threatened. Reservoir levels are at a 25-year low. A drought was declared in the West Midlands region on 23 August, with the Environment Agency warning it had been using groundwater resources and reserves from reservoirs in Wales to help maintain the flows of the River Severn, which supplies six million people in the area.\nOn 15 August, a hosepipe ban was introduced in Cornwall for the first time in 26 years. On 18 August, a hosepipe ban in South West Wales was introduced affecting Pembrokeshire and parts of Carmarthenshire.\n D\u0175r Cymru Welsh Water said that it would be likely to last into September. Hosepipe bans were also declared by Thames Water. On 19 August, a drought was declared in north Ceredigion, Teifi, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthen, Swansea, Llanelli, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend. The River Black Bourn in Suffolk is reportedly \"near dead\".\nOn 30 August, a drought was declared in South West England, covering Bristol, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Dorset and parts of Wiltshire.\nParts of Yorkshire experienced their driest period on record and emergency pipes were laid. In December 2022, Yorkshire Water lifted the hosepipe ban after three months.\nThe Cornwall hosepipe ban continued to be active into 2023, and was extended to cover large parts of Devon on 25 April 2023.

{"id": "2438696", "revid": "1152788828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2438696", "title": "Sahel drought", "text": "The Sahel region of Africa has long experienced a series of historic droughts, dating back to at least the 17th century. The Sahel region is a climate zone sandwiched between the Sudanian Savanna to the south and the Sahara desert to the north, across West and Central Africa. While the frequency of drought in the region is thought to have increased from the end of the 19th century, three long droughts have had dramatic environmental and societal effects upon the Sahel nations. Famine followed severe droughts in the 1910s, the 1940s, and the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, although a partial recovery occurred from 1975-80. The most recent drought occurred in 2012.\nWhile at least one particularly severe drought has been confirmed each century since the 17th century, the frequency and severity of recent Sahelian droughts stands out. Famine and dislocation on a massive scale\u2014from 1968 to 1974 and again in the early and mid-1980s\u2014was blamed on two spikes in the severity of the 1960-1980s drought period. From the late 1960s to early 1980s famine killed 100,000 people, left 750,000 dependent on food aid, and affected most of the Sahel's 50\u00a0million people. The economies, agriculture, livestock and human populations of much of Mauritania, Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso (known as Upper Volta during the time of the drought) were severely impacted. As disruptive as the droughts of the late 20th century were, evidence of past droughts recorded in Ghanaian lake sediments suggest that multi-decadal megadroughts were common in West Africa over the past 3,000 years and that several droughts lasted far longer and were far more severe.\nSince the 1980s, summer rainfall in the Sahel has been increasing; this has been associated with an increase in vegetation, forming what has been called a 'greening' of the Sahel. The observed increase in rainfall is accounted for by enhancements in the African easterly jet, which is known to induce wet anomalies. A 2011 study found that the positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves accompanied the northward migration of the Sahel rainband.\nHistory.\nBecause the Sahel's rainfall is heavily concentrated in a very small period of the year, the region has been prone to dislocation when droughts have occurred ever since agriculture developed around 5,000 years ago. The Sahel is marked by rainfalls of less than a year, almost all of which occurs in one continuous season, which can run from several weeks to four months.\nDespite this vulnerability, the history of drought and famine in the Sahel do not perfectly correlate. While modern scientific climate and rainfall studies have been able to identify trends and even specific periods of drought in the region, oral and written records over the last millennium do not record famine in all places at all times of drought. One 1997 study, in attempting to map long scale rainfall records to historical accounts of famine in Northern Nigeria, concluded that \u201cthe most disruptive historical famines occurred when the cumulative deficit of rainfall fell below 1.3 times the standard deviation of long-term mean annual rainfall for a particular place.\u201d The 1982 to 1984 period, for instance, was particularly destructive to the pastoral Fula people of Senegal, Mali and Niger, and the Tuareg of northern Mali and Niger. The populations had not only suffered in the 1968 to 1974 period, but the inability of many to rebuild herds destroyed a decade earlier, along with factors as various as the shift of political power to settled populations with independence in the 1960s, Senegalese-Mauritanian border relations, and Niger's dependence upon falling world uranium prices coinciding in a destructive famine.\n600\u2013700 AD.\nSurviving contemporary records of climate in the Sahel begin with early Muslim travellers in the early Medieval Warm Period. These suggest that Sahel rainfall was relatively low in the 7th and 8th centuries and then increased substantially from about 800 AD. There was a decline in rainfall from about 1300 AD, but an increase again around 200 years later.\n\"Little Ice Age\" droughts.\nAccording to a study of West African drought based on Ghanaian lake sediments (not eyewitness historical accounts) published in the journal \"Science\" in April 2009:\nThe most recent of these [multicentury droughts] occurred between 1400 and 1750 CE (550 to 200 yr B.P.), similar in timing to the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1400 to 1850 CE), a well-known interval when Northern Hemisphere temperatures were cooler than at present. In contrast with earlier studies, which reconstructed wetter conditions in East Africa during this period, evidence from Lake Bosumtwi supports more recent studies suggesting that this interval was dry. Evidence for LIA drought is not restricted to Africa, however. Records from throughout the tropics, including the western Pacific warm pool, the Arabian Sea, continental Asia, and tropical South America all show evidence for dry conditions during this time period.\n1640.\nThe first major historically recorded drought in the Sahel occurred around 1640. Based on the reports of European travellers, a major drought after generally wet conditions also took place during the 1680s.\n1740s and 1750s.\nCycles of several wet decades followed by a drought were to be repeated during the 18th century. Sahelian drought again killed hundreds of thousands of people in the 1740s and 1750s. The 1740s and 1750s was recorded in chronicles of what is today Northern Nigeria, Niger and Mali as the \"Great Famine\", the worst for at least 200 years prior. It caused massive dislocation of the Sahelian states of the time, but also disrupted the Trans Saharan trade routes to North Africa and Europe.\n1830s.\nAround 1790 dry conditions similar to those of the late 20th century set in and continued until around 1870. After that, a very wet period set in for around 25 years, followed by a return to drier conditions. While the drying begun around 1895 and caused its first large famine only in the early 20th century, the 1820s and 1830s saw a 12 to 15-year drought and regional instances of major famine from Senegal to Chad. Historical records suggest this drought caused a large-scale emigration from the Bornu Empire, contributing to its rapid decline in the 19th century. In what is now northern Senegal, the Imamate of Futa Toro was struck by a famine caused by the failure of 1833's rainy season, leading to waves of famine until 1837.\nEarly 20th century droughts.\nThe first rain gauges in the Sahel date from 1898 and they reveal that a major drought in the 1910s, accompanied by large-scale famine, was followed by wet conditions during the 1920s and 1930s, reaching a peak with the very wet year of 1936. The 1940s saw several minor droughts \u2014 notably in 1949 \u2014 but the 1950s were consistently wet, and expansion of agriculture to feed growing populations characterised this decade. Many have thought this contributed to the severity of the subsequent Sahel droughts.\nLate 20th century droughts.\nBurkina Faso, northern Nigeria, southern Niger, far northern Cameroon (near Lake Chad) and central Chad all struggled with dwindling rain fall from the 1960s.\nThe 1968-73 drought severely affected several West African countries. Grazing became impossible and this triggered a large-scale famine that led to the first mobilization of external aid and the creation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development by United Nations. Up to 100,000 people and a third of livestock died. This drought was so catastrophic that it became known as the \"Great Sahelian drought\". \nIn 1983-84 Sahelian countries received some of the lowest rainfall ever recorded. However, even though this drought was more severe than that of the early 1970s, the human impact was less severe, since economies and societies had developed better coping mechanisms.\nA literature review from the \"African Journal of Ecology\" summarized the environmental changes that species faced after the late 20th century droughts, some of which includes (but is not limited to) severe declines in biodiversity and increases in other disturbances, such as fires.\n21st century droughts.\n2010 Sahel drought.\nThroughout June to August 2010, famine struck the Sahel. Niger's crops failed to mature in the heat which resulted in famine. 350,000 faced starvation and 1,200,000 were at risk of famine. In Chad, the temperature reached on June 22 in Faya-Largeau, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Niger tied its highest temperature record set in 1998, on also June 22, at in Bilma. That record was broken the next day, on June 23 when Bilma hit . The hottest temperature recorded in Sudan was reached on June 25, at in Dongola, breaking a record set in 1987. Niger reported diarrhoea, starvation, gastroenteritis, malnutrition and respiratory diseases killed and sickened many children July 14. The new military junta appealed for international food aid and has taken serious steps to calling overseas help since coming to office in February 2010. On July 26 the heat reached near-record levels over Chad and Niger.\n2012 Sahel drought.\nBy the middle of 2010, another drought in the western Sahel was predicted by several organisations for 2011 and 2012.\nPotential contributing factors.\nOriginally it was believed that the drought in the Sahel primarily was caused by humans over-using natural resources in the region through overgrazing, deforestation and poor land management. In the late 1990s, climate model studies suggested that large scale climate changes were also triggers for the drought.\nBased on Senegal river cycles, precipitation cycles of various El Sahel stations which are related to Solar (89\u2013120 years) Wolf-Gleissberg cycles, and on relations to Nile floods and Equatorial lake levels, Yousef and Ghilly in 2000 anticipated that there is a considerable probability that drought will occur El Sahel Zone in 2005\u00b14 years. This forecast was correct as drought occurred in El Niger in 2005 and again in 2010.\nIn 2002, after the phenomenon of global dimming was discovered, a CSIRO study suggested that the drought was probably caused by air pollution generated in Eurasia and North America, which changed the properties of clouds over the Atlantic Ocean, disturbing the monsoons and shifting the tropical rains southwards.\nIn 2005, a series of climate modeling studies performed at NOAA / Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory indicated that the late 20th century Sahel drought was probably a climatic response to changing sea surface temperature patterns, and that it could be viewed as a combination of natural variability superimposed upon an anthropogenically forced regional drying trend. Using GFDL CM2.X, these climate model simulations indicated that the general late 20th century Sahel drying trend was attributable to human-induced factors; largely due to an increase in greenhouse gases and partly due to an increase in atmospheric aerosols. A study published in 2013, done at the University of Washington, suggests that atmospheric aerosols caused a downward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The shift, the study says, left normally rainy areas in Central Africa much drier. In (CO2 value of \u2248860 ppm) Sahel rainfall could be reduced by up to 25% by year 2100, according to climate models.\nA 2006 study by NOAA scientists suggests that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation plays a leading role. An AMO warm phase strengthens the summer rainfall over Sahel, while a cold phase reduces it. The AMO entered a warm phase in 1995 and, assuming a 70-year cycle (following peaks in \u22481880 and \u22481950), will peak around 2020. A 2009 study found further evidence for a link between the AMO and West African drought. Later, a 2013 study found that the East Atlantic (EA) mode also modulates Sahel summer rainfall and further indicated that operational climate forecasting was unable to capture this EA impact on the Sahel.\nThe recovery of Sahel drought since the 1990s, coined \"Sahel Greening\" by media, is accounted for by enhancements in both the tropical easterly jet and the African easterly jet, both of which are known to induce wet anomalies. Moreover, positional shifts in the African easterly jet and African easterly waves (AEWs) accompanied the northward migration of the Sahel rainband. Change in the African easterly jet and AEWs are coupled to a northward shift and amplification of convective activity.\nUnited Nations response.\nIn 1973, The United Nations Sahelian Office (UNSO) was created to address the problems of drought in the Sahel region following the West African Sahel drought of 1968-73. In the 1990s, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was adopted and UNSO became the United Nations Development Programme's Office to Combat Desertification and Drought, as its scope broadened to be global rather than only focused on Africa.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

The shortages and drought have been linked to climate change.\nCountries.\nKazakhstan.\nIn early June 2021, photos from the Mangystau Region emerged on social media which showed emaciated horses on a verge of dying. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the cause for situation was due to lack of pasturage in the area as a result of several climatic conditions, and that measures would be implemented to prevent the further casualties of livestock.\nThe Khabar Agency on 16 June 2021 reported that approximately 2,000 livestock had died with Kazakh lawmakers calling for a state of emergency to be implemented in the Mangystau and Kyzylorda regions, citing the problems in farmers whom were unwilling to feed the cattle due to inflated costs for animal feed. In July 2021, due to worsening situation, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev called on Agriculture Minister Saparhan Omarov to resign, citing his failure to provide assistance to struggling farmers. On 13 July, a state of emergency was introduced in the Aral District in an attempt to solve the shortage of feed.

Orbost's 1978 rainfall of is as much as 256\u00a0mm (10\u00a0inches) above its previous record from 1935. In the winter, unseasonal rains struck normally bone-dry areas of northern Australia, and the wet season arrived early in the north in October. Though the Wet was not abnormally powerful in November and December, southeastern Australia remained exceptionally wet.\n1979.\nThe year 1979 began with extraordinarily hot conditions over southern Australia. Both livestock and wild animals perished in great numbers due to the heatwave, which saw places in northern South Australia regularly reach temperatures of at least from 31 December 1978 to 15 January 1979. In Western Australia, the Nullarbor region settlements of Mundrabilla and Forrest both reached maxima of , the sixth-highest recorded temperatures in Australia, on 3 and 13 January 1979, respectively. Temperatures reached in Sydney and in that summer's Ashes Test match, Australia's wicket keeper retired from heat exhaustion.\nRain fell heavily in the Mallee later in the month, making it a record wet month in many parts of western Victoria and far western New South Wales. The southeast corner, however, was already very dry. February and March saw a continuing powerful monsoon, but except for the Mallee in February and the east coast from Newcastle to Triabunna in March, southeastern Australia was dry. April had fairly normal rainfall except for continuing wet in Cape York Peninsula and dry conditions around Sydney and Hobart, where rainfall deficiencies were already acute.\nHeavy May rainfall over the wheat belt did not mask dry conditions around Canberra and especially in eastern Tasmania. June, however, proved the first really dry month: both Canberra and Hobart had their driest June ever, and Melbourne also set a record for low rainfall in July as cold fronts utterly failed to reach their normal latitudes.\nAugust and September, however, saw a series of tropical/extratropical interactions produce exceptional rainfall over most of Victoria, South Australia, western New South Wales and Tasmania. Flooding occurred in the Murray Basin and northern Tasmania. The coastal districts of New South Wales and southern Queensland, however, became extremely dry by September. Despite continuing heavy rains over south Australia, the Mallee and the Wimmera through spring, a dry November and near-record dry December ensured 1979 was the driest year until 2006 in Hobart and the driest since 1907 in Orbost.\nFurther north, although an area of the Darling Downs had had heavy rainfall in October, the wet season was very late and had not set in by December.\n1980.\nHeavy rains in East Gippsland in January proved a false forecast of what was to come, for in southeastern Australia February and March were exceptionally dry. Brisbane had its second-driest March on record, and apart from scattered areas the northern monsoon was modest. In the drier wheat country, many stations in the Mallee and adjacent parts of South Australia were completely rainless throughout the 1979/1980 summer, while the January rains that temporarily relieved the drought in East Gippsland did not reach Hobart.\nApril began very warm and dry, but an extensive upper low followed by a vigorous cold front on the 22nd made this an extremely wet month in South Australia, far western New South Wales, western Victoria and northern Tasmania. However, in most of New South Wales this blocking high produced uninterrupted dry weather. At Canberra, it was the driest April on record, and a remarkable feature of the month was that the highest rainfalls in New South Wales occurred in the normally dry Western Division.\nA cyclonic storm in May led to floods on the North Coast, but from June drought again set in over the eastern coastal belt between Bundaberg and Hobart. August and September were particularly dry. In these months Sydney received only and water restrictions were imposed on the city's residents. Elsewhere in eastern Australia the winter had near normal rainfall but was exceptionally warm, while September's dryness extended to every part of the mainland except alpine areas and the southern coastline, where the mild, wet weather was producing good conditions despite the burden of agisting cattle from drought-stricken areas.\nAlthough October was very wet in South Australia, western Victoria, and southern Queensland, drought-affected areas of New South Wales did not get significant rain until December, when hot, humid and unsettled weather brought some relief from the driest February to November period over the southeast corner since 1915.\nNonetheless, in most of the Hunter Basin, including Newcastle, 1980 was the driest year ever recorded. In some stations on the South Coast it was the driest since 1888. The wet season had also been very late over the tropics.\n1981.\nThe hot, humid weather of December continued throughout summer. January saw the most active monsoon since 1974 over Queensland: Hughenden received , or as much as 85 percent of its normal annual rainfall, while in the Wet Tropics rainfall was extraordinarily heavy: Babinda received a remarkable for the month. February was also wet, with Brisbane reporting its best rains since March 1974. In western Tasmania, however, unusually hot and dry conditions led to a very rare fire in the wet forests near Zeehan. In New South Wales, January was dry, but February saw very heavy rains that temporarily broke the long drought.\nMarch and April were generally dry except for Tasmania and a belt of western New South Wales in March and the North Coast of New South Wales in April. April was also very hot. However, the May to August period was exceptionally wet over Victoria (except East Gippsland), inland New South Wales and South Australia. A constant flow of powerful lows made this period the wettest on record over Victoria, and the Murray Basin experienced major flooding in August.\nMay\u2013normally a generally dry month\u2013was also very wet in inland Queensland, with Hughenden receiving against a median rainfall of , while July\u2019s heavy southern rainfall also extended into that State. Although rainfall in the winter over the coastal belt was below normal, except on the South Coast of New South Wales February and May rains had already eliminated drought for the moment.\nHowever, except for November when Brisbane received a record total of and heavy rain extended as far south as inland Victoria, and useful rains over coastal New South Wales and Queensland in October and December, the last third of 1981 was very dry and hot. In the Western District of Victoria it was the driest such period since 1967, with some places having record low totals in both September and December.\n1982.\nThe year again began with extremely hot conditions in southern Australia: in Melbourne, the mean maximum for the weekends of January to March was a remarkable . Although February was exceptionally dry, rainfall for January and March was on the whole above average, with the northern inland of New South Wales having its wettest March since 1931 and dry conditions appearing relieved.\nApril, however, saw dry conditions immediately return. Large falls late in the month over the settled areas of South Australia and a heavy cyclone over the Wet Tropics were not followed up. Though in May Tasmania and West Gippsland had good rainfall, most of New South Wales and Queensland except for the Brisbane area was already very dry.\nWith the 1982\u201383 El Ni\u00f1o event developing from June, things steadily became much worse. Huge high-pressure systems over Australia ensured very limited rain and consistent severe frosts in June. The month was the driest on record over many inland areas of New South Wales. July was much worse still, for apart from coastal areas there was almost no rain and in many areas of the wheat belt frosts reached levels never seen since temperature records began. Despite scattered July rainfall in East Gippsland, August was even worse, for the dry conditions were accompanied by quite remarkable heat as the anticyclones this time pushed hot, dry air from central Australia, with the only significant rainfall being on the Wet Tropical coast where Innisfail and Babinda had over . Late in the month temperatures reached in Mildura and overall mean maxima inland were as much as 4\u00b0C (7\u00b0F) above normal, causing ripening of wheat crops that had failed to develop in the cold, dry weather of previous months.\nSeptember saw useful rains over southwestern New South Wales, West Gippsland, and southeastern Tasmania, along with very heavy falls on the North Coast\u2013but no rain fell in the wheat districts where the drought was already developing into a record dry spell. October again saw heavy rain on the North Coast, but was very dry elsewhere, while November apart from western Tasmania and a small part of the Wet Tropics was very hot and almost rainless apart from thunderstorms mid-month. Bushfires broke out in East Gippsland and continued burning for several months. December saw some heavy thunderstorm rains in northeastern New South Wales and a single major rain event over the Port Phillip region and northeastern Tasmania, but extremely dry conditions continued elsewhere.\nFor the nine months from April to December 1982, most of inland eastern Australia experienced its lowest rainfall on record, as did parts of the South Gippsland. In the North Wimmera district covering Victoria's best wheat areas, the 1982 rainfall for this period was \"less than half the previous record low\". Many wheat crops failed completely for the first time in decades, and overall Victoria's yield was its lowest since 1944, while that of New South Wales was the lowest since 1957 and South Australia the lowest since 1977.\n1983.\nAlthough the year began with cool conditions over southeastern Australia, the monsoon was extremely weak in the north. February saw a turn back towards very hot weather, with Melbourne having three days over for only the second time on record. A huge dust storm carried away 50\u00a0million tonnes of the topsoil from the Mallee and Wimmera, and then the Ash Wednesday bushfires ravaged the tinder-dry forests of southeastern Australia. More than 70\u00a0people were killed, while fires moved from Gippsland into the South Coast of New South Wales.\nLate February saw scattered very heavy thunderstorms over New South Wales, but the month was close to the driest on record over Tasmania and Victoria and very dry again over the tropics. The beginning of March, however, saw torrential thunderstorms over the settled areas of South Australia, flooding areas that were fire-stricken only two weeks beforehand. Hot, humid weather continued throughout eastern Australia for the next three weeks as the monsoon suddenly became extremely powerful. On 21 March, a powerful monsoonal low moved southwards, drenching western New South Wales and the South Coast, and then western Victoria, Gippsland and Eastern Tasmania. At Tanybryn in the Otways, fell for the 24\u00a0hours ending 22 March, flooding the rebuilt Great Ocean Road. The month of March was the wettest since 1910 over most of the Mallee and Wimmera and since 1946 over the rest of western Victoria.\nAlthough the western slopes of New South Wales and most of eastern Queensland missed the heavy rains of March, both April and May were exceptionally wet over these regions as upper-level flows came in consistently from the north. The autumn of 1983 was the wettest over Queensland as a whole, and by May much of the Darling Downs was flooded. Steady, consistent rains for the rest of the year ensured a record wheat crop over most of Australia, with yields at levels that have never been equalled since.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

It is the word that the Turkana use to describe this dry period in their history.\nPeriodization.\nLamphear (1988) noted that chronological reckonings based on the Turkana age-set system suggested a date in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries. He notes that concurrent drought traditions suggested in the chronological reconstruction of neighboring communities indicates that the drought affected much of the Rift Valley region.\nRecords of Nile River flood stages date back to the 7th century AD and an analysis of the flood patterns and comparison with water levels in Lake Chad revealed a correlation between high Nile discharge and greater rainfall in equatorial East Africa. The analysis of Nile flood stages indicates a 'Minor Low' for the period 1800 to 1830, this was preceded by a 'Minor High' during the years 1725 to 1800 and was followed by a 'Minor High' which lasted between 1830 and 1870.\nStudies in Ethiopia by Pankhurst indicated major famines in 1880\u20131881, 1835 and in 1829. These studies are significant in that the country of Ethiopia borders present-day Turkana county. Meanwhile, Samburu historians interviewed by Straight et al. (2016) state that the Samburu separated from a society known as Burkineji in the wake of the 1830s Mutai. According to a Samburu Laibon interviewed by Fratkin (2011), the Sambur 'Il Kipkeku' age-set were warriors during the period c.1837-1851.\nThe various narratives, records and reports thus point to a long dry period starting about 1800 seemingly peaking with an intensely arid time during the mid-1830s. This would be congruent with Krapf's (1860) mention of a \"great famine of 1836\".\nPrelude.\nThere are a number of oral traditions from various communities across much of southern Africa that point to the region having experienced declining rainfall levels from about 1800 to about 1830. This saw the progressive desiccation of lakes, rivers and springs, a phenomenon observed by an employee of the East India Company in the 1820s who noted;\nEffects of the drought.\nDiminished carrying capacity for livestock.\nThe drought decimated the herds of the Chemwal, thought to have been cervicothoraic-humped Sanga crossbreeds, leading to the disintegration of the community.\nFamine.\nSengwer folklore has it that, \"It became dry and there was great hunger. The Siger went away to the east to Moru Eris, where most of them died of heat and starvation. So many died that there is still a place there called Kabosan (the rotten place)\".\nWar.\nFull-scale war flared up between the Turkana and Chemwal. Bands of Turkana warriors forced some Chemwalin northwards to the head of Lake Turkana where they formed the Inkabelo section of the developing Dassanech community. Other Chemwalin were pushed back onto the Suk hills, to the south to be incorporated by the Chok leading to the rise of the ritually important Kachepkai clan while others yet were assimilated by the Turkana where some became a new clan known simply as \"Siger\". The victorious Turkana took possession of the grazing and water resources of Moru Assiger.\nMass migration.\nOther Chemwalin were forced to abandon their highland abodes and fled eastwards where they ran into even drier conditions and a great many died.\nAftermath.\nThe Aoyate destroyed the lives and livelihoods of many inhabitants of the Rift Valley region.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Most of the dry spells during this period can be related to three El Ni\u00f1o events in 1911, 1913 and 1914, though rainfall deficiencies actually began in northern Australia before the first of these El Ni\u00f1os set in and did not ease in coastal districts of New South Wales until well after the last El Ni\u00f1o had firmly dissipated and trends toward very heavy rainfall developed in other areas of the continent.\nThe years before the drought had generally had satisfactory rainfall with impressive crop yields throughout most of the continent with the exception of the Gippsland region, the coastal districts of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. In these areas, the rainfall deficiencies of the Federation Drought had never disappeared at any point during the decade of the 1900s.\n1911.\nAt the beginning of the year, a strong La Ni\u00f1a event was producing heavy rain over eastern Australia. January was the wettest on record in Sydney, and February was a phenomenally wet month in Victoria and southwestern New South Wales, with places like Pooncarie on the lower Darling River recording for the month. Averaged over Victoria, February 1911 stands as the third-wettest month since 1885 after October 1975 and February 1973. Heavy monsoonal rain drenched Queensland throughout the summer. These months, however, were virtually rainless in the southwestern quarter of the continent and quite dry in the Kimberley and Top End.\nEarly March saw exceptionally heavy rains in southern Victoria and eastern Tasmania: Melbourne's rainfall of remains a March record. However, in the Top End and Kimberley, drought was already established as Darwin had its \"driest\" March in 138 years of record with only as against an average of . April saw some good late wet season rains in the north due to a severe tropical cyclone drenching Port Douglas with a daily fall of and promising rains in southwestern Australia.\nHowever, despite the \"big wet\" continuing in southern Victoria through May and June, southwestern Australia and to lesser extent the settled parts of South Australia and southeast Queensland began to have major rainfall deficiencies in those months. By August dry conditions were, as is usual for El Ni\u00f1o years, general except in coastal districts of New South Wales and the southeast of Western Australia. Southwestern Australia was particularly hard-hit: wheat crops failed completely in many places and led to a revolution in water supply and farming techniques to cope with rainfalls lower than previously known. In the humid forest belt, 1911 was the driest year of the twentieth century at Margaret River and Cape Leeuwin and even the Warren River, the most nearly perennial river in all of WA, ceased to flow during the ensuing summer.\nApart from one big September fall in Victoria, dry and often hot conditions did not ease until one of the heaviest downpours ever known in Western Queensland fell in late November. This was followed by heavy general falls in December except in Queensland and northeastern New South Wales. November was the driest on record in many parts of western Victoria and eastern Queensland.\n1912.\nThe hopes the good December rains gave soon disappeared as January was exceptionally dry almost throughout the continent except for a few normally-dry areas between Perth and Geraldton. Major tropical cyclones provided respite to the Kimberley in February and the Eucla in March, whilst a small coastal belt of the Wet Tropics had exceptionally heavy rainfall in April and May, with Innisfail recording for those two months.\nHowever, elsewhere exceptionally dry conditions continued until a series of low pressure systems in June and July provided record-breaking rainfalls for that time of year in inland Queensland and New South Wales. Indeed, the winter averaged over those two states was nearly as wet as those of 1950 and 1998. The wheat areas of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria missed the heavy June falls completely but were very wet in July and the Western District of Victoria was relieved of anxiety by exceptionally heavy rainfall in the first eighteen days of September. Despite a dry October outside of southeastern Queensland rainfall for the rest of the year was generally satisfactory throughout southern Australia, though the wet season did not start well in the north.\n1913.\nThis year opened with some heavy monsoonal rains over the more coastal areas of Queensland and the Northern Territory in January; however, the month was very dry in the southeast apart from southern Tasmania. February was dry west of a line from Derby to Eucla and east from one between Melbourne and Bundaberg, but elsewhere some exceptionally heavy thunderstorm rains meant the month was a wet one. Adelaide received a particularly intense fall of on the 17th, with the worst flash flooding in the city's history. Apart from the North Coast of New South Wales, March was particularly wet, so much so that major flooding occurred in most rivers between Melbourne and Sydney. In Melbourne, the total of 23 rainy days is a record for any month between November and April and the low sunshine hours of only four per day also unparalleled.\nThe period around 12 April saw an extremely heavy if localised rainfall in the Albany district with totals of up to in a day near the Stirling Range and near Katanning. April was also very wet in the southern coastal districts of New South Wales, but May and June saw an unseasonal continuation of easterly winds. Thus, Tasmania, southwestern WA and the settled areas of South Australia were very dry, whilst most of New South Wales, Queensland and East Gippsland were wet. Apart from scattered coastal areas and the extreme southwest, July was exceptionally dry: Ouyen did not receive any rain in June or July and Adelaide's rainfall for the period of only was less than in the disastrous year of 1982. Frosts were exceptionally severe and led to fears of crop losses.\nThe following three months saw an abrupt reversal, with dry conditions in Queensland and most of New South Wales contrasting with good rains in the Mallee, South Australia and southwestern WA. August was particularly noteworthy as the most completely rainless month known in Queensland and New South Wales. The rain turned an unpromising wheat season into one of the best on record despite a violent cold outbreak in the east early in November when Melbourne recorded its lowest-ever maximum for that month on Melbourne Cup Day of just . December saw very wet conditions in Queensland, with record flows in some Cape York Peninsula streams; but, apart from one rain event mid-month with another record daily total in Adelaide, dry weather prevailed elsewhere.\n1914.\nJanuary was very wet in the Top End, Kimberley and central Australia, but distinctly dry in the south of the continent, leading onto a major heatwave with exceptionally dry conditions in the far southeast during February, when Orbost received no rain and Hobart only . Torrential rains around Eden and Bega in March and wet conditions in southeastern Australia (especially Tasmania) in April were followed by a second heavy fall in a belt from Broome to the Darling Downs in May. The area around Uluru saw some of the heaviest rainfalls known until the 1970s that month.\nHowever, in the southern wheat belt May 1914 began a trend of powerful anticyclones and dry, easterly winds that was at the time quite unprecedented and not rivalled until 1982. In southwestern Australia the rainy season was extraordinarily poor from beginning to end, with only one significant fall all through from May to October and severe frosts prevalent throughout. June, August, September and October were all record dry months in Victoria and Tasmania, and even unusually heavy July rainfall in Gippsland could do nothing to alleviate the drought. The result was, that with the northerly areas around the Darling Downs not well developed yet, Australia's wheat crop was almost completely lost after an exceptionally hot October in which temperatures reached over even in Hobart. Wheat yields in Victoria were only around 0.10 tonne per hectare and in WA even lower.\nIn coastal districts of New South Wales, however, the extraordinarily powerful anticyclones that desiccated the interior produced powerful onshore winds and extremely heavy rain: in Port Macquarie, the spring was the wettest on record. November and December were notably hot and humid, with rainfall near or above normal except in Tasmania and coastal Queensland during November. The southeast of Western Australia was particularly wet during these months, but in the desiccated agricultural regions the rain was much too late to save crops or pastures.\n1915.\nThe heavy rainfall of November and December in Western Australia continued throughout the first two months of 1915, culminating in quite unseasonable downpours over the southwest at the end of February and beginning of March. During this period Perth had a spell of ten successive rainy days \u2013 more than it normally has in February and March combined. El Ni\u00f1o, however, remained powerful and eastern Australia was almost uniformly dry throughout the first three months of 1915 except for East Gippsland in January and Tasmania in March. Brisbane's March 1915 rainfall of is its lowest ever and only 2 percent of its long-term March mean, whilst even normally-soaked Cairns received only . April was equally dry in Queensland and the Northern Territory and only Tasmania and an area near Onslow was even remotely above average across the whole continent.\nIn May, however, a trend of wet weather established itself across western Victoria, South Australia and southern Western Australia and continued right through to September. This wetness was backed up by the mildest winter across the southeast until global warming began in 1980. Crops that barely grew in 1914 grew with extraordinary vigour, and flooding even occurred in the Wimmera, around Adelaide and more severely in the Blackwood River of Western Australia. Although September saw unseasonable rain as far north as Mount Isa, the drought did not ease in Queensland, coastal New South Wales or Gippsland. Strong westerly winds and tinder-dry forests in August led to major bushfires breaking out in the North Coast of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. Although occasional rain put many fires out in August and September, the dryness in these regions intensified greatly still in October and November due to extremely powerful westerly weather that saw New South Wales record its driest month of the twentieth century (statewide average rainfall ). Despite patchy rain in December 1915 was still the driest calendar year on record in most of the North Coast of New South Wales and the Atherton Tableland of Queensland. Notable low falls include:\nThe year was, however, very wet in almost all of Western Australia, and also in western Tasmania and an area around Darwin, where December saw an extremely active monsoon with flooding.\n1916.\nThis year opened with heavy rain in Tasmania, southern Victoria and western Queensland, but the drought areas on the east coast did not gain relief until April. May, however was very dry except in a few coastal parts of New South Wales. This time, however, a powerful La Ni\u00f1a developed and produced starting in June exceptionally heavy rain across almost all inland areas of the continent. Adelaide set a record monthly rainfall of in June and there was major flooding of the whole city, whilst in July record rainfalls occurred throughout southwestern Queensland.\nStill, it was not until nearly continent-wide heavy rains and flooding from late September to mid-December that the drought disappeared fully from the eastern coastal areas, especially Gippsland.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

La Ni\u00f1a caused dry weather across much of the Southeast, this was evident due to the fact that winter 2005\u201306 was dry for much of the region. On top of that, the Bermuda High, also known as the Azores High, a hot and dry air mass over the Atlantic, formed unusually far west, and blocked storms from entering the region, a pattern that wouldn't break until 2008. The dryness continued into 2006. However, it was mild in comparison in 2007 and did not cause too many effects. Following that, 2007 was very dry across the Southeastern U.S. receiving record-low rainfall during the year. Mississippi and Georgia each had their driest spring on record, where spring typically is very wet across the region. The following summer was scorching hot and dry across the region with record-breaking wildfires across the region. In fact, August 2007 would end up being the warmest August and second-hottest month of any month across the region. with Knoxville, Tennessee having a daily maximum temperature above on 16 days that month, and an all-time record.. High temperatures were still in the 90s \u00b0F (32+ \u00b0C) as far late as the end of October. The drought peaked in October, with over 70% of the Southeast in D4 or the worst category of drought, known as exceptional. 2007 would be the second-driest year as a whole over the region.

The theory has been dismissed by the scientific community and mainstream media as fringe science or pseudoscience.\nKey claims and components.\nThe 2011\u20132017 drought inspired alarm among many, leading to the emergence of conspiracy theories purporting to explain the cause of a complex problem using oversimplified and non-evidence-based explanations.\nMany of the proponents claim that chemtrails are used to affect storm clouds, in a manner of suppressing the development of precipitation. This would occur because of the presence of too many cloud condensation nuclei, or \"cloud seeds\", in a single area. Others say that technologies similar to HAARP (a federal ionospheric research program, which was decommissioned in 2015), are being used to create a large and stubborn high-pressure area over the West Coast of the United States.

Said to be \"the worst in 60 years\", the drought caused a severe food crisis across Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya that threatened the livelihood of 9.5\u00a0million people. Many refugees from southern Somalia fled to neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, where crowded, unsanitary conditions together with severe malnutrition led to a large number of deaths. Other countries in East Africa, including Sudan, South Sudan and parts of Uganda, were also affected by a food crisis.\nAccording to FAO-Somalia, the food crisis in Somalia primarily affected farmers in the south rather than the northern pastoralists. Human Rights Watch (HRW) consequently noted that most of the displaced persons belonged to the agro-pastoral Rahanweyn clan and the agricultural Bantu ethnic minority group. On 20 July, the United Nations officially declared famine in two regions in the southern part of the country (IPC Phase 5), the first time a famine had been declared in the region by the UN in nearly thirty years. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have died in southern Somalia before famine was declared. This was mainly a result of Western governments preventing aid from reaching affected areas in an attempt to weaken the Al-Shabaab militant group, against whom they were engaged.\nAlthough fighting disrupted aid delivery in some areas, a scaling up of relief operations in mid-November had unexpectedly significantly reduced malnutrition and mortality rates in southern Somalia, prompting the UN to downgrade the humanitarian situation in the Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabele regions from famine to emergency levels. According to the Lutheran World Federation, military activities in the country's southern conflict zones had also by early December 2011 greatly reduced the movement of migrants. By February 2012, several thousand people had also begun returning to their homes and farms. In addition, humanitarian access to rebel-controlled areas had improved and rainfall had surpassed expectations, improving the prospects of a good harvest in early 2012.\nBy January 2012, the food crisis in southern Somalia was no longer at emergency levels according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The UN indicated in February 2012 that indirect data from health and relief centers pointed to improved general conditions from August 2011. The UN also announced that the famine in southern Somalia was over. However, FEWS NET indicated that Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of food insecurity persisted through March in several areas on account of crop flooding and ongoing military operations in these areas, which restricted humanitarian access, trade and movement.\nAid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery efforts, including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds. Long-term strategies by national governments in conjunction with development agencies were said to offer the most sustainable results.\nBackground.\nWeather conditions over the Pacific, including an unusually strong La Ni\u00f1a, interrupted seasonal rains for two consecutive seasons. The rains failed in 2011 in Kenya and Ethiopia, and for the previous two years in Somalia. In many areas, the precipitation rate during the main rainy season from April to June, the primary season, was less than 30% of the average of 1995\u20132010. The lack of rain led to crop failure and widespread loss of livestock, as high as 40\u201360% in some areas, which decreased milk production as well as exacerbating a poor harvest. As a result, cereal prices rose to record levels while livestock prices and wages fell, reducing purchasing power across the region. Rains were also not expected to return until September of the year. The crisis is compounded by rebel activity around southern Somalia from the Al-Shabaab group.\nThe head of the United States Agency for International Development, Rajiv Shah, stated that climate change contributed to the severity of the crisis. \"There's no question that hotter and drier growing conditions in sub-Saharan Africa have reduced the resiliency of these communities.\" On the other hand, two experts with the International Livestock Research Institute suggested that it was premature to blame climate change for the drought. Indeed, the majority of climate models had predicted a long-term increase in rain for this area. While there is consensus that a particularly strong La Ni\u00f1a contributed to the intensity of the drought, the relationship between La Ni\u00f1a and climate change is not well-established.\nThe failure of the international community to heed the early warning system was criticized for leading to a worsening of the crisis. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network, financed by U.S.A.I.D., anticipated the crisis as early as August 2010, and by January 2011, the American\nambassador to Kenya declared a disaster and called for urgent assistance. On 7 June 2011, FEWS NET declared that the crisis was \"the most severe food security emergency in the world today, and the current humanitarian response is inadequate to prevent further deterioration\". The UN later announced on 28 June that 12 million people in the East Africa region were affected by the drought and that some areas were on the brink of famine, with many displaced in search of water and food. Oxfam's humanitarian director Jane Cocking stated that \"This is a preventable disaster and solutions are possible\". Suzanne Dvorak, the chief executive of Save the Children, wrote that \"politicians and policymakers in rich countries are often skeptical about taking preventative action because they think aid agencies are inflating the problem. Developing country governments are embarrassed about being seen as unable to feed their people. [...] these children are wasting away in a disaster that we could\u2014and should\u2014have prevented.\" Soon after a famine was declared in parts of southern Somalia. Oxfam also charged several European governments of \"wilful neglect\" over the crisis. It issued a statement saying that \"The warning signs have been seen for months, and the world has been slow to act. Much greater long-term investment is needed in food production and basic development to help people cope with poor rains and ensure that this is the last famine in the region.\"\nHumanitarian situation.\nOn 20 July 2011, the UN declared a famine in the Lower Shabelle and Bakool, two regions of southern Somalia. On 3 August, famine was further declared in the Balcad and Cadale districts in Middle Shabelle as well as the IDP settlements in Mogadishu and Afgooye in response to data from the UN's food security and nutrition analysis unit. According to the UN, famine would spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia in four to six weeks due to inadequate humanitarian response caused both by ongoing access restrictions and funding gaps. The Economist also reported that widespread famine would soon occur across the entire Horn of Africa, \"a situation...not seen for 25 years\".\nAccording to Luca Alivoni, the head of FAO-Somalia, the food crisis in Somalia has primarily affected farmers in the south rather than the northern pastoralists since farmers often stay behind on their land plots to \"protect their crops\", while herders move with their livestock to pastureland.\nOn 20 July 2011, staple prices were at 68% over the five-year average, including increases of up to 240% in southern Somalia, 117% in south-eastern Ethiopia, and 58% in northern Kenya. In early July, the UN World Food Programme said that it expected 10 million people across the Horn of Africa region to need food aid, revising upward an earlier estimate of 6\u00a0million. Later in the month, the UN further updated the figure to 12\u00a0million, with 2.8\u00a0million in southern Somalia alone, which was the most affected area. On 3 August, the UN declared famine in three other regions of southern Somalia, citing worsening conditions and inadequate humanitarian response. Famine was expected to spread across all regions of the south in the following four to six weeks. On 5 Sep, the UN added the entire Bay region in Somalia to the list of famine-stricken areas. The UN has conducted several airlifts of supplies in addition to on-the-ground assistance, but humanitarian response to the crisis has been hindered by a severe lack of funding for international aid coupled with security issues in the region. As of September 2011, 63 percent of the UN's appeal for $2.5\u00a0billion (US) in humanitarian assistance has been financed.\nThe crisis was expected to worsen in the following months, peaking in August and September, with large-scale assistance needed until at least December 2011. Torrential rains also exacerbated the situation in Mogadishu by destroying makeshift homes. Tens of thousands of southern Somalia's internally displaced people were consequently left out in the cold.\nIn addition, the Kenyan Red Cross warns of a looming humanitarian crisis in the northwestern Turkana region of Kenya, which borders South Sudan. According to officials with the aid agency, over three-fourths of the area's population is now in dire need of food supplies. Malnutrition levels are also at their highest. As a consequence, schools in the region have shut down \"because there is no food for the children\". About 385,000 children in these neglected parts of Kenya are already malnourished, along with 90,000 pregnant and breast feeding women. A further 3.5\u00a0million people in Kenya are estimated to be at risk of malnutrition.\nIn August 2012, an estimated 87,000 people in the Taita-Taveta District of Kenya were reportedly affected by famine, a situation attributed to a combination of wildlife invasions and drought. Large herds of elephants and monkeys overran farms in the district's lowland and highland areas, respectively, ruining thousands of acres of crops. Local residents, about 67,000 of whom were receiving food aid, also accused the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) of intentionally moving the monkeys to the district. However, this was denied by the KWS.\nFood shortages have also been reported in northern and eastern Uganda. The Karamoja region and the Bulambuli district, in particular, are among the worst hit areas, with an estimated 1.2\u00a0million Ugandans affected. The Ugandan government has also indicated that as of September 2011, acute deficits in foodstuffs are expected in 35 of the country's districts.\nAlthough fighting disrupted aid delivery in some areas, a scaling up of relief operations in mid-November had unexpectedly significantly reduced malnutrition and mortality rates in southern Somalia, prompting the UN to downgrade the humanitarian situation in the Bay, Bakool and Lower Shabele regions from famine to emergency levels. Humanitarian access to rebel-controlled areas had also improved and rainfall had surpassed expectations, improving the prospects of a good harvest in early 2012. Despite the re-imposition of blocks by the militants on the delivery of relief supplies in some areas under their control, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reported in January 2012 that the food crisis in southern Somalia was by then no longer at emergency levels. Although security restrictions precluded the collection of updated information in December/January for a few regions in southern Somalia, the UN indicated in February 2012 that indirect data from health and relief centers pointed to improved general conditions from August 2011. The UN also announced that the famine in southern Somalia was over. However, FEWS NET indicated that Emergency (IPC Phase 4) levels of food insecurity would persist through March in the southern riverine parts of the Juba and Gedo regions, the south-central agropastoral zones of Hiran and Middle Shebele, the southeast pastoral sections of Shebele and Juba, and the north-central Coastal Deeh on account of crop flooding and ongoing military operations in these areas that have restricted humanitarian access, trade and movement. The UN also warned that, in a worst-case scenario of poor rains and price instability, conditions would remain at crisis level for about 31% of the population in limited-access areas until the August harvest season. In the most-likely scenario, the FSNAU and FEWS NET expect the April\u2013June rains to be average. Ameliorated food security outcomes are also expected on account of the start of the \"Deyr\" harvest, which reached 200% of the post-war mean and is predicted to be significantly higher than usual. Except for the Juba region, where damage from flooding and limitations on trade have kept cereal prices high, the above average harvest has led to a substantial drop in overall cereal prices in the south's vulnerable regions. This has resulted in more agricultural wage labour opportunities for underprivileged agropastoral households and increased the purchasing power of pastoralists. With the exception of some coastal areas, where a little under 95,000 pastoralists have yet to recover their herd sizes from the drought and consequently still require emergency livelihood assistance (IPC Phase 4), the abundant rainfall in most parts of central and northern Somalia has replenished pastureland and also further boosted the purchasing power of local herders. With the benefit of the current harvest likely to ebb in May, the UN stressed that continued multi-sectoral response is necessary to secure the recent gains made, and that general humanitarian needs requiring international assistance would persist until at least September 2012.\nAccording to the Sudan Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CSFAM) for January 2012, due to subpar cereal production and increased cereal prices caused by intense conflict that has limited trade, humanitarian and population movements, an estimated 4.2\u00a0million people in Sudan are predicted to be in the Stressed (IPC Phase 3), Crisis and Emergency levels during the first three or four months of 2012. The number was previously estimated at 3.3\u00a0million people in December 2011, and is expected to especially affect the South Kordofan, North Darfur and Blue Nile states. Below average cereal production and a trade blockade imposed by Sudan have also extended food insecurity in South Sudan, with the northern and northeastern sections of the nation expected to be at Stressed and Crisis levels through March.\nAid agencies have now shifted their emphasis to recovery efforts, including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds. Long-term strategies by national governments in conjunction with development agencies are believed to offer the most sustainable results.\nRefugee crisis.\nBy 15 September, more than 920,000 refugees from Somalia had reportedly fled to neighboring countries, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia. At the height of the crisis in June 2011, the UNHCR base in Dadaab, Kenya hosted at least 440,000 people in three refugee camps, though the maximum capacity was 90,000. More than 1,500 refugees continued to arrive every day from southern Somalia, 80 per cent of whom were women and children. UN High Commissioner for Refugees spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said that many people had died en route. Within the camps, infant mortality had risen threefold in the few months leading up to July 2011. The overall mortality rate was 7.4 out of 10,000 per day, which was more than seven times as high as the \"emergency\" rate of 1 out of 10,000 per day. There was an upsurge in sexual violence against women and girls, with the number of cases reported increasing by over 4 times. Incidents of sexual violence occurred primarily during travel to the refugee camps, with some cases reported in the camps themselves or as new refugees went in search for firewood. This put them at high risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS. According to UN representative Radhika Coomaraswamy, the food crisis had forced many women to leave their homes in search of assistance, where they were often without the protection of their family and clan.\nIn July 2011, Dolo Odo, Ethiopia also hosted at least 110,000 refugees from Somalia, most of whom had arrived recently. The three camps at Bokolomanyo, Melkadida, and Kobe all exceeded their maximum capacity; one more camp was reportedly being built while another was planned in the future. Water shortage reportedly affected all the facilities.\nAccording to the Lutheran World Federation, military activities in the conflict zones of southern Somalia and a scaling up of relief operations had by early December 2011 greatly reduced the movement of migrants. By February 2012, several thousand people had also begun returning to their homes and farms.\nHealth and disease.\nIn July 2011, measles cases broke out in the Dadaab camp, with 462 cases confirmed including 11 deaths. Ethiopia and Kenya were also facing a severe measles epidemic, attributed in part to the refugee crisis, with over 17,500 cases reported in the first 6 months. WHO statistics put the number of children that were then most at the risk of measles at 2\u00a0million. The epidemic in Ethiopia may have led to an measles outbreak in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The World Health Organization stated that \"8.8\u00a0million people are at risk of malaria and 5 million of cholera\" in Ethiopia, due to crowded, unsanitary conditions. Malnutrition rates among children in July also reached 30 percent in parts of Kenya and Ethiopia and over 50% in southern Somalia, although the latter figure dropped to 36% by mid-September according to the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit. Doctors Without Borders (M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res) was also treating more than 10,000 severely malnourished children in its feeding centers and clinics. In July 2011, the UN's food security and nutrition analysis unit announced that the situation in southern Somalia then met all three characteristics of widespread famine: a) more than 30 percent of children were suffering from acute malnutrition; b) more than two adults or four children were dying of hunger each day for every group of 10,000 people; and c) the population had access to less than 2,100 kilocalories of food and four liters of water per day. In August, cholera was suspected in 181 deaths in Mogadishu, along with confirmed reports of several other outbreaks elsewhere in Somalia, thus raising fears of tragedy for a severely weakened population. In mid-November, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also announced that 60 cholera cases, with 10 lab-confirmed and one fatality, had hit the Dadaab refugee camp in northern Kenya.\nBy early December 2011, the UN's OCHA bureau announced that a scaling up of relief operations had resulted in an improvement in global and severe acute malnutrition rates as well as a decrease in mortality rates in southern Somalia's conflict zones relative to the start of the drought crisis in July/August. Although acute malnutrition rates remained much higher than median global acute malnutrition (GAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) rates for the October\u2013December season, global acute malnutrition rates had fallen from 30\u201358 percent to 20\u201334 percent and severe acute malnutrition rates in turn dropped from 9\u201329 percent in July to 6\u201311 percent. The mortality rate likewise declined from 1.1\u20136.1 per 10,000 people per day in July/August to 0.6\u20132.8 per 10,000 people per day. Despite some gaps in aid delivery in certain areas due imposed Islamist bans, the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) also reported that its Nutrition Cluster had by December reached 357,107 of the estimated 450,000 children that had been acutely malnourished at the start of the crisis in July.\nSecurity.\nIn July 2011, the head of United States Agency for International Development, Rajiv Shah, stated that the drought may worsen the security situation in the region. \"This is happening precisely in a part of the world that our Defense Secretary Leon Panetta just said is a critical part of our fight against terrorism and our overall international security. It just underscores the deep link between food security and national security.\" Armed herders are violently competing for dwindling resources. In Kenya alone more than 100 herders have been killed.\nFears of the Al-Shabaab insurgents, who control most of southern Somalia, continue to hinder humanitarian operations in the region. \"We need significantly better access than we have at the moment to address an emergency of this scale.\" UN agencies are \"in a dialogue\" with al-Shabaab about securing airstrips in areas under the insurgent group's control to deliver aid. The United Nations World Food Programme is considering a return to southern Somalia, from which it withdrew in 2010 after threats from the rebel group Al-Shabaab. It estimates that there are 1 million people in areas it cannot currently access. In early July 2011, Al-Shabaab announced that it had withdrawn its restrictions on international humanitarian workers, and that all aid organizations will be allowed in.\nHowever, on 22 July, the group stated that the ban on certain organizations remains in place. In a statement, Al-Shabaab's spokesman Sheikh Ali Dhere indicated that his organization had no issue with allowing \"Muslims and non-Muslims to help the drought affected people\", but that they will \"only be permitted to work if they do not have other interests\". He stated that banned agencies belong to two categories: some that are acting as spies, while others, including the UN, that have \"a political agenda, doing nothing like what they were claiming\". He also criticized aid agencies that are providing assistance in neighboring countries, stating that \"They are luring needy people with food in order to teach them their Christianity.\" Hassan Liban, a director of the British charity Islamic Relief which has managed to gain access through negotiations, said that Al-Shabaab were not keen on emergency relief that was not tied to longer-term programmes to help people recover their livelihoods. He stated that \"To any organisation that just wants to send food, they say: 'Give us the food and go away'. But if it's sustainable and planned they will allow you to work.\"\nAl-Shabaab members have allegedly intimidated, kidnapped and killed some aid workers, leading to a partial suspension of humanitarian operations in southern Somalia. Ethiopia and the UN also accuse the Eritrean government of backing the insurgents. On 28 July, African Union peacekeepers launched a major offensive against Al-Shabaab militants in northern Mogadishu, Somalia, in an effort to protect famine relief efforts from attacks. Six were killed during the conflict, and key territory was seized from the insurgents. Al-Shabaab has sent 300 reinforcement fighters to Mogadishu in the preceding days, according to Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, spokesman for the AU peacekeeping force in Somalia. He stated that \"This action will further increase security ... and ensure that aid agencies can continue to operate to get vital supplies to internally displaced.\" As of 1 August, the beginning of the Ramadan, the African Union offensive in ongoing. However, AU intelligence sources said that the insurgents are planning a counteroffensive during the month of fasting.\nOn 6 August 2011, Reuters reported that the Transitional Federal Government's troops and their AMISOM allies managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Witnesses reported Al-Shabaab vehicles abandoning their bases in the capital for the south-central city of Baidoa. The group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage described the exodus as a tactical retreat, and vowed to continue the insurgency against the national government. Observers have also suggested that the pullout may at least in part have been caused by internal ideological rifts in the rebel organization.\nOn 4 July 2011, the Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali appointed a national committee to tackle the severe drought affecting the southern part of the country. The committee consists of several federal-level members of government, including the Ministers of Defense, Health, Interior, Finance, Public Works, Women's Affairs and Information. It is tasked with assessing and addressing the needs of the drought-impacted segments of the population.\nOn 13 August, Prime Minister Ali also announced the creation of a new 300-man security force in response to discussions with UN officials about the situation in Mogadishu. The UN stated earlier in the week that aid was only reaching around 20% of the drought-affected peoples, with most of the famine-stricken areas still controlled by Al-Shabaab rebels. Assisted by African peacekeepers, the new military unit will have as its primary goal to protect convoys and food aid, as well as to secure the IDP camps themselves when the relief supplies are being distributed. Besides helping to stabilize the city, the new protection force is also tasked with combating looting and banditry in addition to other vices.\nOn 16 August, Neela Ghoshal, an official with Human Rights Watch, told Reuters that her group had received complaints of government soldiers robbing civilians. However, Voice of America reported earlier in the month that, according to witnesses at a camp in Mogadishu, men dressed as government troops began stealing food rations, after which point government soldiers that were guarding the supplies opened fire on the looters. In response to the incident, the Somali government forces Commander General Abdikarim Dhengobadan denied that his men were responsible for the looting. The Information Minister of Somalia Abdirahman Omar Osman and the AMISOM commander Paddy Akunda have also previously accused Al-Shabaab militants of disguising themselves as Somali government soldiers before attacking government and AMISOM positions. Despite this, according to the UN, the security situation in the capital has generally improved since the withdrawal of Al-Shabaab militants, thus facilitating the scaling up of relief efforts in the region.\nOn 13 October 2011, two women from Spain employed as aid workers with Doctors Without Borders at the Dadaab refugee camp were kidnapped by gunmen. The U.N. temporarily suspended all non-lifesaving aid operations at Dadaab. The Spanish branch of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) announced that all 49 expatriate staff working for the charity would be evacuated to Nairobi, leaving 343 local staff members in Dadaab. Certain activities such as registering new arrivals and journeying outside camp to meet refugees walking the final miles would be suspended. In December 2011, three Somali aid workers were also shot and killed in the central Somali town of Mataban. Two of the workers were UN World Food Programme employees and the third worked for a partner organization. The gunman turned himself in to the local authorities.\nIn October 2011 a coordinated operation, Operation Linda Nchi, between the Somali military and the Kenyan military, began against the Al-Shabaab militants, who are alleged to have kidnapped several foreign aid workers and tourists inside Kenya. According to the Ethiopian Foreign Minister, the mission represents one of the final stages of the Islamist insurgency.\nInternational response.\nHumanitarian agencies have requested US$2.48\u00a0billion to address the crisis, but as of 1 August have secured less than half that amount. The European Union announced it would provide \u20ac5.67\u00a0million to help millions of people in the Horn of Africa affected by the drought. On 16 July, the UK government pledged \u00a352.25\u00a0million, on top of \u00a338\u00a0million pledged earlier that month and more than \u00a313\u00a0million raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee. As of 25 August, the amount raised by the Disasters Emergency Committee had increased to \u00a357\u00a0million.\nAustralia announced at the end of July that it would supply an additional $20\u00a0million, thereby increasing the total aid volume to $80\u00a0million. As of 5 October, the Canadian government and people also contributed about $142\u00a0million CAD to the relief efforts in Eastern Africa, with the Canadian authorities pledging an additional $70\u00a0million CAD in matching funds. Much of the fundraising done from Canadians was contributed to the Humanitarian Coalition who distributed to its 5 partners. Over C$14 Million dollars was raised by the Coalition.\nIn late August 2011, Saudi Arabia announced that it would donate $60\u00a0million in aid to the drought-impacted peoples in Somalia and urged the Al-Shabaab militants to cease their hostilities so as to facilitate the delivery of relief materials. Iran dispatched multiple convoys of humanitarian supplies and $25\u00a0million to the famine-stricken parts of the country, with Lebanon sending its first consignment to Mogadishu over the same period. Despite experiencing financial difficulties, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip also assisted in the relief efforts. Imams in mosques raised awareness about the drought crisis and its parallels with the Palestinian situation, and urged Palestinians to contribute; the Arab Doctors Union Gaza branch also launched a fund-raising initiative, with most donations coming from affluent entrepreneurs and local NGOs. Additionally, Bahrain donated $3\u00a0million to the campaign, with Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates also sending supplies.\nElsewhere, Turkey dispatched multiple aid convoys to Somalia, working closely with the Somali Red Crescent Society to deliver the materials to the drought-stricken parts of the country. China also donated $16\u00a0million to the relief efforts, with Venezuela sending $5\u00a0million, Russia contributing $3\u00a0million, and Kazakhstan adding $500,000. In addition, Azerbaijan and Indonesia have assisted in the humanitarian campaign, with Malaysia dispatching aid workers on site.\nThe U.S. has pledged an additional $5\u00a0million to help refugees from Somalia on top of a previously budgeted $63\u00a0million for general support in the larger East Africa region. However, the U.S. has withheld aid from the Somalia region, due to recent regulations which prevent the sending of food aid that risks \"materially benefiting\" designated terrorists, in this case the rebel group Al-Shabaab. The regulations came into force after reports that Al-Shabaab was \"taxing food convoys\", and as a result U.S. aid spending in Somalia has dropped from $150\u00a0million to $13\u00a0million this year. Mercy Corps has stated that \"The aid effort will remain totally inadequate if legal restrictions force the US to remain on the sidelines\". In addition, under U.S. regulations, international organizations may face prosecution under US law if their humanitarian aid materially benefits Al-Shabaab. However, on 2 August, the United States announced that it would no longer prosecute humanitarian organizations who attempt to enter rebel-controlled territory.\nOn 12 July, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called an urgent emergency meeting with the heads of UN agencies. He stated after the meeting that immediate action must be taken to prevent the crisis from deepening. According to Ban, \"The human cost of this crisis is catastrophic. We cannot afford to wait.\" On 13 July, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees began a \"massive\" airlift of aid supplies to the Dadaab region in Kenya, including 100 tonnes of tents to help relieve the congestion at the overcrowded Dadaab camps. The United Nations carried out its first airlift of emergency supplies in two years to southern Somalia on Wednesday, 13 July. Health kits are also being sent through land routes. Among other measures being taken by aid agencies are the distribution of cash vouchers to residents, and discussions with traders to freeze rapidly increasing food prices.\nThe UN's declaration of famine has been its first since the 1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia, when over a million people died. Under international law, there is no mandated response which must follow from an official declaration of famine. However, it is hoped that the use of the term will serve as a \"wake-up call\" to the rest of the world, who have so far failed to respond. The UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, Mark Bowden, stated that UN agencies lack the necessary capacity to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of drought-affected people from Somalia, and that nearly $300\u00a0million in relief supplies are required over the next two months.\nOn 27 July, the UN World Food Programme announced that it had begun an airlift of food to Somalia. Ten tonnes of food were delivered to Mogadishu, with plans to expand delivery to southern Somalia where millions remain inaccessible, and may be too weak to cross the border into neighbouring Kenya. Delivery of food to the region remained complicated by the refusal of al-Shabaab militants to allow certain foreign aid agencies to work in the country.\nOn 25 Aug, a much delayed African Union summit raised $51\u00a0million of direct aid, some of which were perhaps announced before, along with an additional $300\u00a0million from the African Development Bank to be spent over a four-year period. The African Union is, however, a young organization with little humanitarian experience.\nOn 30 Aug, the UN refugee agency announced that the furniture corporation IKEA would be making a $62\u00a0million donation (42.8\u00a0million euros) over three years to expand the overcrowded Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya. The company CEO was quoted as saying that this donation will \"immediately make a difference\" in thousands of lives. In September 2011, during the UN General Assembly in NYC, USAID and the Ad Council launched the agency's first ever Public Service Awareness Campaign called FWD, an acronym for Famine, War and Drought. The Campaign encourages the public to \"Forward the Facts\" about the campaign to help raise awareness. In early Oct. 2011, the ONE Campaign unveiled a public service message in which celebrities appear to be cursing and then the message says that famine is the real obscenity.\nFifty-six African artists and celebrities, including Nameless, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, 2face Idibia, Hugh Masekela, Freshlyground and K'naan, as well as international campaigners, sent a letter to a special UN session on the horn of Africa crisis scheduled for Saturday 8 Oct.\nIn Sept. 2011, Rajiv Shah, head of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), stated \"We're trying cash distributions through the hawala system and through mobile phones and then concomitantly flooding border markets with food so that traders can then make the connections.\" Somalis in the diaspora have likewise routinely sent money to drought-affected relatives at home through the informal money transfer system. Part of this funding stream experienced a potential setback in December 2011, when Sunrise Community Banks, a U.S. financial institution that wires the transfers for many of the hawalas, announced that it might discontinue the service on 30 December due to overly strict government security regulations. Somali and American federal officials as well as representatives of the transfer companies have worked together closely to resolve the issue, with the CEO of the Sunrise Community Banks indicating that \"from a risk perspective, we are making progress, and I am optimistic that we are on the right path to get to a solution\". Kenyan expatriates have similarly availed themselves of mobile phone services to send funds to their own drought-impacted family members in Kenya.\nIn early 2012, the Turkish government ramped up its existing humanitarian and developmental efforts in southern Somalia. In coordination with the Somali authorities, it mobilized Turkish governmental organizations and NGOs to build new hospitals, a new relief center, and a tent city for remaining IDPs, which was scheduled to be converted into apartment flats. These and other proactive efforts have reportedly helped set in motion a rapid local recovery.\nUnited States Sanctions.\nUnder the US Patriot Act it is illegal for American organizations to provide aid to \"anyone associated with a terrorist group\". The Federal Agency responsible for enforcement of these sanctions is Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In February 2008, \"Al-Shabab\" had been added to the U.S. government's list of terrorist organizations. All deliveries of U.S. Food Aid were suspended in 2009 \"because of concerns over OFAC rules\" due to the possibility that some of the food aid could benefit \"al-Shabab\".\nDespite the approaching famine, no food aid was prepared for Somalia in fall 2011. Scholars have written:\nAid organizations faced strict regulations of food distribution by donors in an effort to deprive Al-Shabab of food for its own forces\"...OFAC imposed sanctions in Somalia to ensure that no material support, including food aid, would go to Al-Shabab in support of its rebel activities. Accountability requirements for food were so stringent that record keeping was not possible outside of the capital, Mogadishu.\nOFAC's rules were eventually relaxed, but the delay cost lives.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

{"id": "46809441", "revid": "30589093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46809441", "title": "Droughts in California", "text": "The historical and ongoing droughts in California result from various complex meteorological phenomena, some of which are not fully understood by scientists. \nDrought is generally defined as \"a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time (usually a season or more), resulting in a water shortage.\" \nA lack of rainfall (or snowfall) or precipitation in meager quantities, higher than average temperatures and dry air masses in the atmosphere commonly underlie drought conditions; these natural factors are further complicated by increases in populations and water demands. Since the California water supply is attained from numerous sources, fulfilled by varied and intricate weather patterns, there is no one cause of drought. California is not only the most populous state and largest agricultural producer in the United States, it is also the most biodiverse; as such, drought in California can have a far reaching economic and environmental impacts.\nThere are five major technical categories of drought: (1) Meteorological, (2) Agricultural, (3) Hydrological, (4) Socioeconomic, and (5) Ecological. A meteorological drought may be short lived without causing disturbance; but when longer lasting may enter other categories according to its impacts. In addition to technical categories, the Governor Newsom administration introduced in 2023 the concept of a political drought, where state public policy actions would need to continue even after short-term drought conditions may have ameliorated.\nPrecipitation in California occurs mostly from November to May, with the vast majority of rain and snowfall across the state occurring during the winter months. This delicate balance means that a dry rainy season can have lasting consequences.\nClimate.\nDrought is intrinsic to the natural climate of California. Across the Californian region, paleoclimate records dating back more than 1,000 years show more significant dry periods compared to the latest century. Ancient data reveals two mega-droughts that endured for well over a century, one lasting 220 years and one for 140 years. The 20th Century was fraught with numerous droughts, yet this era could be considered relatively \"wet\" compared against an expansive 3,500 year history. In recent times, droughts lasting five to 10 years have raised concern, but are not anomalous. Rather, decade long droughts are an ordinary feature of the state's innate climate. Based on scientific evidence, dry spells as severe as the mega-droughts detected from the distant past are likely to recur, even in absence of anthropogenic climate change.\nClimate change.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or IPCC, their Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) on the effects of climate change revealed a number of scientifically supported claims on what is to become the future of the earth. While variability in climate patterns are a natural occurrence, AR6 concluded that human influences have increased the chance of compound extreme weather events, specifically \"increases in the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale\" with high confidence.\nAccording to the NOAA Drought Task Force report of 2014, the drought is not part of a long-term change in precipitation and was a symptom of the natural variability, although the record-high temperature that accompanied the recent drought may have been amplified due to human-induced global warming. This was confirmed by a 2015 scientific study which estimated that global warming \"accounted for 8\u201327% of the observed drought anomaly in 2012\u20132014. Although natural variability dominates, anthropogenic warming has substantially increased the overall likelihood of extreme California droughts.\" A study published in 2016 found that the net effect of climate change has made agricultural droughts less likely, with the authors also stating that \"Our results indicate that the current severe impacts of drought on California\u2019s agricultural sector, its forests, and other plant ecosystems have not been substantially caused by long-term climate change.\"\nDrought phases are integral to the climate of California. Furthermore, global La Ni\u00f1a meteorological events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of droughts in California and the Southwestern and to some extent Southeastern United States. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Ni\u00f1as have become more frequent over time.\nIncreasingly dramatic fluctuations in California weather have been observed in the 21st century. In 2015, California experienced its lowest snowpack in at least 500 years; the 2012\u201315 period was the driest in at least 1200 years. However, the winter of 2016\u201317 was the wettest ever recorded in Northern California, surpassing the previous record set in 1982\u201383. In February 2017, Shasta, Oroville and Folsom Lakes were simultaneously dumping water into the ocean for flood control. Lake Oroville flowed over the emergency spillway for the first time in 48 years, after the main spillway was damaged resulting in the temporary evacuation of 200,000 people. The combined inflow to Shasta, Oroville and Folsom Lakes on February 9 was . Two days later, the combined flood control release was . This water would have been worth $370M at Los Angeles County municipal rates.\nDry years.\nThroughout recent recorded history, California has experienced periodic droughts, such as 1841, 1864, 1924, 1928\u20131935, 1947\u20131950, 1959\u20131960, 1976\u20131977, 1986\u20131992, 2006\u20132010, and 2011\u20132017, and 2020\u20132022.\nSince 1841, the following \"dry years\" have had significantly below-average precipitation.\n1841.\nThe drought was sufficiently severe that a settler's account of the time claimed that the Sonoma area was \"entirely unsuitable for agriculture\".\n1863\u20131864.\nThis drought was preceded by the torrential floods of 1861\u20131862.\n1924.\nThis drought encouraged farmers to start using irrigation more regularly. Because of the fluctuation in California weather, the need for consistent water availability was crucial for farmers.\n1928\u20131937.\nThis drought occurred during the historical Dust Bowl period that characterized much of the plains region of the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. \nThe Central Valley Project was started in the 1930s in response to drought.\n1950s.\nThe 1950s drought contributed to the creation of the State Water Project.\n1976\u201377.\n1977 had been the driest year in state history to date. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Drought in the 1970s spurred efforts at urban conservation and the state's Drought Emergency Water Bank came out of drought in the 1980s.\".\nAdditionally as drought prediction was essentially random and in response to recent severe drought years, in 1977 the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Water Research and Technology contracted Entropy Limited for an exploratory study of the applicability of the entropy minimax method of statistical analysis of multivariate data to the problem of determining the conditional probability of drought one or two years into the future, with the area of special interest being California. Christensen et al. (1980) demonstrated an information-theoretic model predicted the probability that precipitation will be below or above average with modest but statistically significant skill one, two and even three years into the future. It was this pioneering work that discovered the influence of El Nino El Nino-Southern Oscillation on US weather forecasting.\n1986\u20131992.\nCalifornia endured one of its longest droughts ever, observed from late 1986 through late 1992. Drought worsened in 1988 as much of the United States also suffered from severe drought. In California, the six-year drought ended in late 1992 as a significant El Ni\u00f1o event in the Pacific Ocean (and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991) most likely caused unusual persistent heavy rains.\n2007\u20132009.\n2007\u20132009 saw three years of drought conditions, the 12th worst drought period in the state's history, and the first drought for which a statewide proclamation of emergency was issued. The drought of 2007\u20132009 also saw greatly reduced water diversions from the state water project. The summer of 2007 saw some of the worst wildfires in Southern California history.\n2011\u20132017.\n2011-2017 was the longest drought in California beginning December 2011 and ending March 2017. \nThe period between late 2011 and 2014 was the driest in California history since record-keeping began. In May 2015, a state resident poll conducted by Field Poll found that two out of three respondents agreed that it should be mandated for water agencies to reduce water consumption by 25%.\nThe 2015 prediction of El Ni\u00f1o to bring rains to California raised hopes of ending the drought. In the spring of 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration named the probability of the presence of El Ni\u00f1o conditions until the end of 2015 at 80%. Historically, El Ni\u00f1o conditions were present during sixteen winters between 1951 and 2015. Six of those had below-average rainfall, five had average rainfall, and five had above-average rainfall. However, as of May 2015, drought conditions had worsened and above average ocean temperatures had not resulted in large storms.\nThe drought led to Governor Jerry Brown's instituting mandatory 25 percent water restrictions in June 2015.\nMany millions of California trees died from the drought \u2013 approximately 102 million, including 62 million in 2016 alone. By the end of 2016, 30% of California had emerged from the drought, mainly in the northern half of the state, while 40% of the state remained in the extreme or exceptional drought levels. Heavy rains in January 2017 were expected to have a significant benefit to the state's northern water reserves, despite widespread power outages and erosional damage in the wake of the deluge. Among the casualties of the rain was 1,000 year-old Pioneer Cabin Tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park, which toppled on January 8, 2017.\nThe winter of 2016\u201317 turned out to be the wettest on record in Northern California, surpassing the previous record set in 1982\u201383. Floodwaters caused severe damage to Oroville Dam in early February, prompting the temporary evacuation of nearly 200,000 people north of Sacramento. In response to the heavy precipitation, which flooded multiple rivers and filled most of the state's major reservoirs, Governor Brown declared an official end to the drought on April 7.\nEffects.\nShort-term effects.\nThe runoff from rainfall used to support many aspects of California infrastructure, such as agriculture and municipal use, will be severely diminished during the drought. While groundwater diminishes at a much lower rate than runoff, the lack of runoff will lead to increased groundwater pumping to meet the needs of the water demand. If groundwater is being pumped at a rate higher than it can be replenished by precipitation then groundwater levels will begin to fall and the quality of water will also decrease. With that said the relationship between surface water and groundwater contribute to the hydrologic system, and groundwater helps maintain surface water flows during extended dry periods. With both sources diminishing, the quality and availability of water will decrease. People can become ill from lack of water.\nLong-term effects.\nExcessive ground water pumping and aquifer depletion will lead to land sinking and permanent loss of groundwater storage. Decreasing groundwater levels lead to exposing of underground water storage areas, this will cause lack of soil structure strength and possible sinking if the land above is heavy enough. This has already begun in certain parts of the state during the most recent drought. In coastal communities, excessive water pumping can lead to sea water intrusion, which means sea water will begin to flow into the underground water storage areas that were vacated by excess pumping. This can cause decreased water quality and lead to an expensive desalination effort to clean the water before distribution. Water flows through wildlife refuges and national parks can decrease or stop all together due to the decrease of surface and groundwater, the California Water Science Center is a part of a team trying to restore and maintain water flow in these at risk areas. With reduction of water flow and increased windy or dry weather, wildfire risks increase; lightning strikes or accidental human mistake can lead to huge wildfires due to the drier-than-normal climate.\nPossible adaptations.\nAdaptation is the process of adjusting to circumstances, which means not trying to stop the drought, but trying to preserve the water given the drought conditions. This is the most used option, because stopping a drought is difficult given that it is a meteorological process. Adapting to the problem using innovation and problem solving is often the cheaper and more useful way to go because trying to change the natural processes of the earth could have unforeseen consequences.\nInfrastructure issues.\nA precipitation shortage leaves less water in the state's water infrastructure systems, leading to debates on how to best make use of this limited resource.\nLack of new infrastructure.\nVery few large-scale water projects have been built since 1979, despite the population doubling since that year.\nInefficient distribution systems.\nBecause much of California's water network relies on a system of pumps to move water from north to south, large volumes of water are often lost to the Pacific Ocean during winter storms when river flow exceeds the capacity of the pumps. This is further complicated by environmental rules which restrict pumping during certain months of the year, to protect migrating fish. In water year 2015, of water flowed through the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta, but only were recovered into water distribution systems.\nReservoir capacity reserved for flood control.\nMost of California's major reservoirs serve important flood control functions. Due to the limited capacity of river channels and dam spillways, reservoirs cannot be quickly drained before major storms. This limits how much of a reservoir's capacity can be used for long-term storage. Reservoirs in California are designed to control either rain floods, snowmelt floods or both.\nIn the coastal and southern parts of the state, and much of the Sacramento River system, the primary threat is rain floods in the November\u2013April wet season. Oceanic \"atmospheric river\" or Pineapple Express storms can generate massive precipitation in a short period (often up to 50\u00a0percent of the total annual rainfall in just a few storms). This requires a certain safety margin to be maintained in reservoirs, which are often not allowed to capacity until late April or May. Shasta Lake, California's largest reservoir, is limited to approximately 71\u00a0percent of capacity in the winter in order to control rain flooding. Levees along Northern California rivers, such as the Sacramento and American rivers, are quite generously sized in order to pass large volumes of floodwater.\nIn the San Joaquin River basin (San Joaquin Valley) and other areas of the state where snowpack is the primary source of river flow, river channels are sized mainly to control snowmelt floods, which do not produce the huge peaks typical of rain floods, but are longer in duration and have a much higher total volume. As a result, reservoirs in this region have very strict restrictions on the amount of water that can be released. An example of a reservoir operated for snow floods is Pine Flat Lake near Fresno, which is restricted to about 53\u00a0percent capacity well into spring in order to capture summer snowmelt. However, Pine Flat and other San Joaquin reservoirs are frequently ineffectual in controlling rain floods, because they cannot release water fast enough between winter storms.\nCertain parts of the state, especially in the central Sierra Nevada, are prone to both rain and snow floods. Reservoirs such as Lake Oroville and Folsom Lake must respond to a wider range of runoff conditions. Lake Oroville is typically limited to 79\u201389\u00a0percent of capacity during the winter and Folsom Lake to 33\u201360\u00a0percent. These values are often adjusted up and down based on the amount of rain and snow forecast. At Folsom Lake, due to the small size of the reservoir, it is difficult to balance the need for winter flood-control space with the need to store water for the summer. This often results in a failure to fill the lake due to a lower than expected spring snowmelt. Water managers and hydrology experts have criticized the outdated, overly conservative operation criteria at Folsom Dam, citing improved weather forecasting and snowpack measurement technology.\nProgress in forecasting methods has allowed more efficient or \"smart\" operation at certain California reservoirs, such as Lake Mendocino. If dry weather is forecast, water is allowed to be stored above the legal flood control limit, rather than being wasted downstream. This program is known as \"Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations\". In addition, capital improvements such as the $900 million spillway project at Folsom Dam will allow greater flexibility in water releases, making it safer to maintain a high reservoir level during the wet season.\nWeather cycles.\nCalifornia has one of the most variable climates of any U.S. state, and often experiences very wet years followed by extremely dry ones. The state's reservoirs have insufficient capacity to balance the water supply between wet and dry years.\nEl Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a have often been associated with wet and dry cycles in California, respectively (the 1982\u201383 El Ni\u00f1o event, one of the strongest in history, brought record precipitation to the state), but recent climate data show mixed evidence for such a relationship due in part to the growing impact of human-induced global warming. The very wet 2010\u20132011 season occurred during a strong La Ni\u00f1a phase, while the 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event, which surpassed 1982\u201383 in intensity, did not bring an appreciable increase of precipitation to the state.\nThe 2012\u201315 North American drought was caused by conditions of the Arctic oscillation and North Atlantic oscillation which removed storms from the U.S. in the winter of 2011\u20132012.\nFlow Augmentation.\nMeeting EPA water quality standards currently requires allowing billions of gallons per day to flow into the ocean.\nOn March 20, 2023, Trinity Lake was losing 1 billion gallons per day to Flow Augmentation. This happened during historic drought, while Trinity was at only 50% of historical average, and all other major California lakes were at least 91% of historical average. The Trinity River Restoration Program is responsible for regulating the flow.\nSupply and demand.\nWater in California can be expensive.\nThis leads to awareness of water management challenges.\nIn some instances, water tables underground have dropped from 100 to 400\u2013600 feet deep, basically shutting off most private well owners from their own water sources.\nTreating water as a commodity.\nWater is managed by government consent, which assumes ownership and management of all free flowing rivers, lakes, and bodies of water in its jurisdictions. In many cases in the US, water has been used for commercial purposes, such as Nestle's 72 brands of bottled water. It is managed by governmental authorities selling its water rights. Some local and state governments have resorted to selling water rights for income even when it harms the local community and environment (e.g. taking water away from California and bottling and shipping it to water-rich parts of the United States and the world for profit). This has led many to criticize treating water as a commodity.\nDespite Nestle's claims of acting according to the law, however, in 2017 California authorities found that the company extracted 58 million gallons, far surpassing the 2.3 million gallons per year it had rights to claim. Lately, locals have been fighting back against the \"stealing\" of precious resources by opposing and not allowing huge water draw down facilities to be set up. For example, officials at California's State Water Resources Control Board have made moves to prevent Nestl\u00e9 from draining millions of gallons of water from the San Bernardino National Forest. Nestle's continued bottling in the forest after its permit to do so was expired by decades. In doing so, Nestle depleted Strawberry Creek.\nAnother bottled water company, Crystal Geyser, was found to be illegally transporting and dumping arsenic-laded wastewater from its bottling facilities.\nWater independence.\nOrange County is working toward water independence by building the world's largest indirect potable water recycling project \u2013 the Groundwater Replenishment System. Poseidon Water is also developing a seawater desalination plant in Huntington Beach for Orange County and has already built and is operating a seawater desalination plant in Carlsbad for San Diego County. Combined the two plants will provide 100 million gallons of drinking water per day, or enough water for about 800,000 people.", "matches": ["droughts"], "label": []}

He wrote the stories by detailing out the projects as well as the lives of villagers living in these places, supplementing them with detailed statistics.\nDivided into separate sections based on the issues that the chapters deal with, the book scathingly unveils how trickle up and down theories do not work in reality in the country, and the stunningly high levels of corruption in so called development projects.\nThe book is considered one of the most detailed, authentic, highly regarded and readable studies of 1980s rural India.\nTo make rural stories more accessible, excerpts from the book have been also published on People's Archive of Rural India.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Low snowfall amounts in winter, coupled with the intense summer heat from La Ni\u00f1a, caused drought-like conditions to migrate northward from the southern United States, wreaking havoc on crops and water supply. The drought inflicted significant economic ramifications for the affected states. It exceeded, in many measures, the 1988\u20131989 North American drought, the most recent comparable drought.\nThe drought affected most of the U.S., parts of Mexico, and central and Eastern Canada. At its peak in July 2012, it covered approximately 81 percent of the contiguous United States with at least abnormally dry (D0) conditions. Out of that 81%, 64% was designated as at least moderate drought (D1) conditions. Its area was comparable to the droughts in the 1930s and 1950s.\nDrought continued in parts of North America through 2013. Beginning in March 2013, improved rainfall across the Midwest, southern Mississippi Valley, and Great Plains began gradually alleviating drought in these areas, while drought continued to intensify in the Western United States. Heavy rains across previously drought-stricken areas resulted in widespread flooding in portions of the Midwest, a phenomenon which was named \"weather whiplash\". By June 2013, approximately the eastern half of the United States was drought-free, while conditions continued to gradually improve across the Plains. Moderate to severe drought continues to impact and worsen throughout the western United States, with some portions of the United States being afflicted by the drought for over three years. Through the winter of 2013\u20132014, California continued to receive record low rainfall. For many locations, the calendar year of 2013 was the driest year in over 130 years. Some locations received less than half of their previous record low rainfall amounts.\nMeteorological background.\nThe drought was set in motion when strongly positive Arctic oscillation and North Atlantic oscillation conditions removed winter storms from the U.S. the winter of 2011\u20132012. When spring arrived, very little snow existed to melt and moisten the ground, and thus very little water to evaporate and create rainfall. The effects of the lack of snow were immediate. Dry conditions could be noticed immediately, and contributed to a weak tornado season in the U.S. The strongest tornado outbreak of 2012 occurred on March 2, after most snow had melted. The drought continued to steadily intensify along with a decline in rainfall which is still ongoing. The Summer 2012 North American heat wave caused further evaporation of groundwater, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers and streams.\nAs moisture has continued to decline, the conditions are becoming self-sustaining (i.e. a lack of rainfall means that less moisture is available to promote additional rainfall, in a vicious cycle). In many areas, the only way for drought conditions to be significantly alleviated in the short-term would be for a discrete, long-lived, and large system (such as a tropical cyclone) to impact the area. Soil hardening due to the drought means that even if a large amount of rain falls in a short time, most of it will run off quickly causing flash floods rather than drought relief. The June 2012 North American derecho and other strong storms in late June and early July did not appear to ease drought conditions, as the rainwater ran off rapidly from the affected areas.\nThe drought continued and intensified into the end of November 2014 for a large part of the country. Although drought/dry conditions are likely to drop at least one category level in the Southwest, Southeast, Northeast, and Northern Plains as well as portions of the Ohio River Valley, it is expected to have both short-term and long-term impacts across nearly the entire affected area.\nA study by Utah State University analyzed the 2011 Missouri River Flooding and predicted that \"a prominent teleconnection forcing in driving the wet/dry spells in the (Missouri River Basin)... implies persistence of dry conditions for the next 2 to 3 years\", which coincides with the 2012\u201315 drought. That analysis was based upon a marked variability at the 10\u201315-\u2009year time scale that is coincident with the water storage increase in the Missouri River Basin. The study found that precipitation over the MRB undergoes a profound modulation during the transition points of the Pacific quasi-decadal oscillation and associated teleconnections.\nImpacts.\nUnited States.\nThe drought cost more than $35 billion in the Midwest, and may have reduced the gross domestic product by 0.5\u20131% of the U.S. as a whole, equating to a loss of $75 to $150 billion.\nCrops, particularly strains grown in the most heavily affected regions (such as corn and soybeans), were noted to be failing or yielding very low in 2012 due to the drought's presence in farming areas. This increase in cost moved up the feeding chain and resulted in raised prices for meat, dairy, and processed food products.Food prices increased as a result of the consequent supply shortfall. The price of farm equipment, on the other hand, decreased as farmers were forced to sell off their equipment and machinery to cope with decreased incomes.\nWater levels on parts of the Mississippi River plummeted, affecting trade and commerce.\n1,692 counties across 36 states in the U.S. were legally declared primary natural disaster areas in August 2012 as the drought covered over 62% of the contiguous U.S. Hundreds of additional counties bordering the primary disaster areas were designated as \"contiguous\" disaster areas, and are also eligible for federal aid.\nThe number of cattle in the U.S. decreased to the lowest in 60 years due to drought impacts, with 69% of cattle located in areas that faced drought conditions.\nCalifornia.\nCalifornia had been experiencing a drought since 2011. In 2013 the total rainfall was less than 34% of what was expected. Many regions of the state accumulated less rainfall in 2013 than any other year on record. As a result of this, many fish species were threatened. Streams and rivers were so low that fish couldn't get to their spawning grounds, and survival rates of any eggs that are laid were expected to be low. Lack of rainfall had caused the mouths of rivers to be blocked off by sand bars which further prevents fish from reaching their spawning grounds. Stafford Lehr, Chief of Fisheries within the California Department of Fish and Wildlife says that 95% of winter run salmon didn't survive in 2013. Not only did the drought severely affect fishing, but also agriculture. Decreasing rainfall amounts and increasing temperatures cause agriculture to be much more challenging due to increasing rates of evapotranspiration.\nIn response to heightening drought conditions, California tightened fishing restrictions in many areas of the state. Streams and rivers on the northern coast had unprecedented amounts of fishing bans. In February 2015 the California Fish and Game Commission voted unanimously to further tighten regulations on both recreational and commercial fishing. The U.S. Endangered Species Act listed steelhead as threatened and coho salmon as endangered. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife closed dozens of streams and rivers to fishing in 2014. Lehr said that he fears coho salmon may go completely extinct south of the Golden Gate Bridge in the near future. In early 2014 the main stems of the Eel, Mad, Smith, Van Duzen, and Mattole rivers were closed pending additional rainfall. Large areas of the Russian and American rivers were closed indefinitely. Most rivers in San Mateo, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties were also closed pending further rainfall. Other actions were also taken, such as releasing more water from the Kent Dam in hopes of raising the levels in the Lagunitas Creek watershed \u2013 one of the last spawning grounds that wild coho can still reach.\nProtesters said that banning fishing will disrupt the economy and threaten the livelihoods of individuals who rely on salmon fishing during the winters. Officials felt that it will help prevent species that are already in trouble from slipping to extinction.\nCanada.\nThe drought affected Canada mainly in the east in Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces where there was record setting heat and very little rainfall. Summer crops in these areas were affected and the price of produce, particularly corn and soybeans, was expected to increase.\nSee also.\nConcurrent and related weather events\nOther widespread severe droughts", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

Countries included in this region are Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea. Droughts in the Sahel occur quite often and tend to reduce the already meager water supply and stress the economies of developing countries in that region.\nFuture droughts of the Sahel region.\nThe droughts are becoming increasingly more common, worse and more threatening due to global warming. A possible explanation to the aridity trend is the supplements of an oceanography phenomenon called El Ni\u00f1o. An idea is that evaporation is occurring at higher rate due to the change in Sea surface temperature, this then impacts the amount of rain the Sahel region receives Another factor to keep into consideration is the response of our atmosphere to stimulants like greenhouse gases and carbon emissions.\nSocietal impacts.\nMass famine.\nValerie Amos, UN Humanitarian Chief during 2012, released a statement during the year stating that over 15 million people were malnourished in West Africa and the Sahel region. The main contributor to the famine was the drought of Sahel, ensued from a combination of failing crops and El Ni\u00f1o.\nMauritania and Chad recorded a loss in crop yield of over 50% when compared to 2011. Food reserves in the areas affected were very low and combined with corn prices soaring by 60-85% compared to averages over the last five years.

Denver was forced to impose water restrictions for the first time in over 20\u00a0years. The drought of 2002 had a negative impact in many states.\nAs usually happens during dry spells in the eastern United States, the 2002 drought was caused by a westward extension of the semi-permanent Bermuda High, which resulted in a continuous flow of hot south-southwesterly air north and caused the storm track to be pushed well off to the west. The density of the Bermuda High also kept hot air at ground level and prevented the formation of convective clouds. The Midwestern states and Mississippi Valley for contrast had a quite wet summer as most rainfall from frontal systems fell in that region. This was much the same weather pattern as the earlier 1999 North American drought, but in 2002 a secondary and unusual event happened when a high pressure system formed over the Gulf of Mexico, a rare occurrence during the summer months. This further blocked the flow of Gulf moisture northward. Precipitation deficits were greatest from New Jersey southward to Georgia and less so in New York and New England with the Great Lakes states and the Mississippi watershed being unusually wet. A shift to an El Nino pattern in fall 2002 brought about wetter, cooler conditions for much of 2003-04 which erased the precipitation deficits from the 1998-02 drought events.\nCanada.\nThe drought of 2002 also ravaged certain parts of Canada, particularly Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

The drought involved numerous states in the Midwest and the Great Plains. As well, many states experienced a heat wave in the summer months, with temperatures over or higher in multiple areas. Later in 1983 and the two following years, dry conditions began affecting south-central Canada as well, particularly Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The drought may have been caused under a weak-to-moderate La Ni\u00f1a which might have developed during mid-spring of 1983.\nMidwestern States.\nAlmost all the counties in the State of Indiana and many in Illinois were given a drought disaster declaration because of dangerous heat spells, along with extremely dry conditions. In Kentucky, the Drought of 1983 was second to worst in the 20th century. Numerous trees and shrubs went into dormancy.\nNortheastern States.\nDry conditions also affected parts of the Middle Atlantic between 1983 and 1985. The drought, especially in 1983 \u2013 1985, affected Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, parts of New England and eastern New York State.\nCanada.\nIn parts of south-central Canada between spring 1983 to early Autumn 1985, drought led to substandard crops, primarily in Alberta, Manitoba and several regions of Saskatchewan.

Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky were pummeled by severe heat which killed several hundred people.

It is considered as the region's worst drought in 40 years. The worst-hit areas in Maharashtra were Solapur, Parbhani, Ahmednagar, Latur, Pune, Satara, Beed and Nashik. Residents of Latur, Osmanabad, Nanded, Aurangabad, Jalna, Jalgaon and Dhule districts were also affected by this famine.\nGeographical and physical impact.\nIn January 2013, the Indian government reported that 7,896 villages in Maharashtra were affected by drought. In a region near the Bhima River in Maharashtra, the years leading up to the drought in 2013 recorded below average annual rainfall: in 2011, slightly below average, and in 2012, the lowest since 2003. In May 2013, the lowest groundwater levels were recorded since May 2005. The low rainfall and groundwater appears to have been worsened by improper water resource management. \nWith approximately 80% of drinking water sources in Maharashtra dependent on ground water sources, the drought led to a situation of drinking water scarcity in Maharashtra. The drought also negatively affected agriculture, decreasing production of staple foods, ranging from 5-21%, as compared to the previous year. This decreased production led to an increase in food prices across India and a decrease of India\u2019s GDP by 0.5% (9 billion USD) in 2012.\nOf 223 farming households surveyed, over 60% reported crop losses and over 20% reported loss of livestock because of the drought. Multiple farmers moved to urban areas in search in work. Others effectively used reserves of food, water and money to survive.\nResponse.\nGovernment.\nThe Indian government allocated almost half of its disaster budget to relief efforts. The Government's Empowered Group of Ministers provided INR \u20b912.07 billion for relief, including 2,136 water tankers supplying 1,663 villages. However, due to increased numbers of starving livestock, a further INR \u20b911.6 billion was allocated to the agricultural sector for scarcity mitigation, supplying water and fodder. There was criticism of the government regarding water allocation, with disproportionate quantities being used to grow sugarcane in Maharashtra. The government was also criticized for its lack of regulation to prevent future droughts. Following the drought, the government committed to improving the maintenance of dams, rivers and other infrastructure. \nNon-Profit.\nThe Yuva Foundation (formerly: Maharashtra Drought Relief Project) was a youth-led initiative set up by Soham Sawalkar and Aditya Sureka to assist in the drought response. They distributed food, water and fodder, as well as providing materials such as PVC pipes to install water solutions for villages.\nIn June 2013, Church Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA), the humanitarian and development arm of Indian Churches, announced their plans to assist in the relief efforts by aiming to raise USD $264,504 from donors. This included the provision of livestock fodder, manure and seeds, agricultural and advocacy training programs, and raising water management and disaster risk reduction awareness.\nConsequences.\nNutrition, sanitation, water.\nWith a significant decrease in agricultural yield except for milk, oil seeds and cotton production, food security was a concern. A study of 223 households found that just over half of the respondents had access to water for sanitation while 83.8% of the 66.4% who had access to toilets, used them. While priority was given to providing water quantity over quality, water samples tested detected beyond permissible limits of nitrate-nitrogen, ammonium-nitrogen, and chlorides. \u00a0\nMental health.\nDue to the stress and burden of economic losses faced by farmers, specifically along the cotton belt, suicide rates increased between 2011-2015 (1,495-2,016 deaths). However, in 2013 this trend reversed due to adequate rainfall in the second half of the year (1,298). With the continuing drought-like conditions following 2012-2013, suicide among farmers continues to have a devastating effect. Maharashtra has become known as the `graveyard of farmers\u00b4. \nOther: migration, education, desertification process.\nWith water scarcity and loss of employment, seasonal and permanent migration increased, usually towards urban cities. Five hundred thousand workers migrated from Marathwada to western Maharashtra. Water collection was usually done by women and children, which was exacerbated by the drought and migration of men, in turn decreasing children\u00b4s attendance in school. The desertification process, including recurring droughts, is a long-term consequence that could severely impact future societies and human health. ", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

From 1850 to 1980, the frequency of this high-pressure system, Azores High, was once every seven years. But data has shown that after 1980 the frequency became once every four years. The problem of the Azores high is that it reduces about one third of the monthly rainfall in the winters (Carrington, 2022). \nSince the industrial revolution, the Azores high, which is also called the \"Gatekeeper\" of European Rainfall has become more frequent. Research has shown that the Azores High has expanded as the earth has warmed (Tandon, 2022). The expansion of the Azores High will intensify the drought in Portugal and Spain, and it's expected that these two regions will see a 10-20% drop in winter precipitation in upcoming winters (Tandon, 2022).

The dry spell in May 2011 was also said to be the worst period of drought in Texas since 1895. The U.S. Drought Monitor reported that Lubbock, Texas has experienced the nation's worst average level of drought since the beginning of 2011. McAllen, Harlingen, Brownsville and Corpus Christi also ranked among the nine U.S. cities most affected by extreme drought. The drought in Texas caused an estimated $7.62 billion in crop and livestock losses, surpassing the previous record loss of $4.1 billion set in 2006.\nHistory.\nThe drought began due to a strong La Ni\u00f1a developing by the summer of 2010 which brings below average rainfall to the southern United States. The effects of the La Ni\u00f1a could be noticed immediately as much of the south receives important rainfall during the summer, and this was the driest summer for Texas and Georgia in the 21st century thus far, and much of the south received record low rainfall.\nThroughout 2011, the drought was confined to the Deep South as the mid-south received flooding due to severe weather and tornadoes. However, the drought continued and intensified in the Deep South as Texas saw 2011 become its second-driest year on record, Oklahoma saw its fourth-driest, and Georgia saw its seventh-driest year on record. The winter of 2011\u201312 was one of the driest winters on record for the eastern and central United States. In the spring of 2012, the drought made a massive expansion from the Deep South to the Midwest, Mid-south, Great Plains, and Ohio valley. At its peak in August 2012 the drought covered approximately 81% of the United States. Throughout the winter of 2012\u201313, heavy rain and snow brought relief to the drought in the southern and eastern United States, even causing severe flooding. By March 2013, the eastern United States was drought-free, effectively ending the 2010\u201313 southern U.S. drought. Drought continued on the Great Plains until 2014. However, drought developed in the western United States in 2013 and still exists today in some areas.\nEffects.\nThe drought caused severe lack of water in the southern plains and Rocky Mountains as well as numerous wildfires, in particular the 2011 Texas wildfires, the Wallow Fire and Horseshoe 2 Fire in Arizona, the Whitewater-Baldy Complex Fire and Little Bear Fire in New Mexico, and the 2012 Colorado wildfires in Colorado. Mexico also saw serious impact from the drought which decimated crops, killed over a million cattle, and stressed local water and food supplies. The drought has been described as the worst seen in the country in 70 years.\nBy the end of August 2011, a ban on outdoor burning was in effect for 251 of the 254 Texas counties. Lake levels in Texas had declined vastly, some by as much as 50 feet; E.V. Spence Reservoir was only 1% full. This revealed various previously submerged items, ranging from a Native American's skull to a Space Shuttle Columbia tank. On August 30, several homes in Oklahoma City were destroyed along with 1,500 wooded acres. Hundreds of homes had to be evacuated.\nThe drought had a detrimental effect on Texas and Oklahoma cattle ranches, who deeply culled their herds and helped cut the national cattle population to the lowest level in decades.\n2012 spring rainfall improved conditions in many parts of Texas and by April 12, 2012, only 14% of the state was in \"exceptional\" drought, compared to 88% at the drought's peak.\nIn spring and summer of 2012, the drought expanded and formed the 2012 North American drought, affecting more than 80% of the contiguous United States.\nIn Texas.\nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a joint effort of the National Drought Mitigation Center, the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as of late November 2012, about 4 percent of Texas remained in \"extreme\" or \"exceptional\" drought, the two most severe categories.\nThe drought caused billions of dollars in losses throughout the state economy. Farmers and ranchers were among those hardest hit. The Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Service estimates that Texas agricultural producers lost nearly $7.6 billion due to the drought.\nDrought and unprecedented heat made 2011 the worst year for wildfires in Texas history. From Nov. 15, 2010 through Sept. 29, 2011, Texas saw 23,835 fires that burned more than 3.8 million acres and destroyed 2,763 Texas homes.

After weeks of drought, the town's reservoirs started to fall below their normal levels. Precipitation totals since the beginning of July had been half of what they usually were and temperatures were higher than normal. The Atkins Reservoir in nearby Shutesbury was six feet below normal, while the Hills Reservoir in nearby Pelham was thirteen feet below normal, with its output reduced by half. A third reservoir in the same town was two and a half feet under normal levels.\nOn August 31, the school opened for the fall semester and students began arriving on campus. Labor Day weekend brought more challenges to the system, as temperatures climbed into the 80s and demand for water by Labor Day soared to , more than the previous record. Normally, the school uses half of the that the town produces in an average day.\nBy Tuesday, Amherst Town Manager Louis Hayward had a dilemma. Compounding the problem was the fact that in South Amherst, construction of a new well in Lawrence Swamp was still at least a month from completion. This issue then caused the Amherst Board of Selectmen on the following Monday to declare a water emergency, with the aim of cutting water usage by one quarter by banning all outside use of water. Additionally, authorization was given to selectman to approach the neighboring town of Hadley and purchase water from them. University officials were also placed on a state of alert and asked to cut back water use, something that was asked for two years earlier by the school when they put up signs asking students to help with water conservation. During the morning, the fire department was also notified by the town's department of public works to the fact that alarms on the town's four storage tanks were showing signs that levels had dropped to forty feet, well below the normal level of sixty-two feet. This caused an increase in pumping of water into the tanks.\nThe first signs of trouble came the next morning when a resident of William M. Cashin House on the northern end of campus called the school's maintenance to report low water levels. A plumber was dispatched and, after checking that the filters weren't clogged, determined it was a supply problem. A call was placed into the local water department. By early afternoon, notices were posted in the dorm advising students on the fifth through eighth floors that there was no water available. Complaints began to trickle in from the Sylvan, Orchard Hill, and Central Residential Areas. All these dorms were on a hill relative to the rest of campus. Health services then went out to local markets and purchased distilled water and secured two fifty-five gallon drums from a Holyoke company.\nEventually, plumbers were dispatched to shut off water, first to the individual floors, then entire buildings. By six that night, the Physical Plant director alerted Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance George Beatty about the impending crisis. Around forty five minutes later, the town manager was notified of the problem. Around this time, water shortages were beginning to be noticed in the Southwest Residential Area. In the Mildred Pierpont House, toilets wouldn't stop flushing, a consequence of low water pressure. By 9:30 that night, about 3,000 students were without water. Chancellor Henry Koffler returned from meetings in Boston and was subsequently warned by Beatty that if the pressure continued to drop, the steam plant would have to be shut down, and research projects, air conditioning, and electrical systems would also have to be turned off. All of this would prove costly. By this time, students were travelling to Puffers Pond in North Amherst to clean up. The chancellor was also urged by Hayward to close the campus.\nIn a last-ditch effort an hour and a half later, water was ordered shut off to the Southwest Residential Area, which contained 5,600 residents at the time. Water service to the John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center, Herter, and Tobin Halls, as well as the showers at the Boyden Gym, were also shut off. Reports from the night state that some students began to hoard water in pails before the taps were shut off. By four the next morning, it was determined that the shutdown of water to the area had no effect and so service was restored. As a result of people leaving the faucets on, the bathrooms flooded when service was restored.\nShutdown and evacuation.\nAt 7:30 that morning, the Chancellor Henry Koffler convened a meeting and reluctantly announced plans to shut down the campus. At ten, campus representatives were informed of the plan, where the only business going on at the school would be \"urgent business\". Additionally, air conditioning would no longer run at the school. By noon, the campus would close, and, according to notices sent to residence halls, \"All students are to leave Amherst as quickly as possible. Only the most difficult cases are to be allowed as exceptions.\" By the end of the day, seventy percent of the taps in forty-one dorms on campus were dry.\nAs a result of the campus now being closed, the town of Amherst activated an emergency well on Bay Road, South Amherst, as well as beginning to tap into Hadley's water system. Officials were briefly encouraged when tank levels rose from zero to twenty-one feet by nine that morning, but two hours later, levels began to drop again. As a result of the low water pressure, firefighters began taking a one thousand gallon tanker truck with them when they went on calls.\nThe mass evacuation of people called for an armada of transportation to suit the needs of students. As a result of this, officials arranged for a group of buses that would transport students to Worcester, Natick, and Boston, beginning at two that afternoon. Calls were soon received from people as far away as Enfield, Connecticut, offering to house the temporarily displaced students. The chancellor even offered to house students, until he realized that his house, perched on the side of Orchard Hill, was also without water. Eventually, the school's transit service set up tables in the Southwest, Sylvan, and Central residential areas to sell bus tickets to the students. The resulting scene was later described as a \"madhouse\" by a ticket seller. People who were unable to pay were told that if they supplied their student number, they would be billed later. While one report states that fifty buses were used in the evacuation, another one states that fifty-five buses were used that day.\nThe mood of the remaining students began to turn festive as a result of them not being affected by water shortages. According to \"The Daily Collegian\", the campus newspaper, several fraternity and sorority organizations began to plan \"shower parties\", which involved a lot of beer. According to the Boston Globe, two liquor stores in town reported brisk sales to students. By late afternoon, the campus was largely deserted of the 11,000 students that had lived there.\nOfficial response.\nGovernor Edward J. King, who was visiting a fair in nearby Northampton, instructed the state police to begin to patrol the now empty campus to deter looters. The campus also promised to beef up police presence. As the campus remained in twenty four-hour lockdown, only six hundred students remained on campus, including three hundred international students in Walter E. Prince Hall, and three hundred and sixty residential assistants. Some student athletes also remained behind. The national guard also brought in eight tanks of water and purchased hundreds of empty cider jugs from a local farm. The dining commons also switched to paper plates and plastic utensils and water was shut off to the dorms by the Physical Plant.\nReturn to normalcy.\nSoon after, the town began to refill its tanks and bring new supplies online. Campus officials began to plan to have students back on campus on Sunday. Inevitably, a blame game ensued between town and campus officials, but eventually this settled down as focus shifted on bringing students back. Students were also reimbursed for room and dining commons. Depending on their meal plan, students were reimbursed between $22.89 and $26.76. A plan by the president of the Student Government Association to charter fifteen busses was turned down. Bathrooms were also cleaned and disinfected to allow for students to come back, and an extension of the add-drop deadline was announced. One entrepreneuing student who stayed behind began to hawk \"UMass Evacuation\" T-shirts, which showed a dripping faucet labeled \"Amherst DPW\". All one hundred and sixty-eight shirts were sold within two hours.\nAftermath.\nClasses resumed on the next Monday. Town officials then tried to figure out how the crisis developed and why the town manager was never told of the shortage of water. The town also continued to borrow water and use an emergency well until another one was opened up at the end of September. In an interview, the head of the new Amherst Town Water Conservation Project, Chuck Lacey, said, \"We are a small town with small reservoirs and if it doesn't rain for six weeks they dry up. We've been taking a gamble for years with the expansion of the university.\" Paul Godfrey, head of the Water Resources Research Center at the University of Massachusetts Amherst said that, \"...the problem has been coming at us for 15 years. The university kept expanding but nobody did anything about the water.", "matches": ["water shortage"], "label": []}

According to Graham Phillips, this film is one of the most damaged films in Australia's film archive, although few sequences have severe damage in the film.\nPlot.\nDrought causes Jo Galloway to lose possession of Wallaby Stationn to the bank. He moves to the city with his wife and daughter Marjorie to stay with his son Gilbert only to discover that Gilbert has been embezzling family funds, and fallen in with conman Varsy Lyddleton and femme fatal Olive Lorette.\nLyddleton murders Olive then kills himself. Marjorie's boyfriend Tom Wattleby saves Gilbert from a bushfire, just as the drought breaks, restoring the family's fortunes.\nOriginal Play.\nThe film was based on a 1902 Australian play written for Bland Holt by English playwright Arthur Shirley.\nSynopsis.\nIn 1902, at drought-stricken Wallaby Station in New South Wales, a squatter, Jo Galloway, lives with his wife and daughter Marjorie while his son Gilbert trains to be a doctor in Sydney. Gilbert falls in with bad company, in the shape of financier Varsey Lyddleton, who encourages him to forge his father's name on some cheques and ruins his family. A neighbouring squatter, Tom Wattleby, who loves Marjorie Galloway, returns from a trip to India to find the father working as a lamp cleaner and the daughter was a maid. The neighbour rescues the family and the father swears vengeance on his son. However, during a bush fire that ends in a heavy rain that breaks the drought, the hero rescues Gilbert.\nReception.\nThe play made its debut at the end of 1902 and was very popular. Audiences and critics were particularly impressed by the stage design, which included things like real horses, recreations of Paddy's Market, swimming pools and real trees.\nAnnette Kellerman appeared in a 1903 production.\nHolt later adapted another play of Shirley's, \"The Path of Thorns\", to an Australian setting, calling it \"Besieged in Port Arthur\".\nProduction.\nBland Holt had refused offers to film his play for a number of years until approached by Barrett and Percy Rea.\nShooting began in December 1919 in Narrabri and Moree, with interiors filmed at a temporary studio at the Theatre Royal in Sydney.\nAn additional sequence was shot consisting of a water ballet and a diving display by \"water nymphs\", shot in the National Park near Sydney. This sequence is missing from most versions of the film.\nReception.\nFemale lead Trilby Clark went to the US after filming and worked in theatre and movies.\nControversy.\nA New South Wales MP, Mr Wearne, asked questions in parliament complaining that the film's depiction of drought could create a bad impression overseas. An investigation was launched by the Chief Secretary's office, who later assured Wearne that new legislation meant that the export of the film could be banned by the Minister of Customs if he deemed it to be \"harmful to the Commonwealth\".\nLost Film.\nThe film was thought lost until 1976, when several rusty film cans containing it were found under a house in Hornsby.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

He was educated at the Royal Military College, Woolwich, and served in the Royal Artillery from June 1833.\nIn 1837 Warburton was sent with a detachment of the royal artillery to assist the Auxiliary Legion in Spain, and was seriously wounded in action. In the middle of July 1844 he embarked from Chatham for Canada. He returned from Canada in 1846, and was later stationed at Landguard Fort, near Harwich in Essex.\nIn November 1854 Warburton retired from the army as major on full pay, and resided at Henley House, Frant, Sussex. On 28 March 1857 he was elected by a large majority as an independent liberal member for . Apparently subject to pains, he shot himself through the head at Henley House on 23 October 1857, aged 41.

By the middle of July, the percent of the state by area that was in a D-2 (Severe Drought) according to the United States Drought Monitor was 23.01%, the greatest amount since the weekly reports began in 2000. Nearly 90% of the state was classified as \"Abnormally Dry\" or \"Moderate Drought\". For reference, none of the state has ever been placed in D-4 (Exceptional Drought) since the year 2000. Furthermore, \"The Buffalo News\" reported on July 22 that it had become the worst drought in the Buffalo area since their main weather station opened in 1943. There was a longer term dry period through the 1960s in New York with greater duration but less intensity.\nBy July the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) had placed the entire state in a \"drought watch\". While the drought is not nearly as severe as other droughts that take place in the west and midwestern United States in terms of duration and crop loss, droughts of this magnitude are rare in the humid temperate climate of Upstate New York. The drought began with a winter that in many areas in the northeast set a record warm December through February, leading to a weak spring meltoff.\nEarly summer.\nAlthough May saw decent rainfall, the preceding and following months saw great deficits. Streams and ponds dried or saw near record low flow rates, and the water table lowered significantly in some areas. Many large rivers, including the Genesee River, were running at about 20% of normal, many below the fifth percentile. Historical remains were briefly visible in the Genesee riverbed including a defunct fountain and a cofferdam where trains ran during early 20th century riverbed deepening to reduce flooding, as well as historic building foundations. Some crops began to fail by July, including crops that did not germinate in the dry soil, and production and nutrition was low in crops that did mature. Perennial crops including fruit trees, Christmas trees, and strawberries were also affected, with deeper root crops such as corn about half the normal height by early August. Significant shortfalls in pasture and hay production compounded very low milk prices to put an existential strain on local dairy farms. Due to extensive watering, the 2016 Garden Walk Buffalo was not significantly impacted. In mid July, the state issued a drought watch for the first time since 2002.\nSummer.\nBy late July, the area under the severe drought widened slightly to 26.82% despite widespread rains that exceeded an inch in parts of Western New York. The Taughannock Falls slowed to such a minimal flow that hiking the nearly empty riverbed of Taughannock Creek was permitted in Taughannock Falls State Park. On July 27, \"The Ithaca Journal\" reported that the Ithaca water supply reservoir was critically low, within a month of running dry, as areas creeks reached record lows. With many locations receiving less than half and as low as a third the normal amount of spring-summer rain, local wells ran dry. Anecdotally, rainfall was less than a quarter of normal with the drought being the worst in at least a half century. On August 3 the DEC, under direction of governor Andrew Cuomo, moved the entire Western portion of the state to drought warning, while the rest of the state remained under a drought watch.\nStatistically, it was the fifth driest spring-summer (March\u2013July) period in Buffalo () since record keeping began in 1871, with 1941 (), 1915 (), 1898 (), and 1934 () eclipsing it. However, this does not account for the mild winter or the above average temperatures and low humidity of the 2016 summer. Additionally, the rain was intermittent in larger amounts versus multi-day periods of slower, soaking rain.\nLate summer.\nOn August 8, a tropical system featuring high humidity and moisture was forecast to bring several inches of rain to Upstate New York over several days from Wednesday through the weekend, including enough moisture to produce up to two inches on the first day. The August 11 drought monitor report (valid up to Tuesday August 9) showed the area of severe drought increasing to 29.5%, covering nearly all of the state from Syracuse west and again setting a weekly report record, though it did not account for widespread rainfall of one half to two inches that took place on Wednesday August 10. Nonetheless, the drought continued as many locations were at a nearly 10 inch deficit for the year. The August 16 drought monitor report showed that while the severe drought area declined slightly, six percent of the state was upgraded to D3 (Extreme Drought), a first for the state during the summer (about 3% of state around New York City saw D3 drought in spring 2002) The area was a long narrow strip from Lake Erie to the northern half of Seneca County, roughly along the I-90 corridor, as well as a spot in the southern Finger Lakes. The Extreme Drought area remained the same for the next two weeks, other than the removal of the western fringe in Erie County. Keuka Lake neared it record low summer level of 713.25 ft (217.4 meters).\nThe September 6 report saw the D3 Extreme Drought area double to nearly 10% of the state, with the main area and spot to the southeast being connected. Also during this time (August 29), the United States Department of Agriculture designated 15 New York counties as drought disaster areas, qualifying some local farmers for low interest loans. The counties are Cayuga, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Tioga, Tompkins, Wyoming and Yates. Some surrounding counties were also eligible for the loans, available for eight months after August 29. In all about 18,000 farms covering 3.7 million acres are eligible for the funding when four related drought counties in Pennsylvania are included. New York State and agricultural representatives toured drought-stricken areas in early September. They included Senator Tom O'Mara, Senator Patty Ritchie New York State Department of Agriculture Commissioner Richard Ball.\nIn combination with also being one of the warmest summers in the area, including a sunny June and July and the hottest August on record for Rochester, the drought was worse than rainfall data would suggest, making it possibly the worst drought on modern record when the two factors were considered together.\nFall.\nThe drought continued through the middle of October, with about 5% of the state in the Finger Lakes still under D-3 Extreme Drought as of October 18. However, a several day pattern of rainy weather later that week dropped up to of rain in some areas, and several inches over much of the affected central New York area. The record rainfall effectively quelled the severe drought at least at surface level; however, the vast majority of the state remained \"abnormally dry\" or \"moderate drought\", with the Finger Lakes region and Western New York, as well as downstate, still in a substantial drought. The drought at this point was expected to last through January. After the first week of November, about 80% of the state was considered to be in a moderate drought, and about 23% in a D-2 Severe Drought, mainly in the southeastern Finger Lakes and downstate and central Long Island areas. By the mid November report, parts of the Hudson Valley were back into D-3 Extreme Drought category, as part of an ongoing drought in the tri-state (New York-New Jersey-Connecticut) New York metropolitan area that was also expected to last through winter.\nWinter.\nEarly winter in western New York saw several snowstorms as well as several inches of rain, though according to the drought monitor, much of the region where the drought was worst was still classified as abnormally dry or even moderate drought, though topsoil conditions were soggy. The Cheektowaga office of the National Weather Service reported an above average 6.17 inches of rain from December first to mid January, but snowfall was about ten inches short at 33 inches for the same period. The winter went on to be one of the warmest on record, with below average snowfall, but plenty of rainfall, effectively ending the drought in western New York. The drought was officially announced to be over in March 2017. The next spring went on to be one of the wettest on record in the northeast, causing Lake Ontario to hit record high levels. Buffalo, New York hit record high rainfall totals in April.\nConclusion.\nResults from a survey of over 200 farmers released in 2017 showed that over two thirds of un-irrigated fields had losses between 30 and 90 percent. Even irrigated crops had losses up to a third. Longer frost-free growing seasons and warmer temperatures create the need for increased rainfall to balance water loss. For legal and disaster loan purposes, the drought officially began on July 12, 2016 and included the counties of Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chenango, Cortland, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Madison, Monroe, Niagara, Onondaga, Orleans, Oswego, Steuben, Tioga, Tompkins and Wyoming. The drought was the most intense short duration drought since an 18-month drought in the early 30s.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

The drought began in late October 2018, and negatively affected food security in the region. In mid-August 2019, the drought was classified as a level 2 Red-Class event by the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System. The alert level was reduced to the Orange-1.7 by 12 December 2019, as the new wet season had started. In September 2020, the drought was classified as a level 2 Red-Class event. The drought continued into early 2021. Beginning in October 2021, South Africa experienced above average rainfall and reservoirs refilled by early 2022.\nDescription.\nBackground.\nAs a region, Southern Africa has historically been at high risk of droughts; a probability due to several meteorological and sociological factors.\nThe Southern African climate is affected by strong seasonal rainfall patterns; the majority of the region's annual rainfall is deposited by storms from early November to March, forming what is considered Southern Africa's wet season. The wet months of rainfall saturate the region's soil, providing moisture that persists for the drier months of the year. While this cycle is normally reliable, anomalies in the climate\u2014such as El Ni\u00f1o events\u2014disrupt the region's annual level of rainfall; this, in turn, causes the decline of the region's plant life, the lowering of water levels in bodies of water and a loss of moisture from the soil, with the latter effect causing a drought.\nAs noted by sources, Southern Africa's low level of economic development and reliance on agriculture\u2014namely cereal crops and livestock\u2014leave the region highly susceptible to droughts. Though variations exist, the region's farmers tend to plant their next crop in late October\u2014this sowing is timed with the expected rains that begin to arrive in November. The next five-six months are considered the \"lean\" season, during which time stockpiled food is consumed while the concurrent \"wet\" season rains nourish the next year's crops. However, if the usual rains are disrupted by a weather anomaly, planting is delayed until November or early December, resulting in a longer \"lean\" season before crops can be harvested. If the region's weather patterns are disrupted enough to cause drought, the lack of rainfall and eventual loss of moisture from soil often results in a noteworthy decline in Southern Africa's agricultural production; the resulting detrimental economic conditions lead to social unrest and a decline in the level of regional food security.\nPeriods of drought effect Southern Africa's various biomes and wildlife, while reduced water levels in rivers can cause hydroelectric dams to operate at reduced capacity. El Ni\u00f1o events in Southern Africa also increase the likelihood of African armyworm outbreaks, further decreasing the region's agricultural output.\nPrevious droughts.\nIn the late 2015 \u2013 early 2016 season, an El Ni\u00f1o event caused a drought in some parts of Southern Africa. As of the start of the 2018-19 ongoing El Ni\u00f1o-induced drought, some parts of Southern Africa had not yet recovered from the effects of the earlier drought.\nIn Namibia, the drought of 2012/2013 was thought to be the worst of the decade as around 42% if the total population experienced food insecurity. The Namibian government declared a state of emergency in 2012.\n2018\u20132021 drought.\nInitial warning.\nIn August and September 2018, several organizations began to warn farmers about the possibility of an oncoming drought. In August 2018 the Southern African Development Community advised farmers to avoid selling some of their stockpiled food from the previous season, and in September 2018 the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a warning to Southern African countries about the formation of conditions for a drought. Patrick Kormawa, the Sub-Regional Coordinator for FAO in Southern Africa, predicted a 40 percent chance the region would be impacted by an El Ni\u00f1o event in Fall 2018.\nCurrent drought.\nIn spring 2018, an El Ni\u00f1o event disrupted Southern Africa's annual rainfall. The first effect of this disruption was a delayed sowing date, which was pushed back from late October to early November. In November, a report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported an 80 percent likelihood of the El Ni\u00f1o event continuing until December; it also noted that 9.6 million people in Southern Africa were severely food-insecure as of the start of the 2019 lean season.\nThe drought continued to 2019 with multiple regions in Southern Africa seeing significantly reduced levels of rainfall. A report from FAO noted that, while rainfall had picked up in late December 2018, several areas within the region were suffering from a severe drought and accompanying effects.\nAs of April 2019, parts of Southern Africa remain affected by the ongoing drought. Heavier than average rainfall during the first weeks of February in some locales have alleviated local droughts, but the area as a whole is expected to suffer from negatively impacted cropping conditions. Rates of hunger in the region have risen, and are expected to continue to rise.\nThe drought was re-declared as national emergency in South Africa 4 March 2020. 17 March 2020 the black market of stolen water was reported in Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality amidst emergency-related corruption concerns.\nIn May 2019, Namibia declared a state of emergency in response to the drought, and extended it by additional 6 months in October 2019. This is the third time in six years the government has declared a state of emergency. The drought of 2019 has been described as the worst in the last 90 years in the country, with the lowest recorded rainfall in Windhoek since 1891.\nThe agricultural sector is one of Namibia's primary industries and due to extremely low rainfall in 2019, production in the sector fell by 17.5%. Grazing land conditions were observed to have deteriorated to a very poor state in many parts of the country leading to severe pressure on the grazing and to a severe decline in livestock due to starvation. A combination of lack of rainfall and low soil moisture led to a severe and prolonged drought in 2019 which resulted in real hardship and significantly affected many livelihoods, especially among the most vulnerable communities.\nIn August 2020 a vulnerability assessment conducted by the Namibian government found 427,905 Namibian people are currently food insecure. Factors that contribute to this insecurity includes the impact of droughts, floods, pests and worms.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}

{"id": "7870060", "revid": "75349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7870060", "title": "Drought in Australia", "text": "Drought in Australia is defined by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology as rainfall over period greater than three-months being in the lowest decile of what has been recorded for that region in the past. This definition takes into account that drought is a relative term and rainfall deficiencies need to be compared to typical rainfall patterns including seasonal variations. Specifically, drought in Australia is defined in relation to a rainfall deficiency of pastoral leases and is determined by decile analysis applied to a certain area. Note that this definition uses rainfall only because long-term records are widely available across most of Australia. However, it does not take into account other variables that might be important for establishing surface water balance, such as evaporation and condensation.\nHistorical climatic records are now sufficiently reliable to profile climate variability taking into account expectations for regions. Bureau of Meteorology records since the 1860s show that a 'severe' drought has occurred in Australia, on average, once every 18 years. State Governments are responsible for declaring a region drought affected and the declaration will take into account factors other than rainfall.\nAustralia has experienced a marked decrease in precipitation levels since 1994. Deficiencies in northern Australia increased in 2013\u201314, leading to an extended drought period in certain parts of Queensland. Between 2017 and 2019, severe drought developed once more across much of eastern and inland Australia including Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, also extending into parts of South and Western Australia.\nDroughts in the 19th century.\nSince 1860, when adequate meteorological recording commenced, the most severe droughts have occurred commonly at intervals of 11 to 14 years. Major droughts that were recorded later in the 19th century include:\nDrought in the 20th century.\nFederation drought.\nAt the time of Federation, Australia suffered a major drought. There had been a number of years of below average rainfall across most of Australia before the drought. During the drought, the wheat crop was \"all but lost\", and the Darling River was dry at Bourke, New South Wales, for over a year, from April 1902 to May 1903. There was concern about Sydney's water supply. By 1902, Australia's sheep population dropped from its 1891 level of 106 million to fewer than 54 million. Cattle numbers fell by more than 40 per cent. Sheep numbers did not return to 100 million until 1925.\nIn the 1911\u20131915 period, Australia suffered a major drought, which resulted in the failure of the 1914 wheat crop. During 1918 to 1920, a severe drought was experienced by Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, Northern Territory (Darwin-Daly Waters area and central Australia), Western Australia (Fortescue area), Victoria, and Tasmania.\nOther 20th century droughts.\nThe World War II drought: 1937 to 1945.\nDuring World War II frequent dry spells from 1937 to 1945 extended over New South Wales, Victoria, much of Queensland and parts of Western Australia, with more breaks than the Federation and Millennium droughts, but more periods of intense dryness. Parts of New South Wales, notably the central west, had record-low rainfall and in 1938 severe dry conditions intensified there and in Victoria, eastern South Australia and in southwest Australian grain-growing areas. An extremely dry six-month spell in Victorian forests contributed to the disastrous Black Friday bushfires of January 1939, before heavy rain came in late February 1939 over Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. \nThe rains were only a brief respite, and 1940 was one of the driest years of the century over most of southern Australia, emptying the Nepean Dam in New South Wales and imposing water restrictions in Brisbane. Perth had its driest year of the 20th century. Heavy rain in the southeastern States in November 1940 and\u00a0January 1941 slightly eased the situation and 1942 was a year of good general rain, but an even worse 1944 resulted when dearth of winter\u2013spring rains led to failure of the wheat crop and required populations in northern Victoria to cart water. Into 1945, large rivers virtually dried up, with most of the Hunter River ceasing flow and the Hawkesbury drying up at North Richmond. There was no flow in the Murray above Echuca. Adelaide faced water shortages while main Victorian water storages were empty in April 1945 and water restrictions were imposed as far north as Townsville. Dust storms blanketed South Australia, northern Victoria and southern New South Wales through the summer of 1944\u201345. \nArtist Russell Drysdale undertook 3-week 5000km tour, at the height of WW2, of wind-eroded drought-stricken areas on commission from \"The Sydney Morning Herald\". The articles written by Keith Newman and variously headed \"The country in which there are no Bushfires. There is nothing to burn;\" \"Worst Drought in Australia's History;\" and \"An Artist's Journey Into Australia's Lost World,\" were generously illustrated with stark line drawings by Drysdale and appeared on subsequent days 16-19 December 1944.\nThe drought broke in the southern States in winter 1945, with a good wheat harvest that year, but in some regions of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales 1946 was the worst year of all, and only in 1947 did significant general rains end the long drought.\nPost World War II.\nIn 1952 large regions across the North were affected by a failed wet season declared to be the \"driest season for 50 years.\" Its effect on agriculture was profound, with millions of cattle dying, many because the stock routes south were too dry to sustain their journey. Artist Sidney Nolan, on commission from the Brisbane \"Courier-Mail,\" produced a series of photographs of their dried carcasses, but the results were judged by editors to be too confronting and the article carried his drawings from the pictures instead.\nThe 1965 to 1968 drought.\nFrom 1965\u20131968, eastern Australia was again greatly affected by drought. Conditions had been dry over the centre of the continent since 1957 but spread elsewhere during the summer of 1964/1965. This drought contributed to the 1967 Tasmanian fires in which 62 people died in one day and 1,400 homes were lost.\n1980s.\nThe drought in 1982\u201383 is regarded as the worst of the twentieth century for short-term rainfall deficiencies of up to one year and their over-all impact. There were severe dust storms in north-western Victoria and severe bushfires in south-east Australia in February 1983 with 75\u00a0people killed. This El Ni\u00f1o-related drought ended in March, when a monsoon depression became an extratropical low and swept across Australia's interior and on to the south-east in mid- to late March.\n1990s Queensland drought.\nAn extremely severe drought occurred in the later year of 1991, which intensified in 1994 and 1995 to become the worst on record in Queensland. This drought was influenced by a strong El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern and associated with high temperatures in July and August 1995, the fifth continuous year of drought in parts of Queensland. According to Primary Industries Minister, Ed Casey, \"the drought affected region stretched in a 200\u00a0km to 300\u00a0km wide strip from Stanthorpe to Charters Towers\". So few wheat and barley crops survived, about half the usual for that year, that grains had to be imported from other states.\nIn June 1994, more than ten towns had lost irrigation systems; and some areas had gone five years without decent rainfall.\nA part of the upper Darling River system collapsed during this drought. By October 1994, the Condamine River was exhausted, reverting to a series of ponds. Across the state, in more than 13,000 properties, totaling 40% of Queensland, was drought declared. The flow past Goondiwindi was the lowest since 1940. Cotton farms near Moree and Narrabri had been allocated no water for irrigation, which resulted in a major loss of production. The town of Warwick was particularly affected.\nDrought in the 21st century.\n2000s or 'Millennium' drought in south-eastern Australia.\nFrom 1996 to 2010, south-eastern Australia experienced prolonged dry conditions with rainfall persistently well below average, particularly during the cooler months from April to October. The most acute period of the so-called 'Millennium drought' was between 2001 and 2009. The drought finished with the arrival of wet La Ni\u00f1a conditions during 2010 and 2011, with particularly heavy summer rainfall. \n1996 to 2000: patchy rainfall in the south-east.\nDry conditions began to emerge in south-eastern Australia during late 1996 and intensified during the strong 1997 El Ni\u00f1o event. Rainfall in 1998, 1999 and 2000 was closer to average, with isolated areas affected by rainfall well below average.\n2001 to 2009: the peak of the drought.\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorology, much of eastern Australia experienced a dry 2001. 2002 was one of Australia's driest and warmest years on record, with 'remarkably widespread' dry conditions, particularly in the eastern half of the country, which was again affected by El Ni\u00f1o conditions. It was, at the time, Australia's fourth driest year since 1900.\nThe El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern broke down during 2003, but occasional strong rainfall in 2003 and 2004 failed to alleviate the cumulative effect of persistently low rainfall in south-eastern Australia, with some measurement stations having recorded below average rainfall for eight consecutive years. Rainfall in early 2005 remained below average, and better rainfall in the second half of the year again failed to break continuing drought conditions in the south-east. South-east Australia experienced its second driest year on record in 2006, particularly affecting the major agricultural region of the Murray\u2013Darling basin. 2007 saw record temperatures across the south of Australia, and only patchy rain; promising early year rains contrasted with a very dry July\u2013October period, meaning that drought conditions persisted across much of the south-east. At this point, the Bureau of Meteorology estimated that south-eastern Australia had missed the equivalent of a full year's rain in the previous 11 years.\n2008 and 2009 saw continuing hot and dry conditions in south-eastern Australia, with occasional heavy rainfall failing to break the continuing drought. The effects of the drought were exacerbated by Australia's (then) second hottest year on record in 2009, with record-breaking heatwaves in January, February and the second half of the year.\n2010 and 2011: La Ni\u00f1a finally breaks the drought.\nAustralia's weather pattern transitioned rapidly to a wet La Ni\u00f1a pattern during autumn, resulting in record-breaking rains in the Murray-Darling Basin and well above average rainfall across the south-east. For many locations this was the first year of above-average rainfall since 1996. The rainfall dramatically increased surface water storage and soil moisture, effectively ending the drought in the south-east. Very wet conditions continued through 2011, resulting in floods in Queensland and northern Victoria.\nEffects on agricultural production.\nDairy producers were hit particularly hard by the drought. 2004 was a particularly bleak year in the sector, with revenue in the industry falling by 5.6%.\nAgricultural production was affected. Water use by the industry fell by 37% between 2000/01 and 2004/05, due mainly to drought. Around 20 cotton communities and 10,000\u00a0people directly employed by the cotton industry were impacted by the drought. The main areas affected were in New South Wales: Menindee, where the area under production was reduced by 100%, Bourke, area reduced by 99%, Walgett by 95%, the Macquarie River by 74% and Gwydir River by 60%. In Queensland, the worst-affected areas were Biloela, which reduced the area under production by 100%, Dirranbandi, by 91%, Central Highlandsby 82% and Darling Downs by 78%. Bourke has only had adequate water for one cotton crop in the last five years.\nDry conditions again began to develop and be sustained in mid-2013 through much of western Queensland. Although these began easing for western Queensland in early 2014, drought began to develop further east, along the coastal fringe and into the ranges of southeast Queensland and northeast New South Wales.\nDry conditions continued into 2015 in the east, particularly in Queensland where the monsoon rains were delayed. Queensland had experienced poor wet season rains for three consecutive seasons. Wetter conditions in 2016 eased the effects of drought in eastern Australia, but pockets of south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales remained drier than average.\nStock feed becomes scarce and farmers find it difficult to feed cattle and sheep.\nEarly 2017 to late 2019.\nMeteorological conditions.\n2017 was a drier than average year for much of inland Queensland, most of New South Wales, eastern and central Victoria, and all of Tasmania. In 2018, rainfall for the year was very low over the southeastern quarter of the Australian mainland, with much of the region experiencing totals in the lowest 10% of historical observations, and was particularly low over the mainland southeast from April onwards. The state of New South Wales was declared to be 100% in drought by August 2018, remaining at 98.6% \ninto May 2019; by May 2019 65.2% of Queensland was also declared to be in drought. Two southern parts of Western Australia were declared \"water deficient\" by May 2019 after months of drought, with other drought affected areas including central and east Gippsland in Victoria, and parts of eastern South Australia. On one-to-two-year timeframes to the end of March 2019, rainfall deficiencies in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, Australia's most extensive river system, were the third lowest on record, behind similar length timeframes between 1901 and 1903, and between 1918 and 1920. In July 2019, climatologist David Jones from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology stated that the present drought was now officially the worst on record in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin, and \"had now exceeded the Federation Drought, the WWII drought and the Millennium drought in terms of its severity through the MDB\". In October 2019, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology stated that drier and warmer and drier than average conditions were expected to persist at least until the end of the year with no relief in sight for most of the drought affected areas, influenced at least in part by a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and a prolonged period of negative SAM (Southern Annular Mode) during October and November. Exacerbating the effects of diminished rainfall in this drought has been a record breaking run of above average monthly temperatures, lasting 36 months to October 2019.\n the drought was continuing \u2013 including the driest November across Australia on record \u2013 but the Bureau of Meteorology reported that the positive Indian Ocean Dipole had weakened to around 50% of its peak seen in mid October, possibly indicating a future improvement in conditions later in the Australian summer.\nFrom 7-10 February 2020, many areas on the east coast of New South Wales received heavy and continuous rain, the heaviest falls for thirty years. of rain fell over the four days in Sydney, more than three times the February average. Flooding was extensive, including areas such as Lake Conjola, that had been devastated by bushfires about 6 weeks earlier. About 28500 people were affected by this drought.\nIn March 2021, above average rainfall led to serious and destructive flooding in the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment and on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales.\nAustralian Government response.\nIn November 2013 the Australian Government released a $500 million drought stimulus package, including an additional $2 million in loans under the Regional Investment Corporation under a reconfigured payment schedule, an extension to the existing Drought Communities Program which provides money to regional Councils, and supplementary payments under the Roads to Recovery program to assist with job creation in drought-affected areas. The plan also provided $100 million for South Australia to turn on its Adelaide Desalination Plant to significantly ramp up production of water to supply the Adelaide metropolitan area, to allow farmers affected by drought to access more water from the Murray River upstream. This followed the release of a $170 million Drought Stimulus Package by the New South Wales State Government in June.\n2019 bushfires.\nDry conditions in September 2019 contributed to several small to mid-range fires in north eastern New South Wales. By November of that year, continuing heat and lack of rain had desiccated the forests and agricultural land along the Great Dividing range in New South Wales and Queensland. Sydney received less than of rain in December 2019, with temperatures reaching 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Numerous intense bushfires occurred, some of which burnt Gondwanan rainforest remnants that had not experienced fires for millennia. This included Mount Nothofagus National Park and Nightcap National Park.\nFuture projections.\nAustralia's national science research agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), states that on account of projected future climate change, hot days will become more frequent and hotter (very high confidence), extreme rainfall events will become more intense (high confidence), and the time in drought is projected to increase over southern Australia (high confidence). Seasonal-average rainfall changes will vary across Australia: in southern mainland Australia, winter and spring rainfall is projected to decrease (high confidence), but increases are projected for Tasmania in winter (medium confidence), while in eastern and northern Australia in the near future (to 2030), natural variability is anticipated to predominate over trends due to greenhouse gas emissions. However even if climate change does not result in decreased rainfall in eastern and northern Australia over the period to 2030, the perceived severity of drought (in terms of low soil moisture) would increase on account of the higher evaporative demand resulting from the projected overall rise in average temperatures.", "matches": ["drought"], "label": []}
