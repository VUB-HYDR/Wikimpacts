Cloudbursts can quickly dump large amounts of water, e.g. 25\u00a0mm of the precipitation corresponds to 25,000 metric tons per square kilometre (1 inch corresponds to 72,300\u00a0short tons over one square mile). However, cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via the orographic lift or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air, resulting in sudden condensation. At times, a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst. The term \"cloudburst\" arose from the notion that clouds were akin to water balloons and could burst, resulting in rapid precipitation. Though this idea has since been disproven, the term remains in use.\nProperties.\nRainfall rate equal to or greater than per hour is a cloudburst. However, different definitions are used, e.g. the Swedish weather service SMHI defines the corresponding Swedish term \"skyfall\" as per minute for short bursts and per hour for longer rainfalls. The associated convective cloud can extend up to a height of above the ground.\nDuring a cloudburst, more than of rain may fall in a few minutes. The results of cloudbursts can be disastrous. Cloudbursts are also responsible for flash flood creation.\nRapid precipitation from cumulonimbus clouds is possible due to the Langmuir precipitation process in which large droplets can grow rapidly by coagulating with smaller droplets which fall down slowly. It is not essential that cloudbursts occur only when a cloud clashes with a solid body like a mountain, they can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensation.\nDetection and forecasting.\nWhile satellites are extensively useful in detecting large-scale weather systems and rainfall, the resolution of the precipitation radars of these satellites are usually smaller than the area of cloudbursts, and hence they go undetected.&lt;/ref&gt; Weather forecast models also face a similar challenge in simulating the clouds at a high resolution. The skillful forecasting of rainfall in hilly regions remains challenging due to the uncertainties in the interaction between the moisture convergence and the hilly terrain, the cloud microphysics, and the heating-cooling mechanisms at different atmospheric levels.\nLocations.\nAsia.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, a cloudburst usually occurs when a monsoon cloud drifts northwards, from the Bay of Bengal or Arabian Sea across the plains, then onto the Himalayas and bursts, bringing rainfall as high as 75 millimetres per hour.\nNorth America.\nColorado Piedmont.\nThe uplands adjacent to the Front Range of Colorado and the streams which drain the Front Range are subject to occasional cloudbursts and flash floods. This weather pattern is associated with upslope winds bringing moisture northwestward from the Gulf of Mexico.", "matches": ["cloudburst"], "label": []}

The mountain rises alongside Highway 99, also known as the Sea to Sky Highway, approximately midway between Squamish and Whistler. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains west into the Squamish River, and east into the Cheakamus River. Cloudburst Mountain is more notable for its steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises above the Squamish Valley in . The mountain's toponym was officially adopted December 12, 1939, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.\nClimate.\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Cloudburst Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures in winter can drop below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C", "matches": ["cloudburst"], "label": []}

The film is an adaptation of Fitzgerald's 2010 play of the same name.\n\"Cloudburst\" premiered at the Atlantic Film Festival in Halifax, Nova Scotia on September 16, 2011. It opened in a limited release in Canada on December 7, 2012.\nPlot.\nStella and Dotty are an older lesbian couple from Maine who embark on a Thelma and Louise-style road trip to Nova Scotia to get married after Dotty is moved into a nursing home by her granddaughter. Along the way they pick up Prentice, a hitchhiker travelling home to Nova Scotia to visit his dying mother, and the three bond as they travel together.\nProduction.\nFitzgerald adapted his own stage play for the screen. The film version was produced by Doug Pettigrew and Fitzgerald, and executive produced by Sidney Kimmel, Vicki McCarty, William Jarblum, Trudy Pettigrew, Dana Warren and Shandi Mitchell. Fitzgerald had originally planned for the role of Dotty to be played by Joan Orenstein, but as she died while he was writing it, he cast Fricker instead. In press for the film, Fricker praised the screenplay, \"I was so moved by it. The love story was so beautiful I couldn't say no to it.\" Three members of the original stage cast reprised their roles: Ryan Doucette, Marlane O'Brien, and Michael McPhee.\nCritical reception.\nThe film received an approval rating of 100% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.7/10, based on 9 reviews. The film debuted to an enthusiastic standing ovation on September 16, 2011 at the Atlantic Film Festival, where it won an Atlantic Canada Award for Best Screenplay and the People's Choice Audience Award for Best Film of the Festival. Its second festival appearance was October 20, 2011 at Cin\u00e9fest Sudbury International Film Festival, where it also won the Audience Choice Award for Best Film, and on October 23, 2011 the film was the opening night selection of the Edmonton International Film Festival where it won the Audience Award for Best Canadian Film. \"Cloudburst\" was very well received at film festivals from coast to coast in Canada, winning awards at festivals in Halifax, Montreal, Kingston, Edmonton, Victoria, and others.\n\"Cloudburst\" made its U.S. debut at the Palm Springs International Film Festival where it was named a Best of the Fest.

The play starred Carroll Godsman, Deborah Allen, Ryan Doucette, Marlane O'Brien, Michael McPhee and Amy Reitsma. The successful engagement ran for five weeks and closed on May 8, 2010.

Whitacre began writing the piece in 1991 (when the composer was 21), at the request of conductor Dr. Jocelyn K. Jensen for her high school choir - the final version of the piece was published in 1995. The text was adapted from Octavio Paz's poem \"El c\u00e1ntaro roto\" (The Broken Water-Jar), and inspired by the experience of the composer witnessing a desert cloudburst.\nThe first section is a cappella, notable for its dissonant tone clusters. Whitacre notates long, sustained notes with text to be spoken at random by each individual singer. Following the opening section is a baritone solo, which is then followed by the development of a new a cappella theme. This section continues into a spoken, arrhythmic incantatory solo with background.\nIn the section titled \"The Cloudburst\", handbells (which are directed to be hidden from the audience) play a written two bars, and then play at random as the choir crescendos into an aleatoric section, which is signaled by a loud clap of \"thunder\". During this time, the choir begins claps, snaps, and thigh smacks in order to imitate the sound of rain. A thunder sheet, bass drum, handbells, suspended cymbal, wind chimes, and piano contribute to the effect of a thunderstorm. The storm gradually builds then fades, and the ending of the piece mirrors the beginning section, with the choir arpeggiating as the piano voices block chords.\n\"Cloudburst\" was the title feature of an album by Stephen Layton's chamber choir Polyphony. The album included other works by Whitacre and was nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award in best Choral Performance.\nA concert band version, commissioned for the Indiana All-State Band, was released by Whitacre in 2001.", "matches": ["cloudburst"], "label": []}
