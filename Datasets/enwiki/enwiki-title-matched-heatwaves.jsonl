In the Central England Temperature series, dating back to 1659, at the time it was the 2nd hottest July on record, the hottest since 1783. As of 2022, it is the 9th hottest July on record. The month included some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the UK. Temperature records from this time are likely dubious as the Stevenson screen was not introduced until the 1860s.\nWeather.\nJuly 1808 was the second hottest July on record, at the time with an extreme notable heatwave from the 12th to 15 July, peaking on the 13th and 14th. Temperatures above were recorded in many areas on the 13th and 14th, with London reaching on the 13th, with a possible reading of .\nWhen the heatwave was coming to a close on the 15th, there were some very severe thunderstorms. These most severe of the storms affected Dorset, Somerset &amp; Gloucestershire. However, a swath was also damaged between Bath and Bristol. Reports of hail stones up to long were recorded in Somerset, with hailstones of a more general being reported as well. Ball Lightning was also observed in Gloucester, and was noted as destroying one of the pinnacles at the west end of Gloucester Cathedral. It is thought that this is one of the most severe hailstorms in the history of the United Kingdom, along with that of 1697.\nImpacts.\nAs a result of the hot temperatures and following thunderstorms, many people lost their lives, especially in the counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Northampton. Animals were also badly affected as a result of the hot weather, with 50 post horses dying as a result on the Great North Road alone. Farmers also struggled. Despite being able to harvest their crops early, other products melted quickly such as butter and honeycomb.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

At the same time, there was a severe drought on the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. It was one of the driest, sunniest and warmest summers (June/July/August) in the 20th century, although the summer of 1995 is now regarded as the driest. Only a few places registered more than half their average summer rainfall. In the Central England temperature record, it was the warmest summer in the series until being surpassed in the 21st century. It was the warmest summer in the Aberdeen area since at least 1864, and the driest summer since 1868 in Glasgow. \nThe health effects of the heat contributed to mortality displacement during the year. Wildlife and vegetation effects were also observed. The British government implemented water rationing to mitigate the impact of the drought. It remains a reference point for unusually hot summers in the country.\nHeatwave and drought effects.\nHeathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) from 23 June to 8 July and for 15 consecutive days from 23 June to 7 July temperatures reached 32.2\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) somewhere in England. Furthermore, five days saw temperatures exceed 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F). On 28 June, temperatures reached 35.6\u00a0\u00b0C (96.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in Southampton, the highest June temperature recorded in the UK. The hottest day of all was 3 July, with temperatures reaching 35.9\u00a0\u00b0C (96.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in Cheltenham.\nThe great drought was due to a very long dry period. The summer and autumn of 1975 were very dry, and the winter of 1975\u201376 was exceptionally dry, as was the spring of 1976; indeed, some months during this period had no rain at all in some areas.\nThe drought was at its most severe in August 1976 and in response Parliament passed the Drought Act 1976 to ration water. Parts of the south west went 45\u00a0days without any rain in July and August. As the hot and dry weather continued, devastating heath and forest fires broke out in parts of Southern England. 50,000 trees were destroyed at Hurn Forest in Dorset. Crops were badly hit, with \u00a3500\u00a0million worth of crops failing. Food prices subsequently increased by 12%.\nIn the last week of August 1976, days after Denis Howell was appointed 'Minister for Drought', severe thunderstorms brought rain to some places for the first time in weeks. September and October 1976 were both very wet months, bringing to an end the great drought of 1975\u20131976.\nThe Haweswater reservoir had only 10% of its water left; people walked dryshod on its bed below its normal water level. The site of the flooded village of Mardale Green was dry. Ladybower reservoir in Derbyshire dried out and revealed the flooded villages of Ashopton and Derwent, it was possible to make out the village layout and garden walls.\nIn Ireland the temperature reached in County Offaly on 29 June 1976. There were also gorse fires in County Wicklow.\nHealth impact.\nThe 1976 heatwave is understood to have been the cause of 20% \"excess deaths\" and there was a significant increase in hospital emergency admissions from 24 June to 8 July 1976 compared with the same period in 1975 or 1974. This compares to 59% excess deaths for the 2003 heatwave.\nEcological impact.\nMassive swarms of seven-spotted ladybirds (\"Coccinella septempunctata\") occurred across the country, with the British Entomological and Natural History Society estimating that by late July 23.65 billion of them were swarming across the southern and eastern coasts of England. The population explosion occurred because a warm spring had meant there were many aphids, the ladybirds' food prey; as the hot weather dried the plants on which the aphids fed, the aphid populations collapsed, causing the ladybirds to swarm to try to find food elsewhere.\nThe extensive fires paradoxically helped preserve many areas of heathland that had been becoming scrubland through natural succession because of reduced grazing pressure; the only long-term effect of the fires on Dorset heathlands was a change in the composition of scrub. The impacts of the extended drought on mature trees, especially beech, were still evident in UK woodlands in 2013.\nGovernment response.\nThe effect on domestic water supplies led to the passing of a Drought Act by Parliament and Minister for Drought, Denis Howell, was appointed. There was some water rationing and public standpipes in some affected areas. Reservoirs were at an extremely low level, as were some rivers. The rivers Don, Sheaf, Shire Brook and Meers Brook (all in Sheffield) all ran completely dry, without a drop of water in any of them, as well as Frecheville Pond and Carterhall Pond.\nLonger term, the UK Department of the Environment realised it needed more information about the storage capacity and other properties of British aquifers, as sources of groundwater.\nComparisons.\nThe highest temperature during the 1976 heatwave was , 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C below the record at the time of set on 9 August 1911. As of 2022, 1976 has the 13th hottest day in UK history. In the Central England Temperature series, 1976 is the hottest summer for more than 350 years. The average temperature over the whole summer (June, July, August) was , compared to the average for the unusually warm years between 2001\u20132008 of . As of 2022, the hottest years in the series are 2003, 2006 and 2014. \nThe summer became embedded in the national psyche, with subsequent heatwaves in 1995, 1997, 2003, 2006 and 2022, all using 1976 as a benchmark. The 1976 heatwave was a rarity within its decade. Heatwaves in the UK and worldwide have since become more frequent and intense due to climate change.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

They caused continent-wide wildfires, with thousands dying due to heat-related causes. Other heat waves have been felt throughout the year, including in the Americas, China, Australia and the Indian subcontinent.\nImpacts and measures.\nAs record-breaking heatwaves and droughts affected water supplies, rivers (along with shipping and nuclear reactor cooling), ecosystems, various global supply chains, health, and agriculture worldwide, in Europe, Spain domestically restricted e.g. air conditioning to defined temperature ranges, in the U.S., entities were required to provide plans to reduce their water usage, and China experienced large blackouts and experimented with cloud seeding among other measures, despite experts stating it would be \"marginally effective\" and possibly exacerbate problems.

Records were set around the country for temperature in England, including the highest accepted temperature, at the time, of , only broken 79 years later in the 1990 heatwave, which reached . A temperature of was recorded at Greenwich in a Glaisher stand and was regarded as the record but further data from a Stevenson screen in the same location showed the temperature to be . The highest ever accepted temperature is currently recorded on the 19 July 2022 in Coningsby, Lincolnshire. Weather in Northern Europe was also affected around about this time.\nDescription.\nThe heatwave began around early July and ended two and a half months later, in mid September.\nBy 17 July temperatures were and by 20 July there had been no rain for 20 days, meaning a drought had officially begun. In the height of the heatwave, at the end of July, temperatures were in Kings Lynn, breaking all previous records in that area. The heatwave and drought continued into August, with temperatures up to on 1 August continuing throughout the month in London. Even into September, the heatwave was still continuing, with temperatures up to in early September.\nThe heatwave and drought only ended on 11 September when average temperatures dropped by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11\u00b0C) and the high pressure dominating the country receded, allowing rain over all parts of the country.\nHeatwave impacts.\nThe impacts of the heatwave extended over all parts and sectors of the country. The impacts began to be felt around mid July, around three weeks after the heatwave began. Because of the extreme heat, working patterns changed in Lancashire, with work beginning at dawn, around 4:30\u00a0am and finishing around midday, to avoid the hottest part of the day in the quarrying industry there. Fatalities became common and newspapers such as The Times ran \"Deaths by heat\" columns as temperatures continued to rise. The heat also caused indirect deaths, by melting the asphalt on roads, causing numerous accidents.\nBy the beginning of August, even the health of country people was being adversely affected with stifling, humid nights, meaning food spoiled very quickly without refrigeration and sewage spilled out. Also in August, striking became common, most notably in the Victoria and Albert Docks, where the entire workforce of 5,000 people walked out, because of the intolerable heat, meaning the whole area came to a standstill.\nDrought impacts.\nThe extensive drought affected all parts of the country. Again, the effects were felt around mid July, when early harvests were taken in and fires began to break out, along railway tracks in Ascot and gorse around Newbury. By the end of July, the heat and lack of rain had begun to affect agriculture. There was a shortage of grass for cattle as pastures turned brown from drought. This forced farmers to raise the price of milk, to compensate for the lack of production. On 28 July trees and some rare plants had begun to wither and die with the lack of water in the soil, even in shaded areas all around the country. By August, wells, water pumps and water supplies had begun to run completely dry. This led to the stopping of activity in farming and pasture in Essex and the closing of wool mills in Bradford, each an important industry in its area.\nAn unusual impact of the hot and dry 1911 summer was seen in the County Championship of 1911, where Warwickshire's narrow win was the only time between 1890 and 1935 where the Championship was \"not\" won by one of the \"Big Six\" of Yorkshire, Surrey, Kent, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex. The unusually hot and dry weather created extremely fast pitches that suited Warwickshire's pace bowlers Foster and Field and camouflaged their deficiencies in batting and spin bowling on wet pitches.\nSunshine.\nSunshine in July 1911 broke all time records for the UK and across the south coast of England, with Eastbourne, Sussex topping 383.9 hours, averaging 12.4 hours a day, with many other south coast spots such as Bognor Regis with 372.2 hours not far behind. Much of the south coast outshone many Mediterranean locations, and Eastbourne was very close to the levels of sunshine expected in Las Vegas and in the Nevada desert in the US for July. Since the average July sunshine in Eastbourne is about 255 hours, the town received about 50% more sunshine than usual.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

Some of the Peak District was closed to the public to try to prevent further fires occurring from careless visitors. Roads were clogged as people flocked to the coast and to holiday resorts throughout the country. Transport was further hampered as train services around the country slowed due to concerns over anomalies in the railway network from the intense heat.

Power cuts took place in parts of Bangladesh due to a surge in electricity demand caused by the heat wave. Cases of heat exhaustion and heat stroke have increased in the country due to the heat.\nM. A. Rahim, a professor at Daffodil University in Dhaka, said that the heat wave was impacting the country's rice and fruit production, estimating that rice production could fall by up to 40%.\nIndia.\nIn India, six cities in the north and eastern regions recorded temperatures above 44\u00b0C (111.2\u00b0F), while New Delhi recorded 40.4\u00b0C (104.72\u00b0F) on 18 April.\nThe Ministry of Labour issued an advisory to all states and regions to provide workers with adequate drinking water, emergency ice packs and frequent breaks. Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, closed all schools in the state between 17 and 22 April due to concerns about the heat. In the same week, schools were closed in Tripura and Odisha.\nKarnataka's three coal power plants, which previously had reduced demand, have been set to run at full-throttle to meet the increased electricity demand caused by the heat wave. K. J. Ramesh, director general of meteorology at the Meteorological Department, said in May that some states had started implementing mitigation efforts, such as closing schools by 1p.m., operating government offices at 7a.m.\u20131p.m. and advising youths and seniors to stay indoors at 11a.m.\u20133p.m.\nMaharashtra deaths.\nOn 16 April, 13 people died from heat stroke after attending the Maharashtra Bhushan award event in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, and 50\u201360 people were hospitalised.\nThe incident happened at a government event where Union Home Minister Amit Shah presented social worker Appasaheb Dharmadhikari with the Maharashtra Bhushan award. The episode was brought on by extended physical effort and exposure to high temperatures. Despite the fact that the IMD had not issued any heat wave warnings on that particular day, doctors have linked the deaths to prolonged exposure to heat in open spaces and strenuous activity. Many people came from nearby districts as well, which would have made their situation worse. Outrage over the occurrence has led to political figures calling for the government to be held accountable for the fatalities.\nNana Patole, President of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee, has sought the resignations of the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister and called for the administration to be held accountable. Uddhav Thackeray, the former chief minister of Maharashtra, and Ajit Pawar, the head of the NCP, went to the hospital to inspect the situation and criticise the organisation of the event. Concerns regarding the need for improved planning and procedures to stop similar catastrophes in the future have been raised in response to the tragedy.\nPakistan.\nIn Pakistan, nine cities recorded temperatures greater than or equal to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) on 23 April.\nSri Lanka.\nOn 17 April, Sri Lanka's Department of Meteorology warned that the temperature was expected to increase to \"caution level\" in the Eastern, North Central and North Western provinces and the Hambantota, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Monaragala, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya districts.

He noted, \"Because dry soil heats up faster than moist soil, a hot anomaly naturally forms as spring arrives\".\nCambodia.\nCambodia has been affected by water shortages due to high water demand in Thailand. Cambodia's Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology predicted that hot weather would continue until mid-May, with less rainfall than in 2022. It also said that weather patterns were being affected by El Ni\u00f1o, and the resulting heat would last until August. In May, temperatures of 41.6\u00b0C (106.9\u00b0F) were recorded in Krati\u00e9 and the Ponhea Kraek district, setting a new national May record.\nLaos.\nIn Laos, the Sainyabuli province reached 42.9\u00b0C (108.86\u00b0F) on 19 April in a new all-time record for the country. On 6 May, Luang Prabang reached 43.5\u00b0C (110.3\u00b0F), surpassing the country's previous record, and Thakhek recorded 31.8\u00b0C (89.2\u00b0F) that night, making it the country's hottest night.

On the following day, the temperature in Ang Mo Kio hit 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), tying the record set on 17 April 1983 at Tengah.\nSeveral schools have begun relaxing their rules on school uniforms to help students deal with the heat. Singapore's Meteorological Service said earlier in May that the country was \"not currently experiencing a heatwave\" despite recently recording relatively high temperatures.\nThailand.\nIn Thailand, the temperature rose to over 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F) for the first time in its history according to Herrera, with the city of Tak reaching 45.4\u00b0C (113.72\u00b0F) on 15 April. Large portions of the country have had temperatures in the range of upper 30s to lower 40s degrees Celsius since March. According to ArabiaWeather, Thailand's previous all-time record was 44.6\u00b0C (112\u00b0F) in the Mae Hong Son province. Two deaths due to the heat wave were reported.\nThousands were forced to flee from Chiang Mai due to pollution caused by the annual burning in northern Thailand and Myanmar. Power outages have become common due to the high use of air conditioners and refrigeration. On 25 April, rain in Bangkok brought respite from the heat. \nThe Thai government has issued health warnings, with the health department warning about the risk of heat stroke. On 22 April, the government issued a warning for people to stay indoors. On 21 April, Thailand's national weather service said that the heat index hit a record of 54\u00b0C (129.2\u00b0F).\nOn 6 May, Bangkok reached 41\u00b0C (105.8\u00b0F), the highest recorded in the city. On the next day, there were reports of people fainting due to the extreme heat, including advance voters in the 2023 general election. This included 14 people at Ramkhamhaeng University and 3 at Chan Kasem Rajabhat University. In the same week, temperatures in the northern and central regions remained above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), resulting in an increase in power demand.\nVietnam.\nIn Vietnam, the H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh province recorded the highest temperature in 27 years for March in Kim B\u00f4i district at 41.4\u00b0C (106.52\u00b0F). On 6 May, the temperature in reached 44.1\u00b0C (111.38\u00b0F), surpassing the country's previous record of 43.4\u00b0C (110.12\u00b0F) in 2019. Later, the temperature reached 44.2\u00b0C (111.56\u00b0F) in the T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng district.\nEast Asia.\nChina.\nChina has also been affected by the heat wave, with temperatures rising as high as 42.4\u00b0C (108.32\u00b0F) in Yuanyang County, Yunnan on 18 April. According to climatologist Jim Yang, over 100 weather stations broke their temperature record on 17 April. In multiple provinces, temperatures have exceeded 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F).\nOn 22\u201323 April, a cold front sweeping south and east triggered a significant drop in temperatures, torrential rain and heavy snowfall in parts of northern China, with Shanxi reporting up to 24 cm of snow.\nOn 6 May, the Changjiang Li Autonomous County in Hainan province reached 41.5\u00b0C (106.7\u00b0F), making it the highest temperature recorded in the province.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, the temperature in Minamata, Kumamoto reached 30.2\u00b0C (86.36\u00b0F) in a new April record for the area.\nCentral Asia.\nUnusual temperatures for April were also recorded in several central Asian countries, including Kazakhstan, where the city of Taraz reached 33.6\u00b0C (92.48\u00b0F), as well as Turkmenistan, which reached 42.4\u00b0C (108.32\u00b0F), and Uzbekistan.\nImpact of climate change.\nParts of Thailand and Vietnam have been affected by thick smog during the heat wave; experts contacted by NBC News noted that the combination of extreme heat and air pollution could lead to an increase in respiratory, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, and these impacts would worsen due to climate change intensifying heat waves and air pollution.\nA May study by the World Weather Attribution found that the heat wave was made at least 30 times more likely by climate change in India and Bangladesh.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The film stars Gordon Pinsent as Cliff Reynolds, a television news cameraman in Montreal who becomes drawn into the city's criminal underworld after witnessing a heroin deal while filming a news report.\nThe cast also includes Lawrence Dane, Alexandra Stewart, Domini Blythe, Jon Granik, Al Waxman, and Walter Massey, as well as cameo appearances by real-life CFCF-TV journalists Andrew Marquis and Don McGowan as colleagues of Reynolds.\nBackground.\nThe film was made as part of the National Film Board of Canada's \"Filmglish\" series, an experiment in producing films that could function both as commercial entertainment when screened as a feature film, and as educational material when edited into a series of 20 to 30 minute short films to be screened in English as a Second Language classrooms and paired with a lesson on various words and phrases used in the dialogue. The NFB initiated the project after having some success repackaging its 1962 film \"Drylanders\" as a set of shorter films for classroom use, and decided in the early 1970s to experiment with making new films that were designed for that dual use from the outset.\nOther films in the series included Bernard Devlin's \"A Case of Eggs\", Rudi Dorn's \"A Moving Experience\", John Howe's \"A Star Is Lost!\" and Michael Scott's \"The Winner (Albert la grenouille)\", although \"Heatwave\" was the only one of the five newer films that was relatively well received by critics or audiences.\nJackson noted that one of the key limitations imposed by the educational aspect of the film's mandate was that even though the film was set in Montreal, he was unable to depict any characters speaking with a French Canadian accent.\nDistribution.\nThe film premiered on April 28, 1975, as an episode of the ABC late-night anthology \"Wide World of Entertainment\". It was promoted as the first Canadian feature film ever sold to network television in the United States. It received strong ratings in that broadcast, with ABC purchasing rights to rerun it later in the year.\nIt was later broadcast by CBC Television in Canada on August 10.\nReception.\nThe film was submitted to the 26th Canadian Film Awards. Martin Knelman of \"The Globe and Mail\" erroneously listed it as a finalist for Best Motion Picture on October 9, but the paper published a correction a few days later indicating that it was not up for Best Picture, and instead Knelman had omitted the film \"Lions for Breakfast\" from his earlier report.", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

It was first recorded by the British-based multinational funk-disco band Heatwave in 1976. Released as a single on December 3, 1977, the song is included on Heatwave's debut album \"Too Hot to Handle\" (1976) and has been covered by numerous artists, becoming something of a standard.\nThe song reached number 18 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in March 1978 after peaking at number two on the US \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart, the band's highest showing on that tally. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA on September 6, 2001. In the UK, the songs \"Too Hot to Handle\" and \"The Groove Line\" were released before a double A-sided \"Always and Forever\" / \"Mind Blowing Decisions\" was issued in November 1978. This became the band's second top-10 hit on the UK Singles Chart when it spent two weeks at number nine in December.\nHeatwave version.\nAfter the international success of Heatwave's disco single \"Boogie Nights\", \"Always and Forever\" was chosen as the U.S. follow-up single in late 1977. A ballad featuring lead vocals by Johnnie Wilder, Jr., \"Always and Forever\" stood out among the band's predominantly disco repertoire and became a successful U.S. hit song in early 1978.\nIn the late 1970s through to the 1980s, it was a popular \"slow dance\" song at high school proms, weddings, particularly in inner-city areas with a high minority population. The song was also played during the slow dance scene in the movie \"House Party\".\nIn the liner notes to Heatwave's 1996 compilation album, \"The Best of Heatwave: Always and Forever\", music writer and former \"Billboard\" contributor Brian Chin notes that Wilder\nsays that it was right around the time of the single release of \"Always and Forever\" that he knew Heatwave's music would stand the test of time. This pop standard is emblematic of the Heatwave fusion of influences - R&amp;B, teen romance, and both European and American flavors of pop.\nAllMusic reviewer Craig Lytle states that the song \"was and continues to be an ageless piece. Johnnie Wilder's vocal exhibition throughout the vamp is breathtaking.\"\nIn 2009, \"Essence\" magazine included the song in their list of the \"25 Best Slow Jams of All Time\".\nLuther Vandross version.\nAmerican R&amp;B/soul singer-songwriter Luther Vandross released his cover of \"Always and Forever\" as the second single from his ninth album, \"Songs\" (1994). His recording earned him a Grammy Award nomination in the category Best Male R&amp;B Vocal performance at the Grammy Awards of 1995 and placed on four US \"Billboard\" charts, with its best showing on the R&amp;B chart, where it reached number 16. Vandross's single made the Hot 100 at number 58 and also appeared on \"Billboard\"s adult contemporary and rhythmic top 40 charts.\nCritical reception.\nLarry Flick from \"Billboard\" described the song as \"a faithful rendition of a romantic standard\". He added, \"Layered with glorious strings and the golden input of producer Walter Afanasieff, single has the potential to go where his \"Endless Love\" duet with Mariah Carey did not\u2013right to the top of the Hot 100. His voice has rarely fit so well with a song intended for pop radio consumption.\" Steve Baltin from \"Cash Box\" stated, \"Despite the challenge of young guns on the r&amp;b charts and big-name stars on the pop charts, Luther\u2019s new album \"Songs\", made up of covers, has been a big crossover hit. [...] This remake of an r&amp;b classic should keep the fire burning, as Vandross gives the song the treatment, exploding at the climax. Big on A.C. and urban, with some top 40 appeal.\" In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton felt that \"it never was the most exciting of records and Luther does little to add to this.\"\nOther significant cover versions.\nAmong many artists who have recorded versions of \"Always and Forever\" is the American R&amp;B vocal group Whistle, who released their single in 1990 from their album of the same name. Their take on the song made the top 10 on the \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart, peaking at number nine, while also cracking the top 40 of the Hot 100 at #35.\nAmerican pop singer Johnny Mathis recorded the song for his 2008 compilation album, \"A Night to Remember\".", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

Carbon fiber reinforced carbon matrix (C/C) can be used up to 3000\u00a0\u00b0C because carbon is the element with the highest melting point however C/C are ablative materials which dissipate energy consuming themselves. Carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites (C/SiC) and Silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites (SiC/SiC) are considered reusable materials because silicon carbide is a hard material with a low erosion and it forms a silica glass layer during oxidation which prevents further oxidation of inner material. Unfortunately above a certain temperature (it depends on environmental conditions of oxygen partial pressure) starts the active oxidation of silicon carbide matrix to gaseous silicon monoxide (SiO(g)), consequently loss of protection from further oxidation, which leads the material to an uncontrolled and fast erosion. For this reason C/SiC and SiC/SiC are used in the range of temperature between 1200\u00b0 - 1400\u00a0\u00b0C.\nOn the one hand CMCs are lightweight materials with high strength-to-weight ratio even at high temperature, high thermal shock resistance and toughness but suffer of erosion during service. On the other side bulk ceramics made of ultra-high temperature ceramics (e.g. ZrB2, HfB2, or their composites) are hard materials which show low erosion even above 2000\u00a0\u00b0C but are heavy and suffer of catastrophic fracture and low thermal shock resistance compared to CMCs. Failure is easily under mechanical or thermo-mechanical loads because of cracks initiated by small defects or scratches. The possibility to obtain reusable components for aerospace field based on UHTC matrix into fiber reinforced composites is still under investigation.\nThe European Commission funded a research project, C3HARME, under the NMP-19-2015 call of Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development in 2016 (still ongoing) for the design, development, production and testing of a new class of ultra-refractory ceramic matrix composites reinforced with silicon carbide fibers and Carbon fibers suitable for applications in severe aerospace environments as possible near-zero ablation thermal protection system (TPS) materials (e.g. heat shield) and for propulsion (e.g. rocket nozzle).

In Iowa, many cities tied the records set the previous day. However, in the Great Plains temperatures continued to rise as a new heat wave began to develop.\nHeat Persists over the Great Plains.\nAlthough heat in the Midwest had begun to subside, heat had been building in the Great Plains over that period. It began on July 13 when there was a noticeable increase in temperatures but began to peak on July 14.\nOn July 14, the temperature climbed to 107F in Lincoln, NE after having 5 days of temperature's in the low 100's, though that night it would be the first time the temperature fell below 80F in a week. Norfolk, NE hit 105F and Omaha, NE hit 109F. Further south, Topeka, KS hit 108F, and Kansas City, MO hit 109F. In Tulsa, OK, temperatures had been climbing the past couple days and hit 110F this day. This heat would persist into the next day before temperatures would fall noticeably on the 16th over the Central Great Plains.\nOn July 17, temperatures once again began to rise. Nebraska set a record high of 118F in Hartington, NE. Sioux City, SD and Sioux Falls, IA also set record highs of 110F. In Grand Island, NE it was 114F, falling 2 degrees short of the record in 1934, while Hastings, NE would set a record of 115F. It was also 110F in Fort Smith, AR.\nOn July 18, the heat would peak. Kansas and Oklahoma set record highs of 121F in Fredonia and 120F in Alva, respectively. Wichita, KS hit 112F, Salina, KS hit 116F, 110F in Topeka, KS, and 113F in Tulsa, OK (a record high for July). On July 19, Oklahoma's record would be tied in Altus.\nLatter part of July.\nFor many areas, temperatures would be relatively lower for the last part of the month. Most areas saw highs fall below 100F on July 20 and 21 for the first time in nearly 2 weeks. However, temperatures would rise back into the 100's over the Great Plains after this, though generally wouldn't be as high as earlier in the month. The notable exception would be in Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas. \nOn July 24, Grand Island, NE broke their record high with a high 117F. Hastings, NE also set a new all-time high of 116F. Both Kansas and Nebraska tied their all-time record highs in Alton and Minden, respectively just days after they were set. \nOn July 25, the temperature rose to 115F in Lincoln, NE (a record high for the city) but would only fall to 91F that night. Outside of the Desert Southwest, this is one of the highest low temperatures ever recorded in the US. Omaha, NE also set a record high of 114F, though had a low of 83F. On the previous day Grand Island, NE broke their record with a high 117F. Des Moines, IA would set their record high of 110F this day as well. Iowa set their record high of 117F in Atlantic and Logan.\nAugust 1936 and afterwards.\nAugust was the warmest month on record for five states. Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana also set all-time high records. Many experienced long stretches of daily maximum temperatures or warmer. Drought conditions worsened in some locations. Other states were only slightly warmer than average.\nThe heat wave and drought largely ended in September, although many states were still drier and warmer than average. Many farmers' summer harvests were destroyed. Grounds and lawns remained parched. Seasonable temperatures returned in the autumn.\nSummer 1936 remained the warmest summer on record in the USA (since official records begin in 1895), until 2021. However February 1936 was the coldest February on record, and 5 of the 12 months were below average, leaving the full year 1936 at just above the average.\nEffects.\nAs many as 5,000 heat-related deaths were reported in the United States, and 780 direct and 400 indirect deaths in Canada.\nAlmost 5,000 people suffered from heat stroke and heat exhaustion, particularly the elderly. Unlike today, air conditioning was in the early stages of development and was therefore absent from houses and commercial buildings. Many of the deaths occurred in high-population-density areas of Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Toronto, and other urban areas. Farmers across the continent saw crop failure, causing corn and wheat prices to rise quickly. Droughts and heat waves were common in the 1930s. The 1930s (the Dust Bowl years) are remembered as the driest and warmest decade for the United States, and the summer of 1936 featured the most widespread and destructive heat wave to occur in the Americas in centuries.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

Many areas in Japan experienced temperatures in excess of , and Kumagaya recorded a maximum temperature of on 23\u00a0July \u2013 the highest ever observed in the country.\nSynopsis.\nFollowing flooding and mudslides that lasted from late June through mid-July 2018, an extensive heat wave spread across the Japanese mainland. In the prefectures that had been hit the worst by floods and landslides, Hiroshima, Okayama, and Ehime, 145 people were hospitalized with heat stroke symptoms as temperatures there rose above . On 15 July, 200 out of 927 stations in the nationwide observation network recorded maximum temperatures exceeding . On 23 July, a high temperature of was observed in Kumagaya, northwest of Tokyo. This constitutes an all-time high for all of Japan. Many cities recorded temperatures near on this day. In Kyoto, temperatures stood above for seven days in a row for the first time since records began to be kept in the 19th century. \nBy 24\u00a0July, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) called the event a natural disaster and indicated many areas were observing \"unprecedented levels of heat\". A study depicted the three\u2010phase lifecycle of the East Asian summer monsoon and the corresponding timing of the 2018 consecutive extreme events (indicated in the bottom). The sequential yet contrasting extreme events in Japan therefore reflect an amplified monsoon lifecycle projected in a warmer climate.(ASL study 2019)\nEffects.\nIn South Korea, some 42 people died, while North Korea witnessed crop destruction. In Shenyang, China, air conditioner sales in one company spiked 35-fold over the previous years.\nIn Japan, at least 138 people have died from heat-related causes and at 71,266 required hospitalization for heat stroke through early August. Fatalities have occurred in 28 of the nation's 47\u00a0prefectures. Between 15 and 22 July, 65 people died from the heat, including 11 on 21\u00a0July and 13 on 23\u00a0July. The number of casualties from the heat was the greatest seen in a single-week period since the government started keeping detailed records in 2008. On 17\u00a0July, the Tokyo Fire Department dispatched ambulances 2,900\u00a0times\u2014the greatest number in a single day since the department began in 1936. This was surpassed only four days later, 21\u00a0July, when ambulances were dispatched 3,125\u00a0times. \nThe Japanese Education Ministry issued a warning to schools to take precautions against heat stroke, following the death of one six-year-old boy who was attending an outdoor event. Fewer than half of schools in the country have air conditioning, and government officials discussed extending school holidays for safety. Furthermore, the government considered covering the cost of installing air conditioners in schools. Kyushu Electric Power offered 10\u00a0percent discounts to customers aged 75\u00a0years and older for their August and September bills to facilitate the use of air conditioners.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

It is part of a larger heat wave affecting the northern hemisphere, caused in part by the jet stream being weaker than usual, allowing hot high-pressure air to linger in the same place. According to the European Drought Observatory, most of the areas affected by drought are across northern and central Europe. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the severe heat waves across the northern hemisphere in the summer of 2018, are linked to climate change in Europe, as well as events of extreme precipitation. \nGeneral.\nResearchers at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and World Weather Attribution estimated that climate change more than doubled the overall likelihood of the heat wave, and in some places like Denmark made it up to five times as likely. The heat has built up for two months due to slow and weakened jet stream. One possible cause for the jet stream to be slow and weak relates to global warming. In the polar regions, the average surface temperature is rising more quickly than at mid latitudes in a phenomenon called polar amplification. Many researchers believe a strong polar amplification reduces the strength and changes the pattern of the jet stream, producing patterns like those occurring during the 2018 heat wave. Dr. Michael Mann opined that global warming may be making such heat waves even more likely than the researchers estimated, because at the time of the study the climate models could not fully account for how the jet stream is affected by global warming.\nThe extreme heat was blamed for forest fires and crop failures.\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organization, the severe heat waves across the northern hemisphere in the summer of 2018, are linked to climate change in Europe, as well as events of extreme precipitation. Results were increase in elderly mortality; severe decline in yields; the biggest algae bloom in the Baltic sea for decades, that has poisoned water both for human and animals use; shutdowns of nuclear power plants in Europe, because the water in the rivers, that is used for cooling the reactors, was too warm; and electricity grids crashing across four continents. The impacts were severe, even in the countries considered rich and well prepared to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nBy country.\nAustria.\nThe west and the north of Austria were worst affected by drought; certain areas in these regions experienced up to 85% less rainfall than the 10 year average. Insurance companies estimate the damage as high as 210 million euro.\nBelgium.\nBelgium experienced the second hottest July since regular measurements started in 1833, with an average of 22\u00a0\u00b0C. Precipitation during July was close to normal at the official weather station in Uccle; most regions however received less than 20% of the normal amount of rain for the month, which was especially true for the western part of the country.\nAs a whole, 2 heat waves occurred: the first one between 13 and 27 July (making this the fifth longest heat wave in history) and the second one from 29 July until 7 August. Belgium's official weather service, the KMI, defines a heat wave as a period of at least 5 days with maximum temperatures of 25\u00a0\u00b0C or higher, of which 3 days require a maximum of 30\u00a0\u00b0C or more.\nCroatia.\nZagreb saw 19 nights in a row where temperature did not fall under , breaking the previous record that was set in the 2013 heat wave. Despite the lack of extreme temperatures seen , the 2018 summer saw temperatures averaging above the mean at all official weather stations and the year as a whole was the hottest on record in Zagreb, which has the tenth oldest contiguously monitoring weather station in the world, operating since 1861.\nDenmark.\nThe Danish summer was exceptionally dry and warm, and several records were broken: According to the Danish Meteorological Institute, May 2018 had the highest average temperature ever recorded for the month, beating the old record by (recording began in 1879), the highest number of sunny hours recorded in the month (recording began in 1920), the highest temperature recorded in Copenhagen in the month (recording began in 1879), and it was the driest May in a decade. June had the highest average temperature in 26 years and it was the third driest since recording began in 1920. July was the sunniest ever recorded (recording began in 1920), and it was one of the driest and warmest ever recorded (recording began in 1879). The night between 30 and 31 July was the second-warmest on record.\nHeat increases the risk of cardiac arrest and other serious conditions in people with poor health. On 8 August, Statens Serum Institut released a report that showed an increase of about 250 deaths, primarily among elderly, in the summer of 2018 (peak in late July) compared to the norm. A similar increase was seen in neighbouring countries affected by the heat wave, including other Scandinavian countries.\nThe unusually low water-levels in the Guden\u00e5, the longest Danish river, led to fears that the SS \"Hjejlen\" would run aground. Because of the drought, farmers experienced a significantly reduced harvest. Outside fires and most types of barbecue grills were initially banned locally and later throughout the country due to the risk of fire. A total of 845 wildfires, both small and large, were recorded from 1 May to 5 July, which is about 500 more than the usual. In July alone there were more than 1,000 wildfires, or almost as many as typical of an entire year. Many foreign tourists, apparently unaware of the record-breaking weather, complained about the lack of air conditioning in hotels, which usually is unnecessary.\nFinland.\nFinland experienced very high temperatures and drought, and like its neighbouring Scandinavian countries, several wildfires occurred. Its northernmost municipality of Utsjoki, north of the Arctic Circle, experienced a record-breaking temperature of in July.\nFrance.\nThe French utility company EDF made known that on the morning of 4 August 2018 it had to shut down reactor number one of the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant. This was necessary because the nearby river which is used for cooling water had reached a critical temperature.\nThe white storks in the Alsace region have also been suffering under the drought and heat waves. The 2018 stork generation is generally malnourished. Many are too weak to fly and crash-land when they leave the nest, resulting in fatal injuries like broken legs or wings. But 2018 did not break any temperature records in France.\nGermany.\nBoth April and May set new temperature records as the warmest April and May since modern record-keeping began in 1881. June experienced continued heat, with average temperatures above the 1961-1990 mean, while receiving only 57% of expected rainfall; July experienced average temperatures above the reference period and 52% of the expected rain, making it the fourth-warmest July since modern record-keeping began. The period from April\u2013July is also the hottest and driest on record. The heat also caused the deaths of many freshwater fish due to reduced oxygen levels in rivers and ponds, causing firefighters to pump in more water in order to raise the levels. Near Hamburg, almost five tonnes of dead fish were collected by German authorities.\nOn 26 July, regions in Western Germany hit ; on 31 July 2018, the heat traveled further east where some regions hit . The Rhine and Elbe river recorded high water temperatures causing fish to suffocate, and low water levels made shipping worse. The overnight low in Berlin between 31 July and 1 August was , the city's warmest night since 1905. On 31 July, temperature reached in Bernburg, coming shy of the all-time German temperature record set in 2015. Also on 31 July, the country experienced average highs of .\nGerman farmers have seen the drought affect their crops, potentially ruining harvests and forcing many to harvest early. There are fears many face bankruptcy in the event of a crop failure. The German Farmer's Association have asked the government for over one billion euros in financial aid, as the expected harvest of rapeseed is down by 30% on last year and grain down by 20%.\nMany German nuclear power plants reduced their electricity output, as the river temperatures were too warm to safely absorb the full amount of waste heat from their cooling systems without causing environmental damage (such as fish kills).\nGreece.\nOn 23 July, wildfires started in the areas of Attica, killing 102 people and wounding 172 more, and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 buildings. These are the deadliest wildfires in Greece in living memory. On 24 July a state of emergency was declared near Athens by the government. The cause of the fires is thought to be arson along with the heatwave causing the hot conditions.\nThe Culture Ministry closed the Acropolis between 2:00 and 5:00\u00a0pm. local time on 23 July, since in Greek law, public sites can be closed if temperatures reach to prevent ill health.\nHungary.\nWater levels on the Danube were extremely low, even breaking records in Central Hungary (Ercsi, Dunaf\u00f6ldv\u00e1r, and Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros)\nIreland.\nMet \u00c9ireann recorded the highest June temperature in more than 40 years. \nAn 11-day heatwave was recorded, making it the longest heatwave in 20 years.\nItaly.\nA heat wave struck the entire country, while 8 people died in Genoa.\nLatvia.\nLatvia has seen fires that have destroyed around of land including peat bog, scrubland and forest.\nLithuania.\nThe Lithuanian government declared a state of emergency for drought.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, a heat wave is defined as a period of at least five consecutive days are so called \u2018summery days\u2019 (days on which the daily maximum temperature is at least ), of which at least three days are \u2018tropical\u2019 (days on which the daily maximum temperature is at least ).\nThe Netherlands experienced a heat wave of 13 days starting with 15 July and to 27 July inclusive, the country's longest since the European heat wave of 2006. The highest temperature of was measured in Arcen, Limburg, on 26 July. In many parts of the country authorities were planning for measures in case of water shortages.\nA second heat wave started on 29 July, lasting 10 days until 7 August inclusive.\nNorway.\nThe Norwegian government has imposed water restrictions and the cost of electricity is expected to rise due to a high dependency on hydro-electric generation. In the Banak peninsula in northern Norway a temperature of was recorded on 30 July 2018, which is considered extremely unusual for a region located north of the Arctic Circle. In the first half of July there have been more than 40 forest fires. Oslo experienced its warmest summer day for 80 years with the maximum of \nPoland.\nPolish authorities banned swimming at more than 50 beaches, due to the outbreak of toxic cyanobacteria, forming in warmer waters.\nPortugal and Spain.\nPortugal and Spain experienced record temperatures.\nPortugal's average high temperature was above for 3 consecutive days (40.1 \u00b0C, 40.9 \u00b0C and 41.6 \u00b0C, respectively 2, 3 and 4 August) and 6 different municipalities recorded temperatures at or above with being recorded at Alvega on 4 August.\nLisbon set the highest temperature of on 4 August. \nIn Spain, 9 people died due to the heat wave.\nThe 2018 heat wave in Catalonia took place from 25 July to 6 August.\nAfter three very dry years, drought conditions in Catalonia were widespread, but the rain of the first four months of the 2018 was higher than the climatic average and the agriculture recovered from the water deficit. The spring was not very warm and the heat of summer came suddenly. July was warm. The first heat wave did not produce deaths, but the second one was really deadly: the Public Health Agency of Catalonia (Aspcat) estimated that 23 people died from heat stroke. Most of the deaths were in the same city of Barcelona (eleven), six in the province of Barcelona, four in Tarragona-Terres de l'Ebre, one in Girona and one in Lleida. Ten people suffered heat stroke at home, thirteen on the street and six were at work or doing sport activities. The 'Health care telephone' received 453 calls during the heat wave related to the high temperature. Blood donations fall 40% due to the heat wave.\nAccording to the Meteorological Service of Catalonia, the warmest days were 4 and 5 August. On Saturday 4, 42.3\u00a0\u00b0C were reached at the Ebre Observatory (Roquetes, Baix Ebre), 41.4\u00a0\u00b0C at Benissanet (Ribera d'Ebre) and values from 38\u00a0\u00b0C to 40\u00a0\u00b0C were recorded in various coastal areas and even by the sea. On Sunday 5, very high registers were repeated in the same sectors, up to 41.6\u00a0\u00b0C in Vinebre (Ribera d'Ebre).\nThe minimum temperature also stayed very high during the weekend, with some values around 30\u00a0\u00b0C in the Empord\u00e0 coast (NE of Catalonia) and in the center of the city of Barcelona. The automatic weather station of Portbou (Alt Empord\u00e0) registered two consecutive nights above 30\u00a0\u00b0C, with a minimum record of 31.0\u00a0\u00b0C throughout day 4 (0-24h UTC). The night from Saturday to Sunday was exceptional in Roses (Alt Empord\u00e0), since from midnight the temperature did not fall below 31.9\u00a0\u00b0C, although at night it had measured 29.3\u00a0\u00b0C. Between Saturday and Sunday, the weather observer from L'Estartit (Baix Empord\u00e0) measured the warmest night of its 49 years of data: 29.2\u00a0\u00b0C of minimum temperature. The Raval automatic weather station in the centre of Barcelona city did not drop from 29.8\u00a0\u00b0C during the night from Saturday to Sunday and the minimum temperature was 29.4\u00a0\u00b0C on Saturday 4th. Also in Barcelona city, the station of Can Bruixa (31 years of data) measured a minimum temperature of 29.9\u00a0\u00b0C. These high minimum temperature values represent the highest minimum temperature since 1780 in Barcelona city.\nSweden.\nMay 2018 was the warmest May and July 2018 was the warmest July ever recorded in Sweden. In Stockholm, the previous monthly record of May was recorded in 1993, while the recorded monthly average of May 2018 reached . In Stockholm the monthly average of July reached , making it the hottest month on record. Sweden also experienced widespread drought. More than 50 wildfires, ranging from north of the Arctic Circle to the southernmost county of Scania, occurred and have been called the most serious in the country in modern history by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency. They burned over , with in its central K\u00e5rb\u00f6le region. On 30 July 2018, the Swedish government offered in financial assistance to drought stricken farmers; one farmer said their losses could be around . Extreme forest fires and continuous drought conditions due to high temperatures caused short supplies for animal food, forcing farmers to resort to imports.\nOn 30 July, the Swedish nuclear power plant Ringhals-2 was shut down, as the temperature in Kattegat sea waters exceeded the design limit 25 \u00b0C for the reactor cooling system. Ringhals 2 reopened on 3 August.\nSwitzerland.\nSwitzerland had the warmest April\u2013July period since meteorological records began in 1864. Likewise, 2018 broke the record for the least rainfall in any April\u2013July period since 1864. Fearing wildfires, authorities banned outdoor fires in the canton of Valais and in the Rhine river valley of Grisons. 18 of the 26 cantons have restricted outdoor fires in some way.\nUnited Kingdom.\nFrom the start of June to mid-July the UK underwent their driest summer in modern records. A heatwave was officially declared on 22 June and it caused widespread drought, hosepipe bans and the 2018 United Kingdom wildfires. These series of wildfires worst affected moorland areas of the UK around the Greater Manchester region, the largest of which being at Saddleworth Moor and Winter Hill which together burned over over a period of nearly a month. On 29 June, Northern Ireland Water introduced the first hosepipe ban in Northern Ireland since 1995. The highest temperature reached according to the Met Office was in Faversham, Kent on 26 July.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

It was introduced in 1998 after consultation with a number of tennis players. Its current iteration was first implemented in 2019 and uses a scale of 1 to 5 that accounts for the physiological variances between adults, wheelchair and junior athletes while also taking into account the four climate factors \u2013 air temperature, radiant heat or the strength of the sun, humidity and wind speed \u2013 which affect a player\u2019s ability to disperse heat from their body.\nChanges for 2015.\nFollowing severe criticism of the handling of the 2014 Australian Open, organisers increased the temperature threshold from the 2003 level of and increased the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) threshold from the 2003 level of to allow for more continuous play and fewer stoppages in the future.\nWBGT charts show that the new threshold may not be triggered even if the temperature reaches when there is no humidity.\nWhen the policy is implemented, matches will now be halted after an even number of games in the set, rather than at the conclusion of the set.\nThere will also be a retractable roof available on Margaret Court Arena for the first time.\nHistory.\nIn 1988, Rod Laver Arena opened making the Australian Open the first Grand Slam to feature a retractable roof. The initial heat policy allowed for the roof to be closed when the temperature rose above or at the referee's discretion when the temperature rose above , but only for daytime matches and only once all singles matches could be scheduled inside Rod Laver Arena. This effectively meant that the heat policy could only go in effect in the quarterfinals or later in the tournament.\nOfficials considered closing the roof for the final in 1993 due to a temperature of , but Jim Courier threatened to boycott the match unless the roof remained open.\nThe heat rule was first invoked during the quarterfinal round in 1997.\nIn 1998, a new policy was implemented calling for play on all courts to be stopped if the temperature reached . This was later changed in 2002 to .\nThe 2002 women's final was played in heat, which triggered a 10-minute break between the 2nd and 3rd sets but no halt in play.\nBeginning with the 2003 tournament the policy was changed to and a WBGT of .\nThe new policy was invoked on January 20, 2003 on a day when the temperature reached and the WBGT reached the mark. Play was halted for the minimum 2 hours.\nAfter the extreme heat policy was invoked in consecutive years in 2006 and 2007, the policy was again changed starting in 2008 to allow matches in progress to be halted at the conclusion of the set. Prior to that a match already underway had to be completed. The policy was further changed in 2008 to allow play to be stopped only at the discretion of the tournament referee, rather than relying solely on temperature and WBGT calculations.\nThe policy was invoked several times in 2009, the hottest tournament to date with an average temperature of .\nThe policy was invoked on day 2 of the 2023 tournament was temperatures reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit with a feel of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Play was suspended on all courts that did not have a roof.\nCriticism.\n2014.\nThe extreme heat policy came under criticism during the 2014 Australian Open after ballboys, attendants in the stands, and players were suffering various heat-related illnesses due to four consecutive days with highs between , but organizers claimed the humidity remained low enough on all but one day for the policy not to be enforced; tournament referee Wayne McKewen said that \"While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured that conditions never deteriorated to a point where it was necessary to invoke the extreme heat policy\". Frank Dancevic, who began to hallucinate and collapse during his 6\u20137(12\u201314), 3\u20136, 4\u20136 loss to Beno\u00eet Paire, described the conditions as \"inhumane\" while severely criticising the policy, and Andy Murray voiced his concerns about people's safety, stating that \"it only takes one bad thing to happen\". Ivan Dodig, who also collapsed and was forced to retire, said afterwards that he feared he might die in the extreme conditions. Nine players retired during the second day, while Daniel Gimeno-Traver carried off a ball boy who fainted during his match and Peng Shuai was amongst many throughout the tournament that required medical attention. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Caroline Wozniacki noted that their shoes and water bottles were beginning to melt in the conditions, while Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka said that the heat was affecting their play.\nRoger Federer, however, agreed with the referee's decision, saying that adequate training and preparation should be enough to cope with the weather. Gilles Simon, who was injured prior to the tournament, took a similar view and said that the heat improved his game.\nOn the second day of the tournament the temperature reached . On the third day it reached . On the fourth day it reached . On the fifth day it reached with 6% humidity. Play continued uninterrupted for the second, third, and fifth days and was stopped for 4 hours on the fourth day. For many players the stoppage was closer to 3 hours because they had to complete the set in progress even after the policy went into effect.

Its most popular line-up featured Americans Johnnie Wilder Jr. and Keith Wilder (vocals) of Dayton, Ohio; Englishmen Rod Temperton (keyboards) and Roy Carter (guitar); Swiss Mario Mantese (bass); Czechoslovak Ernest \"Bilbo\" Berger (drums); and Jamaican Eric Johns (guitar).\nThey are known for their singles \"Boogie Nights\", \"The Groove Line\", and \"Always and Forever\".\nBiography.\nHeatwave's mainstream years 1976\u20131982.\nFounding member Johnnie Wilder was an American serviceman based in West Germany when he first began performing; upon his discharge from the US Army, he stayed in Germany. He sang in nightclubs and taverns with an assortment of bands while still enlisted. By mid-year, he decided to relocate to the United Kingdom and through an ad placed in a local paper he linked up with songwriter/keyboardist Rod Temperton.\nTouring the London nightclub circuit billed as \"Chicago's Heatwave\" during the mid-1970s allowed them to refine their sound, adding a funk groove to disco beats. In search of a fuller sound vocally, Johnnie Wilder called upon his brother Keith Wilder (who was performing in a local band in Dayton, Ohio) to join the band on vocals. The group signed to GTO Records in 1976 (Epic Records would handle GTO's releases in the states). They were paired in the studio with GTO house producer/session guitarist Barry Blue and rhythm guitarist Jesse Whitten. Rhythm guitarist Roy Carter replaced Whitten after Whitten was stabbed to death. They began creating their first album \"Too Hot to Handle\" in the fall of 1976.\nTheir third single, \"Boogie Nights\" from their debut album, in 1977 reached No. 2 on the British popular music charts in January and in America in November. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA. The group's debut album, \"Too Hot to Handle\", was released in the spring of 1977, giving Heatwave a No. 11 on the Hot 200 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B charts, while the next single, the soul ballad \"Always and Forever\", reached No. 18 on the Hot 100 in April 1978 and No. 2 on the R&amp;B charts. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA.\nContinuing to use Barry Blue's production skills, Heatwave released their second album \"Central Heating\" in April 1977. Lead single \"The Groove Line,\" reached No. 7 on the Hot 100 in July 1978. The single was certified platinum by the RIAA.\nDuring the late 1970s, the band changed. At first Eric Johns quit the band and Billy Jones was his replacement as guitarist. Then Rod Temperton quit the band. Although Temperton would continue writing new songs for Heatwave, he soon became better-known for his songwriting for other artists, penning award-winning songs for some of funk's biggest names, including Rufus, The Brothers Johnson and George Benson. He also wrote for Herbie Hancock and Quincy Jones, but his most famous partnership remains the one forged with Michael Jackson, writing three songs for each of Jackson's first two Epic albums \"Off the Wall\" (1979) and \"Thriller\" (1982), including their title tracks.\nDespite these changes, Heatwave were about to return to the studio when Mantese attended a party at Elton John's house in London. He was with his girlfriend, who decided to go home early from the party, reason unknown. When Mantese arrived home, she was furious with him, perhaps from an incident that happened at the party and stabbed him. The knife hit him in the heart and for several minutes, he was clinically dead. When, after several months, he awoke from coma, he was blind, mute and paralysed in his entire body. To date, he has no memory of this tragic event. He decided not to press charges against his girlfriend, and moved in with her after leaving the hospital. Mantese was replaced by bassist Derek Bramble. Adding keyboardist Calvin Duke to the group, and now working with new producer Phil Ramone, Heatwave cut \"Hot Property\", released in May 1979.\nAround this time Heatwave performed \"Keep Tomorrow for Me\" used over the end credits of the action comedy \"Escape to Athena\". Composed by Barry Blue and written by Rod Temperton with some orchestrations by Christodoulous, the song is considered by some to be one of the group's best but never got a wide release due to the rights being locked up with Lew Grade's ITC Entertainment. The film performed poorly at the box office and the proposed soundtrack (with a score composed by Lalo Schifrin) was cancelled except in Japan where the song was released on the soundtrack to the film under its Japanese title \"Offsides 7\" and only on vinyl in that country.\nDuring the spring of 1979, Johnnie Wilder, Jr., suffered injuries in an auto accident while visiting family and friends in Dayton, Ohio. Although he survived, the accident left him paralysed from the neck down and unable to continue performing live with the group, though he did continue to perform vocals in the studio. After the accident, Johnnie remained a co-producer of the group, along with Blue.\nDuring 1980, Heatwave recorded the \"Candles\" album, with Temperton again providing the songs, except stand out track \"All I Am\", written by Blue's former writing partner Lynsey de Paul who was asked by Wilder to contribute the song. The group recruited James Dean \"J.D.\" Nicholas, who later became a member of the Commodores, to sing additional lead vocals in studio and perform live with them.\nHeatwave's November single \"Gangsters of the Groove\" was a popular music success, scoring number twenty-one on the US R&amp;B chart (failing to make the Hot 100 because of the anti-disco backlash), and number 19 in the United Kingdom early in the New Year. But the album peaked at number 71 in the United States in December 1980.\nHeatwave's 1982 LP, \"Current\", marked yet another new era for the band, as they returned to producer Blue. The album managed number 156 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, although it scored the band a number 21 success on the R&amp;B charts, where Heatwave continued to be a strong presence. A Rod Temperton penned single, \"Lettin' It Loose,\" proved a minor success during August.\nDerek Bramble quit the band at the end of 1982, like Roy Carter, for a career in production (he would go on to work with David Bowie on 1984s \"Tonight\" LP, and later masterminded Jaki Graham's breakthrough). J.D. Nicholas left to replace Lionel Richie as the lead singer of the Commodores.\nBreak-up period.\nIn approximately 1986, Keith Wilder and Roy Carter sought the services of Central Line guitarists/songwriters Henri Defoe and Michael Finbarr Murphy (the latter having also recently produced \"Unknown Quantity,\" consisting of the 3 backing vocalists and dancers in the \"Chain Reaction\" hit music video by Diana Ross, which also featured Michael on guitar). Keith and Roy wanted to enlist them for a tour of the British US Air Force Bases. Michael's distant cousin, Alan Murphy, the now-deceased one-time guitarist for Kate Bush, Go West, and Level 42 also expressed interest in working with Heatwave as a band, though it would never materialize.\nPost-1988 Heatwave.\nSilent as a band since early 1983, Heatwave reconvened in a new line-up to record and release the album \"The Fire\" in 1988. However, Keith Wilder was the only original member of the band present in this incarnation (although Billy Jones, who had joined the band in the late 1970s returned as well). Meanwhile, that same year, Johnnie Wilder released a solo spiritual album \"My Goals on Light\". The Wilder brothers once again teamed up the following year for the gospel album, \"Sound of Soul\". None of these late 1980s albums sold well, but Heatwave's recognition was revitalised in 1991, when a remix version of their \"Mind Blowing Decisions\" charted in the UK. By the mid to late 1980s, Keith Wilder was joined by bassist Dave Williamson and vocalist Donovan Blackwood and in the 1990s had again reformed the band. Joined by keyboardists Kevin Sutherland and Byron Byrd, guitarist Bill Jones, and original drummer Ernest Berger, the reborn Heatwave launched an American tour with a live album recorded at the Greek Theater in Hollywood, arriving in 1997.\nDeaths.\nJohnnie Wilder died in his sleep at his home in Dayton, Ohio on 13 May 2006.\nOn 5 October 2016, Temperton's death was announced after what was described by his music publisher as \"a brief aggressive battle with cancer\". Temperton had died at the age of 66 in London the previous week and his funeral had already taken place. The exact date of his death was not announced.\nKeith Wilder (born Keith Edward Wilder on 20 December 1951 in Dayton, Ohio) died on 29 October 2017, at the age of 65.", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

Wildfires were also reported in Epping Forest in Essex, the Dorset coast, the valleys of southern Wales and Tentsmuir Forest in Scotland.\nEcology.\nFollowing declines in the summer of 2012 due to wet and windy conditions, butterfly numbers saw a surge due to the prolonged warm weather.

It caused widespread drought, hosepipe bans, crop failures, and a number of wildfires. These wildfires worst affected northern moorland areas around the Greater Manchester region, the largest was at Saddleworth Moor and another was at Winter Hill, together these burned over of land over a period of nearly a month.\nA heat wave was officially declared on 22 June, with Scotland and Northern Ireland recording temperatures above for the first time since the July 2013 heat wave. The British Isles were in the middle of a strong warm anticyclone inside a strong northward meander of the jet stream, this was part of the wider 2018 European heat wave. The Met Office declared summer 2018 the joint hottest on record together with 1976, 2003 and 2006.\nWeather earlier in 2018.\nSpring started with record cold in early March with the 2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave. There were three spells of summer heat afterwards, starting in mid-April. The April 2018 heatwave began on 18 and 19 April. St James's Park in London recorded the country's hottest April day in nearly 70 years when temperatures reached . The unseasonably hot weather lasted for four days. On 22 April, the hottest London Marathon ever was recorded, with the temperature reaching . No national records were broken, but many places set local record high temperatures for April.\nAfter a cooler period from the end of April, temperatures started to rise again during early May. The May Day bank holiday was the hottest on record, with west London recording . A few days later, temperatures began to fall, but were still above average. Temperatures began to rise even higher towards the end of May. It sparked violent thunderstorms leading to flash flooding, giving some parts of the country their first measurable precipitation during May. On 27 May, of torrential rain fell at Winterbourne, West Midlands, causing a flash flood. The majority of the country was hot and sunny. May 2018 was one of the warmest and sunniest on record in the UK.\nBefore the heat wave, anticyclonic conditions prevailed across the UK. May and early June had been much warmer and drier than average, the latter being the driest since 1925 due to a persistently strong Azores High. This high-pressure block prevented Atlantic low-pressure weather systems from reaching the British Isles.\nSummer heat wave.\nThe heat wave began on 23 June 2018 as high pressure built across the UK. Temperatures gradually rose, and new records were set in towns and cities across the British Isles. These include Glasgow in Scotland, Shannon in Ireland and both Belfast and Castlederg in Northern Ireland.\nThis temperature rise was part of a heat wave that spanned the entire Northern Hemisphere. The heat wave had seen the hottest night ever recorded on Earth in Oman, with the lowest temperature recorded at , and the deaths of at least 33 people in Canada.\nWildfires began to break out across England. The two largest fires broke out at Saddleworth Moor on 25 June, and at Winter Hill on 28 June, the former being England's largest in living memory. As of September 2018, arrests were made on the charge of arson, yet the cause of these fires was undetermined. However, the factor that allowed the fires to establish was the persistently hot and breezy weather conditions. This dried out vegetation and the underlying peat, allowing it to easily burn.\nOn 2 July, forecasters predicted that high pressure would continue over the UK and that the heat wave could continue for another two weeks. On 5 July, a weak weather front arrived from the west, but was mostly halted over Ireland and the Irish Sea. This caused some scattered showers over the Pennines, and a thunderstorm that caused flash floods in Tunbridge Wells. The weather also affected roads nationwide, and gritters were mobilised due to the asphalt concrete softening under the extreme heat. In Heaton, Newcastle, a man sank into a melted road and required a rescue from firefighters, and a bin lorry sank into a road in Newbury, Berkshire.\nOn 10 July, a weak cold front crossed Britain from north to south, bringing low cloud levels and scattered showers. However, this cool air was quickly heated by the sun the next day, increasing temperatures yet again. The Met Office announced that the highest temperature on 23 July was , recorded at Santon Downham in Suffolk.\nEffects on the economy.\nThe long period of dry warm weather, although with unpleasant levels of humidity, strongly boosted the domestic tourism trade during this period. The official Visit Britain body forecast the number of international visitors to the UK would increase by around 15% from the USA alone, as the effect of the worldwide Royal Wedding publicity fed through into fine summer weather and late holiday bookings. Hotels in competing Mediterranean resorts, such as Ibiza, were forced to slash their prices as demand from British tourists declined sharply as people decided to holiday in the British Isles. Remoter resorts and destinations benefited from visitors' attempts to escape the domestic crowds, and rural Ireland reported a dramatic increase in tourism with an average of 70% occupancy rates at smaller establishments.\nMany companies concerned with outdoor activities reported the usual boost in sales that comes from a good summer, and estate agents reported that the warm dry summer was also helping their industry. Fresh produce growers such as the soft fruit sector were largely unaffected by the lack of rain, with British Summer Fruits chairman Nick Marsto telling \"Horticulture Week\" trade magazine that the... \"soft-fruit sector has largely avoided any adverse effects.\nHealth effects.\nThe heatwave added to pressure on the NHS, on A&amp;E departments and elsewhere. Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said, \"I am very worried about the impact on the NHS of this summer. We know that this hot weather, (...) affects very elderly, vulnerable people. We know that asthma sufferers suffer particularly badly in the weather. [Ashworth mentioned his first hand experiences shadowing a hospital consultant] with lots of elderly vulnerable people being admitted to A&amp;E, lying on trolleys because there's no beds in the hospital\".\nThere were fears of over 1,000 excess deaths during the heat wave. The Environmental Audit Committee of MP's reported fears 7,000 heat-related UK deaths annually by 2050 unless the government acts promptly. Chair of the committee, Mary Creagh said, \"The government must stop playing pass the parcel with local councils and the NHS and develop a strategy to protect our ageing population from this increasing risk\". At risk, groups include elderly people, small children and people with heart and/or lung conditions. There were calls for government regulations to protect an ageing population from the effects of heat, effects include increased risk of death.\nDuring the 2003 European heat wave in some areas of the UK there were 42% increased deaths in nursing homes and the MP's wanted hospitals and care homes to be inspected to find out if they could cope with extreme heat. The TUC and others called for regulations about maximum workplace temperatures. Frances O'Grady of the TUC stated, \"With heatwaves becoming more common, we need clear and sensible rules to protect working people. We've had legal minimum temperatures at work for a long time, which work very well. The government must now act quickly on the recommendation by MPs for maximum limits on how hot workplaces can get\".\nDress codes for work and school uniform policy should be relaxed during heatwaves to improve work productivity and school learning. Ministers withdrew money for climate change adaptation officers in local authorities. Lack of \"joined-up thinking\" between government departments and lack of communication between the government and the public added to the death toll. Heatwave alerts are put out only if temperatures are over 30\u00a0\u00b0C, but heat-related deaths start at 25 degrees. There were excess deaths during the 2018 heat wave but the cause is not yet known.\nDrought.\nOn 29 June, Northern Ireland Water introduced the first hosepipe ban in Northern Ireland since 1995. Other water companies also had supply problems, such as United Utilities, with more than usual being used on 1 July.\nOn 5 July in the Republic of Ireland a state of absolute drought was declared because there had been no rainfall at 96% of its weather stations in the previous two weeks. On 6 July, the first nationwide hosepipe ban in the republic's history was imposed. On 19 July, the Northern Ireland ban was lifted.\nCrop failures.\nThe heat wave affected many crops, and there was concern for the wheat and barley harvests. Cases included wheat dying of drought before it could set seed, and withering of grass intended for livestock grazing, so that dairy cattle had to be grazed on land intended to grow hay or silage for winter feed for the cows. By July, president of the National Farmers Union Guy Smith described the crops as \"being parched to the bone\". Smith further discussed the risk posed by depleted reservoirs that would normally be used for irrigation, and stated that there was a potential risk to vegetable production should the weather continue.\nSporting events.\nA number of sporting events experienced unusual conditions as a result of the heatwave. The 2018 Open Championship which was held from 19\u201322 July at Carnoustie, Scotland was played with unusually brown, dry and sunbaked fairways and brown rough. The India cricket team toured England during the heat wave, with their tour match against Essex being reduced from four days to three because of the high temperatures.\nArchaeological discoveries.\nThe dry weather caused patterns of vegetation to be revealed, indicative of Roman and pre-Roman settlements. Drainage ditches that had surrounded Iron Age hill forts and Roman settlements became filled in once those settlements were no longer in use, meaning they have a deeper quantity of topsoil and, thus, retain moisture for plants for longer. The use of aerial images to identify arch\u00e6ological sites through cropmarks has been a methodology employed by archaeologists for decades. The National Monuments Service of the Irish Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht said that the increased use of aerial drone photography and the exceptional dry weather was leading to some remarkable discoveries.\nThe Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales observed such indications of historical settlements across Wales, including at in , at the Cross Oak Hillfort near Talybont-on-Usk, at Caerwent, Monmouthshire and newly-discovered settlements near Magor, Monmouthshire and Langstone, Newport.\nSimilarly, the National Monuments Service of the Irish Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht announced the discovery of a possible henge, in diameter, near the UNESCO World Heritage Site of , near Newgrange, County Meath.\nStatistics.\nRainfall.\nThe drought conditions were not as bad as the mid 1970s drought. June was notably dry, especially after a very dry May. The worst affected regions were England and Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland also had below average rainfall, but this was unexceptional. Some places had no rain at all.\nTemperature.\nThe Met Office considers the summer of 2018 to be tied with 1976, 2003 and 2006 as the hottest summer on record for the United Kingdom as a whole, with average temperatures of . In England, average temperatures for the summer were the highest on record at , narrowly ahead of the average in 1976. However, in the CET records (Central England Temperature records that go back to 1659), 2018 comes in 5th behind 2003, 1995, 1826 and 1976.\nJune.\nIn Wales and Northern Ireland, June 2018 was the warmest June ever recorded and in England and Scotland, June 2018 ranks within the five warmest on record. In the Central England region, the CET is a long running temperature series, with records back to 1659. 2018's temperature was , meaning it ranks as the 18th warmest June recorded in England in the past 359 years, also being the warmest since 1976.\nJuly.\nJuly 2018 was again, a very hot month, with the Central England Temperature showing that July 2018 is the fourth-hottest month recorded since 1659. It also was 138% more sunny than average being the 6th sunniest July since 1929.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The phenomenon began affecting Italy and Turkey on 17 June and expanded into Greece and the rest of the Balkans, Hungary and Ukraine on 18 June. The costs of the heat wave were estimated at 2\u00a0billion euros.\nApril 2007.\nMainz, Germany recorded an average high of for April, the strongest deviation (+) from the 1989-2018 average of any month. It was also the first calendar month without any measured precipitation since February 1959. A high of was reached on 14 April.\nJune 2007.\nUp until 21 June, temperatures generally hovered around in most of the aforementioned countries; however, starting on 22 June, temperatures skyrocketed in this entire region. From this point on Greece, Italy, Albania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania and Turkey experienced record-breaking temperatures in a situation unprecedented even for these nations, typically used to conditions of extreme heat.\nDuring the weekend of 23\u201324 June and on 25 June, temperatures soared to . By 26 June, however, Greece seemed to bear the brunt of the heatwave with temperatures in Athens reaching . The same day, Greece's national power consumption set a new record. Parts of Greece, including neighbourhoods in Athens, suffered from power outages due to high electricity demand and heat damage to the grid. Explosions from overheating transmission towers were implicated in the forest fires ravaging the country. The discomfort was exacerbated by high night-time temperatures, which exceeded averages by up to , and remained at very high levels for more than half of the 2007 summer.\nMore than 200 people were hospitalized for heat-related treatment and 18 people died from heat exhaustion. By 28 June northerly winds started blowing from the northwest and temperatures finally began falling, reaching a cooler . Nonetheless, at a time when everyone believed that the worst part was over, more than 100 fires erupted across the country. Two people perished in the village of Aghia, near the city of Larissa. In the evening of that same day a major wildfire broke out in Mount Parnitha near Athens. By the dawn of 29 June, a significant part of the popular Parnitha National Park had turned into ashes. Temperatures fell by as much as and the worst heatwave since records began came to an end leaving Greece reeling upon its disastrous effects.\nJuly 2007.\nBy late July, temperatures again rose to more than in Southern Europe, impacting agriculture, electricity supply, forestry and human health. From 21 to 25 July, temperatures reached or exceeded . Over 500 deaths in Hungary were attributed to the heatwave. Major wildfires destroyed large forested areas across the region. Six people (including two Canadair pilots) lost their lives while trying to extinguish the flames in Greece. The country's electricity grid nearly collapsed due to exceptional demand for air conditioning. Hundreds of tourists were stranded on the beaches of Apulia, in Southeastern Italy, and had to be rescued by boats.\nIn Bulgaria, six people were killed in the fires that started on 22 July. An estimated 1,530 fires broke out between 20 and 24 July, three times the yearly average. During the largest fire near Stara Zagora, of pine forest burned for three days, as firefighters were unable to control the fire by conventional means. Strong winds and the extremely dry air quickly sparked new fires. The government requested help from Russia, and Be-200 amphibious water bombers finally managed to contain the blaze near Stara Zagora.\nAugust 2007.\nIn the beginning of August, the Dalmatian coast in Croatia was hit by severe fires, especially in the surroundings of Dubrovnik.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The heat wave ran during the months of May and June, which continued to September in Japan.\nIndia.\nHeat-related deaths were reported from the capital New Delhi, northern Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. After three days of intense heat with temperatures hovering about 40\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0(104\u00a0\u00b0F), New Delhi was relieved as the temperature slid down to 37.2\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0(99.0\u00a0\u00b0F). Meanwhile, the temperature soared to more than 46\u00a0\u00b0C (115\u00a0\u00b0F) at several places in northern Madhya Pradesh, with Datia turning out to be the hottest at 48\u00a0\u00b0C (118\u00a0\u00b0F).\nMore than 120 peacocks died in Tughlaqabad Fort and Surajkund due to the heat; additionally, reports of severe water shortages were common. A total of 400 peacocks died in Madhya Pradesh, about 200 of those in Haryana and Punjab alone.\nThe cotton crop in Punjab was severely affected by the heat wave. Meanwhile, the persisting heat wave in various parts of Chandigarh rendered milk cattle dry. When the day temperature hovered around +48\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0(118\u00a0\u00b0F), milk supply to various milk plants of cooperative unions went down by per day. In addition, milk collection by private-sector plants was reduced by during the same period.\nBangladesh.\nComing at the end of May, a heat wave left at least 25 people dead. According to hospital sources most victims of the heat were rice farmers working in terraces exposed to the blazing sun for long periods. Nearly 200 people, including several children, were admitted to hospitals with symptoms of heat stroke. According to the meteorological office in Dhaka many northern towns showed day temperatures reaching over +40\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0(104\u00a0\u00b0F), which is not normal in the Bangladeshi summer. Additionally, there was a high level of humidity.\nNepal.\nA heat wave affected the livelihood of a large number of poverty-stricken families who depend on day outdoor labour done outdoors, such as constructing roads, driving rickshaws, selling vegetables, making quilts and farming. According to the government's Department of Meteorology the temperature in Nepalganj got up as high as +44\u00a0\u00b0C (111\u00a0\u00b0F). It is estimated that at least 11 people died.\nPakistan.\nThe heat wave over Pakistan was claimed to have brought the death toll there up to 192. The meteorological department registered a record maximum temperature of +52\u00a0\u00b0C (126\u00a0\u00b0F) in Sibi. Four people died as the temperature in Lahore touched +48\u00a0\u00b0C (118\u00a0\u00b0F) on 9 June, which was a record for the previous 78 years.\nRussia.\nThe heat waves hit Russia at the end of May. The temperature in Moscow reached +32.9\u00a0\u00b0C (91.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on 27 May. The Russian capital had not seen such a sustained heat wave for 128 years. On 28 May an absolute temperature record for May was set, breaking the record of +31.8\u00a0\u00b0C (89.2\u00a0\u00b0F) that had been registered back in 1891. The heat also affected agriculture, wiping out about 5,000\u00a0km2 of spring sown fields.\nAnimals at Moscow Zoo found it hard to keep cool. Staff had to prevent walruses from bathing in their pool because the water was too warm for them.\nChina.\nBeijing opened up its warren of old air raid shelters to help people escape from the heat. The heat also set off explosives at a chemical plant in Shanxi. The explosions injured hundreds of people nearby.\nJapan.\nMost of Japanese cities are highest level of an average temperature, since May to September. According to Meteorological Agency of Japan confirm report, the highest temperature recorded on Celsius 40.9 degrees hitting in Kumagaya, Saitama and Tajimi, Gifu, Celsius 40.3 degrees hitting in Koshigaya, Saitama, on 16 August. And above Celsius 29 degrees of average temperature points are Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Takamatsu, Shikoku. In September, major Japanese cities are recorded to high temperature of Celsius 32 to 37 degrees levels, with highest level of an average temperature in September, since 1868.

Very warm air pushed northward west of the Great Lakes region, and subsequently spread eastward. The intense poleward air mass movement was propelled by an unusually intense low level southerly jet that stretched from Louisiana to western Wisconsin. Once this warm surge inundated the area, a remarkably prolonged period of record setting temperatures ensued.\nNOAA's National Climate Data Center reported that over 7,000 daily record high temperatures were tied or broken from 1 March through 27 March. In some places the temperature exceeded . For instance, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the highest temperature recorded was on March 21; in Chicago a high of 87\u00a0\u00b0F was also recorded on that same day. Records were broken in unusual ways. Chicago, for example, saw temperatures above every day between March 14\u201318, breaking records on all five days. Chicago would go on to record eight days at or above 80\u00a0\u00b0F during the month, with many suburban areas recording an additional day in the 80s on March 19 (that day, the city only tied its record high of ). In context, the National Weather Service's Chicago branch noted that Chicago typically averages only one day in the 80's in April. And only once in 140 years of weather observations has April produced as many 80\u00a0\u00b0F days as this March. \nTemperature records across much of southern Canada also were shattered. Some of the most impressive readings came from Nova Scotia on March 22, when the mercury climbed to at a climate station in Lake Major, making it the highest March temperature recorded in Nova Scotia, and the third highest March temperature recorded in Canada. That same day, the temperature hit at Western Head, Nova Scotia. The heat reached as far east as Cape Breton Island, with the temperature climbing to at Sydney, Nova Scotia, on March 22, a place historically surrounded by ice-jammed waters, frigid winds, and snow in March. The week of March 18 also set record temperatures in Manitoba and much of Ontario as well as into the Maritime Provinces. Non-severe thunderstorms were reported on the evening hours of March 21, through to the early morning hours March 22 into northern Ontario.\nIn addition, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data show that the atmospheric pattern was so persistent that much of the Midwest and Northeast, and up into Ontario, had temperature departures over periods of several days to a week or more of magnitudes which would be unusual even for a single day. Averaged over the seven-day period from March 16 to March 22 inclusive, nearly the entire area of the Midwest and Northeast U.S. and most of Ontario and Quebec had temperatures or more above the 1981-2010 average. Even more dramatically, most of Iowa and Minnesota, all of Wisconsin and Michigan, and most of southeastern Ontario had seven-day mean temperatures more than above the climatological average for the same period.\nAn high at Madison, Wisconsin in early March was above average and followed an overnight low of , above normal the daily high being more than seven standard deviations above the mean. The absolute temperature and departure statistically would be equivalent to a mid-July high at that station in excess of ; the highest temperature recorded there was at least once during the heat waves of the middle 1930s.\nThe warm weather was also responsible for several early-season tornado touchdowns, such as the EF3 that struck Dexter, Michigan, near Ann Arbor.\nCauses.\nA contributing factor to the unprecedented warmth was a warmer than average winter with below-average snowfall across the CONUS, meaning less thermal energy was required to heat the atmosphere.\nThe primary, immediate cause of the heat wave was a buckled jet stream caused by an abnormally strong high pressure ridge atop the Eastern United States and an unusually strong and slow-moving low pressure trough across the West, which brought with it below-average temperatures and snow. The tight pressure gradient allowed for an intense southerly jet to form, which transported warm, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico northward, with the moisture having an insulating effect during the night. The ridge also deflected storm systems northward away from the Eastern U.S. and kept skies clear, allowing further daytime radiative heating to occur.\nIn addition, the North Atlantic oscillation was in a strongly positive phase during the heat wave, which often foreshadows above average temperatures in the Eastern U.S. The Madden-Julian oscillation also entered a phase correlated with warm temperatures in the U.S. East.\nContinued warmth.\nOn June 25, Denver, Colorado, tied its all-time high with a temperature of . On the same day, at least two readings of were recorded in Kansas. The heat was so strong that Alamosa, Colorado, broke its daily record for six consecutive days. In Galveston, Texas, the earliest day ever was recorded, on June 25.\nIn northern Canada, Fort Good Hope, Northwest Territories had five consecutive days of or higher, from June 21 to June 25, possibly the longest heat wave in Canada at that moment.\nOn June 26, Hill City, Kansas, was the warmest point in the United States, with the thermometer climbing to .\nThousands of records were being broken again on June 28. Fort Wayne, Indiana, tied its all-time record high with while Indianapolis broke its monthly record, at . More monthly records that day included St. Louis, Missouri, at and Little Rock, Arkansas, at .\nThe scorching heat continued on June 29, when Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia, recorded their highest June temperatures ever, at . Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, each tied their all-time records, at and respectively.\nThe continued heat following the lack of snow the previous winter was a contributor to the record-shattering 2012 North American drought.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

They were a progressive pop harmony group, doing local gigs, playing cover versions of the popular artists of the day with lead vocals shared between Terry and John with a few songs from Richard.\nIn the winter of 1969, Johnny Edward Entertainment Agency was looking for pop groups, Heatwave auditioned and the band was asked to sign that same night. Touring the country as a four-piece, playing four sets a night, they became a tight vocal harmony band with a solid dance beat, often 'opening' for 'name' acts while earning a large fan following.\nJohn Edward believed the band needed a stronger voice to be a successful recording group and set up auditions with an advert in the \"Melody Maker\". Peter Allatt (lead vocals &amp; percussion) then completed the group as a five-piece. Playing one night stands around the country, The Pheasantry (London), California Ballroom (Dunstable) and the Cavern Club (Liverpool), where they have a brick in the Wall of Fame, were but three of many favourite venues played. The band's stage gear was made by The Carnaby Cavern in Ganton Street, just off Carnaby Street. A stage act was later suggested whereupon, Martin incorporated a pyrotechnic display of fire eating.\nHeatwave was invited to appear on the Terry Wogan radio show without having the usual audition and, from that, were given the opportunity to record for the Dave Cash, Kenny Everett, Dave Lee Travis, Jimmy Young and Radio One Club shows \u2013 Heatwave became one of the most-oft heard 'live' professional bands on BBC Radio One between 1969 and 1970.\nOn 16 October 1970, Heatwave released \"Sister Simon (Funny Man)\" b/w \"Rastus Ravel (Is a Mean Old Man)\" (PEN 738) on the Larry Page Penny Farthing Records label.

There were also water shortages with drought worsening the impact of the heat wave.\nBackground.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department, a heat wave is defined as a maximum air temperature of at least 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) in the plains and 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in hilly regions, and is also declared when the maximum temperature remains 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) or higher, irrespective of the normal maximum temperature.\nIn India, the month of May is typically one of the hottest and driest. In 2016, the heat came early, with 111 heat-related casualties reported by 8 April. Most of the heat waves in India since 1998 are associated with droughts; a major drought and worsening water shortages had affected around 330 million people by 23 May. The high temperatures, combined with other atmospheric disturbances, led to thunderstorms and lightning strikes in some states, leading to deaths, the destruction of houses and uprooted trees, as well as affecting crops and farm animals. The monsoon rains that would provide some relief were nearly one week behind the scheduled date, and would not reach the north until several weeks later.\nMore than 20,000 people have died of heat wave-related causes in India since 1992; the heat wave in 2015 was one of the five deadliest on record.\nImpact.\nThe highest temperatures typically occur in May or June prior to the annual monsoon. Increasing temperatures and more frequent heat waves appear to be a result of human-induced climate change. In response to these more frequent events, many cities across India have implemented plans to warn people of the dangers of excessive heat.\nWhile the number of deaths was relatively small, those most likely to die from heat exposure were labourers who were forced to work outside despite a government ban limiting work during the hottest part of the day. Schools were also ordered to extend the summer holiday to reduce the risk to children. The greatest impact of the extreme temperatures were on crops, with hundreds of millions of people affected by the failure of food crops.\nThe government hospital in Phalodi reported 500 patient visits, double the average number; many of those patients were complaining of diarrhea. To combat the heat, people drink water, but in 2016 the heat was coupled with drought. Lack of adequate water leads to dehydration and consumption of contaminated water leads to diarrhea. It is likely that the death totals were significantly underestimated due to a lack of systematic data collection.\nHealth effects.\nA heat wave usually causes severe health conditions and death. Heat stroke and heat stress are two of these adverse effects. Also, the heat wave was the main cause of the prevalence of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in hospitals. The humidity and temperature increases caused harmful health effects, especially for vulnerable people such as the elderly, children, outdoor workers and people in poor living conditions. Indian people's health were affected indirectly by water scarcity for both drinking and grazing purposes. That led to heat-related health challenges such as dehydration hyperthermia. Therefore, Indian people suffered from dizziness and organ dysfunction. In Phalodi, people suffered from diarrhea and high body temperature.\nThe mortality rate differs in India during different months and in different cities. At the beginning of April 2016, more than 100 people died from heat. In the three Indian cities of Delhi, Telangana and Odisha\u00a0more than 600 died in just one month. In the region of Bihar, 180 people died, and a large number were affected by heat stroke. The National Disaster Management Authority Government of India shows that 1,111 died because of the heat wave in 2016.\nLocal response.\nIn Orissa, Maharashtra and Gujarat, programs were launched to educate people on hydration, providing shelters and training medical workers. In Andhra Pradesh, government workers distributed water and buttermilk, whilst TV and newspaper adverts urged people to stay indoors during peak hours.\nSchools were shut down in Odisha and Telangana weeks ahead of summer holidays. Hospitals stopped performing surgeries. A ban on day-time (9am - 6pm) cooking was imposed to prevent accidental fires. India's Supreme Court ordered the Indian Premier League out of Maharashtra, stopping 13 cricket matches because of the amount of water needed to prepare pitches.\nThere were numerous calls for more government action. Leading Indian economists, rights activists and academics sent an open letter to the government expressing the same. In his monthly radio address, Modi pledged 20 billion rupees ($400 million) to deal with the crisis.\nIn Maharastra, the local government's response to the portable water shortage was to supply water to its city via train. The train became known as \"Jaldoot\" (Hindi), meaning \"water saviour\". In a single nine-hour journey the train was able to deliver 2.5 million litres of water.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The heat wave began on July 4, 1911 and didn't cease until July 15. In Nashua, New Hampshire, the temperature peaked at 106\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C). In New York City alone, 158 people and 600 horses died.\nDescription.\nThroughout June, the temperature had been consistent with what normally was felt during New England summers, but starting in July, dry air which originated from the southern great plains began to flow into Canada before being swept south toward the east coast. The hot wind suppressed cooler ocean breezes, and this caused the temperature to rise so suddenly and dramatically that in Providence there was an 11 degree rise in temperature in a half hour.\nThe area between Pennsylvania and Maine was reportedly most affected by the heat. During the 11 days, temperature records were set all over New England. In Boston, the temperature rose to 104\u00b0 (40\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 4, an all-time record high that still stands today. A statewide all time heat record for Maine was set in Bridgton, at .\nToronto saw temperatures as high as 103\u00b0 (39.4\u00a0\u00b0C) to 105\u00b0 (40.6\u00a0\u00b0C), the highest temperature until 1936.\nThe heatwave was finally ended by a severe thunderstorm, which traveled across the Northeast and killed an additional five people.\nHeatwave impacts.\nThe first day of the heatwave caused crowds in major cities to form around thermometers so they could watch the temperature rise. Pedestrians in these crowds reportedly began to collapse from heat stroke as the day went by. By night time, mothers walked the street with crying infants hoping to keep them awake in fear that if they slept in their cribs they would not awaken.\nAs the heat wave's second day began, 17 people had died from drowning alone after trying to swim in order to escape the heat. By the time the sun had risen on July 5, industry had come to a standstill. Throughout the region factories were closed and mail service was suspended. Due to the temperature indoors many began sleeping outside either on roofs of apartments or on sidewalks with at least 5,000 people sleeping on the Boston Common alone.\nBesides deaths caused directly by the heat, it was reported that in every major city affected by the heatwave that the temperatures had been driving people insane and causing suicides. One such example reported by The New London Day, was of an elderly Boston man named Jacob Seegar who reportedly was driven so insane by the heat that he killed himself with a revolver in order to escape it.\nDue to the excessive heat rail lines had become melted and bent.\nThe death toll continued to rise until finally a sudden thunderstorm brought a wave of relief, soon after which temperatures returned to their normal levels for good.\nThe 1911 heat wave is considered the most deadly weather related disaster in the history of New England. In Philadelphia alone, 158 people were reported to have died from the heatwave and across the north east 200 people were reported to have drowned while swimming in an attempt to escape the heat.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The hot season arrived unusually early in the year and extended into April, affecting a large part of India's northwest and Pakistan. The heatwave has combined with a drought, with rainfall being only a quarter to a third of normal. The heat wave is remarkable for occurring during a La Ni\u00f1a event. Delhi and Banda in Uttar Pradesh recorded 49.2 degree celsius on May 15,2022. Jacobabad recorded 51 degree celsius on May 15,2022.\nSeveral cities across India had high temperatures over , with Wardha rising to . The heatwave has also been felt in neighboring Pakistan, where the city of Nawabshah recorded a high temperature of and Jacobabad and Sibi reaching . Pakistan's Minister of Climate Change Sherry Rehman described it as a \"spring-less year\". As of 9 May, at least 90 people have died; 25 in India, and 65 more in Pakistan, with the final toll expected to be much higher.\nSeverity and significance.\nThe heat wave broke records for temperature highs in Pakistan and India. The wave has also received attention due to its length.\nImpacts.\nImpact on agriculture.\nDuring the 2022 food crises, India began taking steps to export more rice and wheat, in part to fill the gaps created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the heatwave caused increasing local prices and lower supply, issues also exacerbated by the war increasing fertilizer prices. The heat wave occurred mostly during the final weeks of the wheat growing season, killing the plants shortly before harvest.\nThe heatwave strongly impacted agriculture in India. At the same time early rainfall in India was 71% lower than the norm. In Punjab, the main crop producer in India, 15% of the harvest was lost and in some regions even 30%. \nThe heatwave caused a reverse in policy by Indian government, from trying to import to address the crises, to halting exports.\nThe heatwave has also severely impacted peach and apple harvests in Balochistan.\nNature and the environment.\nThe heatwave has resulted in birds falling from the sky in Gujarat.\nBridge collapse.\nThe Hassanabad Bridge in Hunza Valley, Pakistan collapsed after a glacial lake released large amounts of water into a stream caused by the heatwave.\nElectricity shortages.\nIndia faced its worst electricity shortage in more than six years, and demand due to the heat wave strained the electric grid in the country. Scorching temperatures forced early closures of schools and sent people indoors. Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh all reduced power allocated to industry due to an increase in power consumption dedicated to cooling.\nThe high power demand increased demand for coal in India, which is the main source of electricity generation in the country. The state-run enterprise Coal India increased its output by 27%. Indian Railways had to cancel hundreds of passenger trains as an emergency measure to prioritize hauling coal to coal power plants to avoid blackouts. The state also requested that electricity providers imported some 19 million tonnes of coal before the end of June.\nOn Friday, 29 April 2022, demand for electricity reached 207 gigawatts, an all-time high in India, representing an increase of two gigawatts of demand over the previous day.\nCauses.\nA real-time extreme event attribution study by the World Weather Attribution project shows the heat wave was rendered 30 times more likely and more intense due to climate change.\nExtreme event attribution study of a 2010 heatwave show that this heatwave is consistent with underlying climate change in Pakistan and in India, and Indian scientists say that the major local cause was \"weak western disturbances \u2013 storms originating in the Mediterranean region \u2013 which meant little pre-monsoon rainfall in north-western and central India\".", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}
{"id": "304821", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304821", "title": "2003 European heat wave", "text": "The 2003 European heat wave saw the hottest summer recorded in Europe since at least 1540. France was hit especially hard. The heat wave led to health crises in several countries and combined with drought to create a crop shortfall in parts of Southern Europe. The death toll has been estimated at more than 70,000.\nThe predominant heat was recorded in July and August, partly a result of the western European seasonal lag from the maritime influence of the Atlantic warm waters in combination with hot continental air and strong southerly winds.\nBy country.\nFrance.\nIn France, 14,802 heat-related deaths (mostly among the elderly) occurred during the heat wave, according to the French National Institute of Health. France does not commonly have very hot summers, particularly in the northern areas, but eight consecutive days with temperatures of more than were recorded in Auxerre, Yonne in early August 2003. Because of the usually relatively mild summers, most people did not know how to react to very high temperatures (for instance, with respect to rehydration). Most single-family homes and residential facilities were not equipped with central air conditioning. While contingency plans were made for a variety of natural and man-made catastrophes, high temperatures had rarely been considered a major hazard.\nThe catastrophe occurred in August, a month in which many people, including government ministers and physicians, are on holiday. Many bodies were not claimed for many weeks because relatives were on holiday. A refrigerated warehouse outside Paris was used by undertakers as they did not have enough space in their own facilities. On 3 September 2003, 57 bodies were still left unclaimed in the Paris area, and were buried.\nThe high number of deaths can be explained by the conjunction of seemingly unrelated events. Most nights in France are cool, even in summer. As a consequence, houses (usually of stone, concrete, or brick construction) do not warm too much during the daytime and radiate minimal heat at night, and air conditioning is usually unnecessary. During the heat wave, temperatures remained at record highs even at night, breaking the usual cooling cycle.\nElderly people living by themselves had never faced such extreme heat before and did not know how to react or were too mentally or physically impaired by the heat to make the necessary adaptations themselves. Elderly people with family support or those residing in nursing homes were more likely to have others who could make the adjustments for them. This led to unexpected survival rates with the weakest group having fewer deaths than the more physically fit; most of the heat victims came from the group of elderly not requiring constant medical care, or those living alone, without frequent contact with immediate family.\nThat shortcomings of the nation's health system could allow such a death toll is a controversy in France. The administration of President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin laid the blame on families who had left their elderly behind without caring for them, the 35-hour workweek, which affected the amount of time doctors could work, and family practitioners vacationing in August. Many companies traditionally closed in August, so people had no choice about when to vacation. Family doctors were still in the habit of vacationing at the same time. It is not clear that more physicians would have helped, as the main limitation was not the health system, but locating old people needing assistance.\nThe opposition, as well as many of the editorials of the French local press, blamed the administration. Many blamed Health Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mattei for failing to return from his vacation when the heat wave became serious, and his aides for blocking emergency measures in public hospitals (such as the recalling of physicians). A particularly vocal critic was Dr.\u00a0Patrick Pelloux, head of the union of emergency physicians, who blamed the Raffarin administration for ignoring warnings from health and emergency professionals and trying to minimize the crisis. Mattei lost his ministerial post in a cabinet reshuffle on 31 March 2004.\nNot everyone blamed the government. \"The French family structure is more dislocated than elsewhere in Europe, and prevailing social attitudes hold that once older people are closed behind their apartment doors or in nursing homes, they are someone else's problem\", said St\u00e9phane Mantion, an official with the French Red Cross. \"These thousands of elderly victims didn't die from a heat wave as such, but from the isolation and insufficient assistance they lived with day in and out, and which almost any crisis situation could render fatal.\"\nMoreover, the French episode of heat wave in 2003 shows how heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors. Although research established that heat waves represent a major threat for public health, France had no policy in place. Until the 2003 event, heat waves were a strongly underestimated risk in the French context, which partly explains the high number of victims.\nBelow are statistics for the month of August 2003 in France.\nThe 2003 heatwave served as a wake-up call for many cities to take action on reducing climate risks in urban areas. The following year, the country drew up the National Heat Wave Plan built on national forecasting and alert systems. Despite hotter summers since, the death toll has been significantly lowered. In addition to a major effort to issue warning messages in time, the plan includes measures such as cooling rooms at senior centers, replacing tarmac at playgrounds with more heat reflective materials, and mandatory insulation in construction regulation. This reflects a growing awareness of the benefit of an integrated response to risks like heatwaves, compared to stand-alone technologies and projects and greater attention paid to green and blue infrastructure in city planning. Since 2012, French construction standards for new buildings and, to a lesser extent for existing buildings, have included requirements regarding comfort during heatwaves. In Paris, adding parks and green spaces has been another key solution to heatwaves. Urban greening is most effective when green spaces are watered during a heatwave. Doing so increases the cooling effect from evapotranspiration.\nPortugal.\nIn Portugal, there were an estimated 1,953 excess deaths (data corrected, range 1,866 to 2,039); 43% higher than the expected number for that year. 1 August 2003 was the hottest day in centuries, with night temperatures well above . At dawn that same day, a freak storm developed in the southern region of the country. Over the next week, a hot, strong \"sirocco\" wind contributed to the spread of extensive forest-fires.\nFive percent of Portugal's countryside and 10% of the forests (215,000\u00a0hectares or an estimated ), were destroyed, and 18 people died in the flames. In Amareleja, one of the hottest cities in Europe, temperatures reached as high as .\nLuxembourg.\nIn Findel, Luxembourg, the temperature reached on 8 and 12 August, making it the country's highest temperature since records began in 1947.\nThis temperature record was later broken in July 2019.\nNetherlands.\nAbout 1,500 heat-related deaths occurred in the Netherlands, again largely the elderly. The heat wave broke no records, although four tropical weather-designated days in mid-July, preceding the official wave, are not counted due to a cool day in between and the nature of the Netherlands specification/definition of a heat wave.\nThe highest temperature recorded this heatwave was on 7 August, when in Arcen, in Limburg, a temperature of was reached, 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C below the national record (since 1904). A higher temperature had only been recorded twice before. On 8 August, a temperature of was recorded, and 12 August had a temperature of .\nSpain.\nInitially, 141 deaths were attributed to the heat wave in Spain. A further research of INE estimated a 12,963 excess of deaths during summer of 2003. Temperature records were broken in various cities, with the heat wave being more felt in typically cooler northern Spain.\nRecord temperatures were felt in:\nItaly.\nThe summer of 2003 was among the warmest in the preceding three centuries. The weather station of Catenanuova, in Sicily, had a monthly mean of in July 2003, with an absolute maximum of on 17 July, with monthly mean maximum temperatures of , and in June, July, and August, respectively.\nOn some days, the increase in power consumption, paired with a 800MW reduction of the electricity imported from France, itself coping with the heat wave, compelled the Italian power companies to set up rolling blackouts. Italy estimated that the number of heat wave related deaths was approximately 20,000.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, shipping could not navigate the Elbe or Danube, as a result of low water levels. Around 300 people \u2014 mostly elderly \u2014 died during the heatwave.\nSwitzerland.\nMelting glaciers in the Alps caused avalanches and flash floods in Switzerland. A new nationwide record temperature of was recorded in Grono, Graub\u00fcnden.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe United Kingdom experienced one of its hottest summers on record with temperatures well above average. Atlantic cyclones brought cool and wet weather for a short while at the end of July and beginning of August before the temperatures started to increase substantially on 3 August. Several weather records were broken in the United Kingdom, including a new record for the country's highest ever recorded temperature of at Faversham in Kent on 10 August, which remained the highest recorded temperature in the UK until the heatwave in July 2019.\nThis was the first occasion on which temperatures exceeding had ever been officially recorded in the UK. Scotland broke its highest temperature record with recorded in Greycrook in the Scottish borders on 9 August.\nDue to a number of deaths, the UK government released its Heat Health Watch system, issuing warnings if temperatures rise above 30\u00a0\u00b0C in the day and 15\u00a0\u00b0C at night. According to the BBC, over 2,000 more people than usual may have died in the United Kingdom during the 2003 heatwave.\nThe tarmac melted on part of the M25 between Junctions 26 and 27, and rails buckled from expansion on the hottest day in England in 13 years, while two teenaged boys drowned while trying to escape the excessive heat.\nIreland.\nThe summer of 2003 was warmer than average in Ireland, but the heat was far less pronounced there than in the rest of Europe. August was by far the warmest, sunniest, and driest month, with temperatures roughly 2\u00a0\u00b0C above average. The highest temperature recorded was at Belderrig, County Mayo on 8 August.\nAgricultural impact.\nCrops in Southern Europe suffered the most from drought.\nWheat.\nThese shortfalls in wheat harvest occurred as a result of the long drought.\nMany other countries had shortfalls of 5\u201310%, and the EU total production was down by 10\u00a0million tonnes, or 10%.\nGrapes.\nThe heatwave greatly accelerated the ripening of grapes; also, the heat dehydrated the grapes, making for more concentrated juice. By mid-August, the grapes in certain vineyards had already reached their optimal sugar content, possibly resulting in 12.0\u00b0\u201312.5\u00b0 wines (see alcoholic degree). Because of that, and also of the impending change to rainy weather, the harvest was started much earlier than usual (e.g. in mid-August for areas that are normally harvested in September).\nThe wines from 2003, although in scarce quantity, were predicted to have exceptional quality, especially in France. The heatwave made Hungary fare extremely well in the Vinalies 2003 International wine contest: a total of nine gold and nine silver medals were awarded to Hungarian winemakers.\nOceanic impact.\nThe anomalous overheating affecting the atmosphere also created anomalies on sea surface stratification in the Mediterranean Sea and on the surface currents, as well. A seasonal current of the central Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS), was affected by the warm temperatures, resulting in modifications in its path and intensity. The AIS is important for the reproduction biology of important pelagic commercial fish species, so the heatwave may have influenced indirectly the stocks of these species.\nEconomic impact.\nExtreme heat undermines the working capacity of individuals, resulting in lower productivity, and thus economic output. In 2003, economic losses attributed to excessive heat amounted to 0.5% of European Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nThis is 2.5 times higher than the losses experienced during an average year over the historical period 1981\u20132010. Losses of over 1% of GDP were recorded in areas with high exposure to heat and showing a large share of outdoor work.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

Most of the victims of the heat wave were elderly poor residents of the city, who did not have air conditioning, or had air conditioning but could not afford to turn it on, and did not open windows or sleep outside for fear of crime. The heat wave also heavily impacted the wider Midwestern region, with additional deaths in both St. Louis, Missouri and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nWeather.\nThe temperatures soared to record highs in July with the hottest weather occurring from July 12 to July 16. The high of on July 13 was the second warmest July temperature (warmest being set on July 23, 1934) since records began at Chicago Midway International Airport in 1928. Nighttime low temperatures were unusually high \u2014 in the upper 70s and lower 80s \u00b0F (about 26\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThe humidity made a large difference for the heat in this heat wave when compared to the majority of those of the 1930s, 1988, 1976\u201378 and 1954\u201356, which were powered by extremely hot, dry, bare soil and/or air masses which had originated in the desert Southwest. Each of the above-mentioned years' summers did have high-humidity heat waves as well, although 1988 was a possible exception in some areas. Moisture from previous rains and transpiration by plants drove up the humidity to record levels and the moist humid air mass originated over Iowa previous to and during the early stages of the heat wave. Numerous stations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and elsewhere reported record dew point temperatures above with a peak at with an air temperature of making for a heat index reported from at least one station in Wisconsin (Appleton) at 5:00 pm local time on the afternoon of 14 July 1995, a probable record for the Western Hemisphere; this added to the heat to cause heat indices above in Iowa and southern Wisconsin on several days of the heat wave as the sun bore down from a cloudless sky and evaporated even more water seven days in a row.\nA few days after, the heat moved to the east, with temperatures in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania reaching and in Danbury, Connecticut, which is Connecticut's highest recorded temperature. North of the border, Toronto, Ontario reached , when coupled with record high humidity from the same airmass resulted in its highest ever humidex value of 50.\nDewpoint records are not as widely kept as those of temperature, however, the dew points during the heat wave were at or near national and continental records.\nAnalysis.\nThe heat wave was caused by a large high pressure system that traversed across the midwest United States. This system was consistently producing maximum temperatures in the 90's (\u00b0F / 32-38 \u00b0C) during the day with minimum temperatures still remaining as high as the 80s (27-32 \u00b0C) at night, which is abnormal for midwest summer months. The system also brought extremely low wind speeds, along with high humidity. In the MERRA-2 and the ERAI meteorological reanalyses, the system (see figure) moved eastward, becoming indistinguishable by July 18.\nVictims.\nEric Klinenberg, author of the 2002 book \"Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago\", has noted that the map of heat-related deaths in Chicago mirrors the map of poverty. Most of the heat wave victims were the elderly poor living in the heart of the city, who either had no air conditioning, or had air conditioning but could not afford to turn it on. Many older citizens were also hesitant to open windows and doors at night for fear of crime. Elderly women, who may have been more socially engaged, were less vulnerable than elderly men. By contrast, during the heat waves of the 1930s, many residents slept outside in the parks or along the shore of Lake Michigan.\nBecause of the nature of the disaster, and the slow response of authorities to recognize it, no official \"death toll\" has been determined. However, figures show that 739 additional people died in that particular week above the usual weekly average. Further epidemiologic analysis showed that Black residents were more likely to die than White residents, and that Hispanic residents had an unusually low death rate due to heat. At the time, many Black residents lived in areas of sub-standard housing and less cohesive neighborhoods, while Hispanic residents at the time lived in places with higher population density, and more social cohesion.\nMortality displacement refers to the deaths that occur during a heat wave that would have occurred anyway in a near future, but which were precipitated by the heat wave itself. In other words, people who are already very ill and close to death (expected to die, for instance, within days or a few weeks) might die sooner than they might have otherwise, because of the impact of the heat wave on their health. However, because their deaths have been hastened by the heat wave, in the months that follow the number of deaths becomes lower than average. This is also called a \"harvesting effect\", in which part of the expected (future) mortality shifts forward a few weeks to the period of the heat wave. Initially some public officials suggested that the high death toll during the weeks of the heat wave was due to mortality displacement; an analysis of the data later found that mortality displacement during the heat wave was limited to about 26% of the estimated 692 excess deaths in the period between June 21 and August 10, 1995. Mortality risks affected Black residents disproportionally. Appropriately targeted interventions may have a tangible effect on life expectancy.\nIn August, the remains of forty-one victims whose bodies had not been claimed were buried in a mass grave in Homewood, Illinois.\nAggravating factors.\nImpacts in the Chicago urban center were exacerbated by an urban heat island that raised nocturnal temperatures by more than . Urban heat islands are caused by the concentration of buildings and pavement in urban areas, which tend to absorb more heat in the day and radiate more of that heat at night into their immediate surroundings than comparable rural sites. Therefore, built-up areas get hotter and stay hotter.\nOther aggravating factors were inadequate warnings, power failures, inadequate ambulance service and hospital facilities, and lack of preparation. City officials did not release a heat emergency warning until the last day of the heat wave. Thus, such emergency measures as Chicago's five cooling centers were not fully utilized. The medical system of Chicago was severely taxed as thousands were taken to local hospitals with heat-related problems.\nAnother powerful factor in the heat wave was that a temperature inversion grew over the city, and air stagnated in this situation. Pollutants and humidity were confined to ground level, and the air was becalmed and devoid of wind. Without wind to stir the air, temperatures grew even hotter than could be expected with just an urban heat island, and without wind there was truly no relief. Without any way to relieve the heat, even the insides of homes became ovens, with indoor temperature exceeding at night. This was especially noticeable in areas which experienced frequent power outages. At Northwestern University just north of Chicago, summer school students lived in dormitories without air conditioning. In order to ease the effects of the heat, some of the students slept at night with water-soaked towels as blankets.\nThe scale of the human tragedy sparked denial in some quarters, grief and blame elsewhere. From the moment the local medical examiner began to report heat-related mortality figures, political leaders, journalists, and in turn the Chicago public have actively denied the disaster's significance. Although so many city residents died that the coroner had to call in seven refrigerated trucks to store the bodies, skepticism about the trauma continues today. In Chicago, people still debate whether the medical examiner exaggerated the numbers and wonder if the crisis was a \"media event.\" \"The American Journal of Public Health\" established that the medical examiner's numbers actually undercounted the mortality by about 250 since hundreds of bodies were buried before they could be autopsied.\nEnvironmental racism.\nVarious aggravating factors in this context have informed discussions about environmental racism, environmental injustice within a racialized context.\nIn the context of the 1995 Chicago heat wave, principles of environmental racism have been used to better understand the hugely unequal death rates between various groups in the Chicago population. Out of the 739 heat related deaths attributed to the heat wave, it was found that Black citizens died at a much higher rate than their white peers. Further, this finding was statistically significant beyond the consideration of increased rate of death in impoverished areas.\nIn 2018, filmmaker Judith Hefland created \"Cooked: Survival by Zip Code\", a documentary exploring the unequal death rates observed during the 1995 heat wave. \"Cooked\" examines the factors that most directly contributed to these unequal death rates, and posits that such a crisis was not a one time catastrophe, but rather a dangerous trend occurring beyond Chicago.\nThis documentary examined the particularly devastating impact of various aggravating factors on Black communities. Most directly, the lack of adequate warning and failure to utilize pre-existing cooling centers disadvantaged impoverished groups, and caused particularly devastating effects in Chicago's poorest areas. Hefland warns that Chicago can serve as a model for the environmental racism present in many American cities.\nUrban heat islands still exist throughout the United States and beyond, and impoverished, minority groups still disproportionately occupy these at risk neighborhoods. With the number of climate disasters increasing five fold over the past 50 years, the risk to these groups increases as well, and social movements calling for environmental justice have grown in turn.\nStatistics.\nChicago's daily low and high temperatures in 1995:\nStatistics about the averaged July monthly average temperatures from 1960\u20132016 give us a mean of 74 degrees F and a standard deviation of 2.7.\nDuring the week of the heat wave, there were 11% more hospital admissions than average for comparison weeks and 35% more than expected among patients aged 65 years and older. The majority of this excess (59%) were treatments for dehydration, heat stroke, and heat exhaustion.\nWet-bulb temperatures.\nWet-bulb temperatures during the heat wave reached in some places.

It was among the most destructive and most lethal natural disasters in U.S. history, claiming at least 1,700 lives. Because of the massive drought, agricultural damage reached US$20\u00a0billion (equivalent to $\u00a0billion in dollars). It is among the billion-dollar weather disasters listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nCauses.\nThe heat wave began in June when a strong high pressure ridge began to build in the central and southern United States allowing temperatures to soar to almost every day from June to September. The high pressure system also acted as a cap on the atmosphere inhibiting the development of thunderstorm activity, leading to exceptionally severe drought conditions. The heat wave paused briefly when the decaying Hurricane Allen disrupted the prevailing weather pattern.\nEffects.\nThe drought and heat wave conditions led many Midwestern cities to experience record heat. In Kansas City, Missouri, the high temperature was below only twice and soared above the century mark () for 17\u00a0days straight; in Memphis, Tennessee, the temperature reached an all-time high of on July 13, 1980, part of a 15-day stretch of temperatures above that lasted from July 6 to 20. In Indianapolis, Indiana on July 15, the temperature reached for the first time since 1954.\nIn Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, high temperatures exceeded a total of 69 times, including a record 42 consecutive days from June 23 to August 3, of which 28 days were above 105, and five days above 110. The area saw 29\u00a0days in which the previous record high temperature was either broken or tied, including its all-time high when the temperature hit on three consecutive days (June 26 and 27 at DFW Airport and June 28 at Dallas Love Field).\nSome 43% of American homes were without air conditioning in 1980.\nHurricane Allen briefly paused the heat wave in early August. The 2011 North American heat wave would ultimately surpass the 1980 heat wave in terms of number of days with highs exceeding 100 (with 71 days) and the highest-ever low temperature for a single day (86 degrees); however, that heat wave only had 40 consecutive days of temperatures exceeding 100 (two short of the record) and the 113 degrees of 1980 remains a DFW all-time high. The high temperatures of the 1980 heat wave were worse than 2011, as was its early start in June and its ultimate human toll.\nOn the northern rim of the high pressure ridge, several severe long-lived windstorms called derechos formed. The most notable was the \"More Trees Down Derecho\" that occurred on July 5. It raced from eastern Nebraska to Virginia in 15\u00a0hours, killing six and injuring about 70. The Western Wisconsin Derecho of July 15 killed three, and caused extensive property damage.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

It resulted in record-breaking temperatures for the month of June at many locations. France experienced temperatures in excess of for the first time in recorded history. A national all-time record high temperature of occurred on 28 June in V\u00e9rargues.\nIn late July, a second heat wave occurred, during which all-time records were broken by in Belgium, by in Germany and the Netherlands, by in Luxembourg, and by in the United Kingdom. The deaths of 868 people in France and one person in Belgium were reported, along with thousands of animals when ventilation systems in barns were overwhelmed. Due to high river water temperatures and sluggish flows, particularly in France and to some extent Germany, a number of thermal power stations that use once-through cooling and do not have cooling towers had to reduce output or shut down to avoid breaching environmental limits on river water temperature designed to protect aquatic life.\nMeteorological history.\nThe above-normal hot condition in June is caused by an anomalous long-lasting anticyclone in the upper troposphere, which advects warm air from the Sahel and Mediterranean region and enhances incoming solar radiation and surface turbulent fluxes. The anomalous anticyclone results from an unusually-intensified British-Baikal Corridor pattern and a synoptic Rossby wave breaking event over Europe.\nThe July heat wave was caused by a strong omega block, consisting of hot, dry air from North Africa, trapped between cold storm systems. The high-pressure area of hot air, called Yvonne, stretched from the central Mediterranean to Scandinavia and was pinned between two low-pressure areas, one over western Russia and the other over the eastern Atlantic.\nFatalities.\nTotal excess deaths are estimated to be around 2,500 during the summer months in 2019. Most of these were indirectly caused and were observed in statistical modeling later that year. Based on individual country counts, that figure may be an under estimate. The Dutch government reported 400 excess deaths in the week of the June heat wave, a figure comparable to those recorded during the 2006 European heat wave.\nFrance estimated 1,435 additional deaths due to the heatwave. Public Health England reported 900 excess deaths from the heatwave. The Robert Koch institute reported 500 excess deaths in Berlin alone.\nBelgium reported at least 716 excess deaths during the summer.\nBy country.\nBelgium.\nBelgium recorded three consecutive days exceeding ; 25 June was the hottest day during this period, with many places exceeding and other places nearly reaching .\nDuring the period of hot weather, environmental officials warned of poor air quality levels, which would especially affect the young, elderly and people with respiratory illnesses. It also affects small countries that rely on tourism as their main source of income.\nOn 24 July, the highest ever recorded temperature in Belgium was measured, reaching in the town of Angleur, exceeding the previous record of , reached in 1947. On the same day, passengers were evacuated from a Eurostar train that had broken down between Halle and Tubize, as many began to fall ill due to the extreme temperatures. On 25 July, the national record was broken again, reaching in Begijnendijk (Flemish Brabant). One death was reported.\nThe official KMI weather station in Uccle reported a maximum temperature of , while many other weather stations, some even close to the North Sea, reported temperatures in excess of .\nCzech Republic.\nThe temperature record for June was recorded in Doksany and was . High temperatures also complicated rail transport in the Czech Republic.\nDenmark.\nOn 22 July 2019 the DMI issued a warning for high temperatures possibly up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F). \nOn 24 July, the temperature reached 30.9\u00a0\u00b0C (87.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in \u00c5benr\u00e5, Svendborg and Nyk\u00f8bing Falster. \nOn 25 July the temperature reached 32.0\u00a0\u00b0C (89.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in Vordingborg &amp; Holb\u00e6k. \nTemperatures for that day were forecasted up to 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), but due to afternoon thunderstorms the temperature only reached a maximum of 32.0\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F).\nFinland.\nOn 28 July, Helsinki recorded a temperature of , breaking the city's previous record. On the same day, was recorded in Porvoo.\nFrance.\nFrance was one of the most affected countries from the heatwave, with much of the country exceeding on 26 June. M\u00e9t\u00e9o France issued an Orange Alert for much of the country due to exceptionally hot temperatures, excluding coastal regions, e.g. Brittany and the northern part of Hauts-de-France. Four departments of France were put on Red Alert: Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Gard, H\u00e9rault and Vaucluse. Owing to building codes with old structures common across the country, numerous buildings in France lack air conditioning.\nThe French Government acted more proactively for the heat wave in light of its failings during the 2003 European heat wave. 15,000\u00a0people died during that event in France. Approximately 4,000\u00a0schools closed nationwide. Authorities in Paris opened public cooling rooms. Parks and pools extended operation hours in multiple cities. Museums with air conditioning allowed free entry for all people.\nFrance observed temperatures in excess of for the first time in recorded history. A national all-time record of\n was recorded by a manned weather station in V\u00e9rargues on 28 June, verified by M\u00e9t\u00e9o France on 19 July. Earlier, the highest temperature considered to have been reliably recorded during the heat wave was by an automatic weather station in Gallargues-le-Montueux, also on 28 June. These exceeded the previous record of , recorded in Conqueyrac and Saint-Christol-l\u00e8s-Al\u00e8s.\nTwelve other locations observed temperatures above the previous record high. Villevieille experienced temperatures of on this day. Numerous records were broken along the Mediterranean coastline. Montpellier observed a temperature of , shattering the previous all-time by . Nantes and Bourges saw their highest low-temperature ever during the overnight of 27\u201328 June at and , respectively.\nFive people died nationwide: four from drowning and one from heat stroke. Police noted an increase in instances of illegal fire hydrant openings. A six-year-old child was hospitalised in critical condition after being hit by a stream of water from an illegally opened hydrant. Hospitals reported a significant increase in cases of cramps, dehydration, dizziness, and heart conditions.\nIn July 2019, France experienced its second heat wave in less than a month, beating several regional and national temperature records. In the previous month, a national record temperature of was measured in the southern commune of Gallargues-le-Montueux. More than 50 French cities exceeded their previous high temperature records in this heat wave.\nOn 23 July 80 departments of France were included in an orange heat wave alert by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, and 20 departments were included in a red alert the next day. On 24 July, a temperature of was registered by M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France in Bordeaux, breaking the city's previous record of in 2003. Similarly, on 25 July, a temperature of was recorded in Paris, also breaking the city's previous record of in July 1947.\nOn the night of 24\u201325 July, France saw its hottest night since records began, as the whole country averaged an overnight low of , exceeding the record from the 2003 heat wave. Bordeaux saw an overnight low of , beating the previous record of 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F, 2006); Lille saw , exceeding the July 2007 record of . Lille also saw a high of the following day, above the record of that had been set the previous year.\nOn 25 July, the chief architect of the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral told media that he feared that the heat wave could cause the cathedral's vaulted ceilings, damaged in an April 2019 fire, to collapse. While he indicated the stone walls were still stable for the time being, he explained that the walls were still saturated with water sprayed by firefighters during the blaze, and rapid drying from the extreme temperatures could adversely affect the stability of the structure.\nTwo nuclear reactors in southwest France were shut down and the output of six reactors were curtailed to avoid breaching environmental limits on the temperature of the rivers they use for cooling water. This reduced French nuclear power generation by around 5.2 gigawatts at a time of increased electricity demand due to the use of cooling devices.\nAccording to the French Ministry of Health, 567 were reported to have died during the June heat wave, and 868 people died as a result of the July heat wave.\nGermany.\nMost of Germany recorded temperatures exceeding on 26 June as well as large parts of the country exceeding . Temperatures as high as were recorded in Berlin-Tempelhof, and Brandenburg had temperatures reaching , exceeding the previous June record of recorded in Frankfurt. Nationwide, the average temperature for all of June reached , marking the warmest June in 140\u00a0years of record-keeping.\nFour people died from drowning nationwide.\nOn 25 July, a temperature of was recorded in Lingen, Lower Saxony. This beat the record for the highest ever temperature recorded in Germany, following its previous record of measured a day earlier. Twenty-five weather stations in the country reported temperatures of or higher on 25 July. Prior to this heat wave, the highest recorded temperature in Germany was in Kitzingen in 2015.\nAt the end of the heat wave, on the evening of 26 July, a maximum purple alert for storms was issued for three districts (\"Landkreise\") of the Land Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, namely Freudenstadt, B\u00f6blingen and Calw.\nGreenland.\nAfter the heat wave ended in mainland Europe, the mass of warm air traveled north to Greenland, causing a heat wave that led to a melting of some of ice in July. The melting was forecast to peak on 1 August. For comparison, the entire melt season in 2012 caused of ice loss. A record 56.5 percent of Greenland Ice Sheet was showing signs of melting on 31 July. US National Snow and Ice Data Center estimated ice loss during the first week of August at per day with a total loss of for the melt season to date.\nA wild fire which has been burning near Sisimiut since early July necessitated dispatching firefighters from Denmark, as the fire was endangering inhabited areas and had the potential to continue burning through the winter. Forest fires are exceedingly rare in Greenland.\nItaly.\nBy 28 June, Italian authorities placed 16\u00a0cities under high alert for dangerous temperatures. Civil security services distributed water to tourists visiting Rome.\nA 72-year-old man died of heat stroke in the Milano Centrale railway station.\nLuxembourg.\nOn 25 July, a red alert for extreme heat was put in place for the entire country by Meteolux. The same day, a temperature of was measured in Steinsel, the highest ever recorded in the country, beating the record of set in Remich in 2003.\nThe high heat and dry conditions caused several fires during the heat wave. On 24 July, a fire broke out near Schumannseck, and hay bales caught fire in a field. On 25 July, a bush fire occurred in Hamm, and a fire truck exploded when it became engulfed in flames whilst attending the scene.\nNetherlands.\nOn 25 June, much of the inland areas of the Netherlands exceeded . The KNMI issued a code yellow warning for large parts of the country due to the heat, and RIVM also put National Heat Plans into force in areas issued under code yellow.\nDe Bilt, where the headquarters of the KNMI is located, recorded a temperature of , and parts of Uden and Gelderland recorded temperatures as high as .\nIn July in the Netherlands, an orange alert was put in place for the entire country due to the extreme heat. The previous high temperature heat record , set in Warnsveld in 1944, was broken on 24 July in Eindhoven (North Brabant) where the temperature reached . The following day, was measured in Gilze-Rijen (also North Brabant). The West Frisian Islands was the only region for which no weather alert had been issued but there was a heatwave for the first time ever on Vlieland and Terschelling since measurements started in 1996.\nOn 27 July, the KNMI ended the orange alert for South Holland, Zeeland, North Brabant and Limburg. The same day at 22:32 CEST they ended the orange alert for the whole country.\nOn 22 July, ProRail announced code red for traffic controllers, as extra alertness was necessary for disturbances on the tracks and other problems due to heat. On 25 July, NS cancelled services on the Schiphol\u2013Antwerp high-speed railway between Amsterdam\u2014Schiphol\u2014Rotterdam, and the connection between Amsterdam\u2014Eindhoven and Eindhoven\u2014Heerlen. As trains were exposed to high temperatures, more maintenance was required and some were taken out of service. Units without air conditioning or openable windows were also taken out of service. This continued into the following day, except with four other routes made unavailable; Amsterdam\u2014Alkmaar, Amsterdam\u2014The Hague, Duivendrecht\u2014Lelystad and Schiphol\u2014Nijmegen.\nMany farm animals died as a result of the high temperatures, mainly due to ventilation systems failing. Due to a power failure in a chicken barn in Neer, 4,000 chickens died. Hundreds of chickens also died whilst being transported to Poland on 24 July because of rising temperatures. On the same day, hundreds of pigs died in Middelharnis because of power failure in ventilation systems, and 2,100 pigs died in Maarheeze as barns reached temperatures of .\nNearly 400 extra people were reported to have died during the heatwave compared to a regular summer week.\nNorway.\nOn 26 July, a temperature of was recorded in Bergen in Norway, setting a new temperature record for the city. A day later, at Laksfors railway station south of Mosj\u00f8en, a temperature of was recorded, equalling the national all-time temperature record first set in June 1970. However, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute later did not approve the recording due to too much gravel and too high vegetation near the station.\nThe highest recording approved was at the Mosj\u00f8en Airport on 27 July, the warmest temperature ever recorded in Northern Norway and a tie with the all-time national high for July. The same day, a temperature of was recorded further north in Saltdal. This is highest temperature ever recorded inside the Arctic Circle in Norway. On 27 July, Trondheim Airport recorded a new all-time high with and saw five consecutive days with high above .\nAt S\u00f8mna-Kval\u00f8yfjellet, a weather station on a coastal hill ASL in Nordland in Northern Norway (), the overnight low on 28 July did not go below , beating the previous national record for the warmest night of recorded 6 degrees of latitude further south in Halden, south of Oslo, in July 1933.\nThe Norwegian Meteorological Institute said that it had recorded \"tropical nights\" in 20 locations in the south of the country, where temperatures stayed above throughout the night.\nPoland.\nPoland recorded high temperatures early in June, with much of the country exceeding on 12 June. Like much of Western and Central Europe, most of Poland recorded temperatures as high as on 26 June. Poland has also exceeded its previous June record, recording in Radzy\u0144.\nSpain.\nLarge parts of Spain recorded temperatures exceeding recorded on 27 June, and recorded its hottest temperatures in the north east of the country, with temperatures reaching as high as in Bilbao and exceeding in Zaragoza on 27 June. Albuquerque, Badajoz recorded on 29 June.\nZaragoza Airport registered in June 2019, Zaragoza was forecasted to reach temperatures as high as , exceeding the June temperature record for the city.\nAt least two heat stroke deaths occurred in the country: a 93-year-old man in Valladolid and a 17-year-old boy in C\u00f3rdoba.\nA wildfire broke out in La Torre de l'Espanyol within the Province of Tarragona in Catalonia on 26 June. According to local authorities, the fire ignited from decomposing chicken feces exposed to prolonged sunlight. Strong winds caused the fire to expand, with the blaze covering by 28 June. It was said to be the worst wildfire in Catalonia in 20 years.\nBy 28 June more than 600\u00a0firefighters and six aircraft were deployed to combat the blaze. Dozens of people were displaced, including at least 30 in Flix. Near the village, more than 200\u00a0sheep, 2\u00a0horses, and a donkey \ndied in the fire. One of Asc\u00f3's Nuclear Power Plant evacuation power lines was near the site the fire started, so it was subsequently switched off in an attempt to aid with the fire extinguishing tasks. The plant continued to operate normally throughout the days.\nSweden.\nSweden was only affected in the southern portion of the country. On 30 June Oskarshamn measured the highest June temperature since 1970.\nOn 26 July, a temperature of was recorded in , the highest temperature recorded in the north of Sweden since 1945. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute issued a Class 1 heat warning for parts of the country, as well as a warning for potential water shortages in August in 15 counties. To prevent forest fires due to the heat and dry weather, fire bans were put in place in several locations in Sweden. A meteorologist at the institute stated that although above average, temperatures in the south of the country were not as extreme. Mainly, the reason for this was that July started with a cool spell in Northern Europe in between the two heat waves.\nSwitzerland.\nIn Switzerland, heat records were broken for the month of June at nearly 30 locations across the country. Temperatures reached as high as in Z\u00fcrich and in Basel on 26 June.\nAreas with high altitudes also exceeded , with temperatures reaching as high as in Col Des Mosses and Adelboden.\nMeteoSwiss issued a Level 3 hazard due to high temperatures for much of the country, with large parts of Valais and Ticino under a Level 4 hazard, meaning high danger due to the exceptional heat.\nUnited Kingdom.\nOn 29 June large parts of England, including the South and the Midlands, faced temperatures exceeding with the highest temperature of recorded at Heathrow Airport and RAF Northolt. The heatwave was rather short lived in the United Kingdom, with temperatures dropping to near normal the next day.\nOne child drowned in the River Irwell in Greater Manchester after diving in to cool off during high temperatures.\nOn 23 July, Public Health England renewed a heat warning for the whole of the United Kingdom, urging people to \"keep hydrated, find shade and take protection against the sun\". On the same night, widespread thunderstorms affected the country, with BBC Weather reporting around 48,000 lightning strikes overnight.\nOn 25 July, the Met Office announced that the United Kingdom had its hottest July day on record, with a temperature of recorded in Rainham Kent. This beat the previous July record of in 2015, and marked the second time in history that the UK had recorded a temperature higher than . On 29 July, sensors at the Cambridge University Botanic Garden recorded a temperature of on 25 July, breaking the national all-time record of set in Brogdale, Kent, on 10 August 2003. Brogdale broke the highest temperature recorded in SE England for July with , 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C off its previous record in 2003.\nNew local temperature records were set in towns and cities across the country on 25 July, including in Edinburgh and in Sheffield.\nImpact on British transport and flights.\nOn 25 July, Network Rail began to impose speed restrictions across its network to reduce buckling rails, as track temperatures surpassed . Measures included painting railway tracks white to reduce the temperature of the steel, and cancelling services. East Midlands Trains, Southeastern and Greater Anglia advised passengers against all but essential travel.\nMany heat-related incidents on the country's rail network caused widespread disruptions, especially affecting intercity services from London. Damage to overhead line equipment occurred in Peterborough, Handsworth and Camden, as well as a trackside grass fire caused by cables snapping near West Hampstead. Trains arriving and departing from Birmingham New Street and around the West Midlands were also disrupted. Passengers were advised not to start new journeys as the overheating of overhead cables rendered many services unable to run.\nOn 26 July, all but essential travel had been advised against, after the extreme heat and storms caused severe disruption to the rail network and airports. Thameslink ran reduced services, with half of its lines unavailable. East Midlands Trains services between Sheffield, Nottingham, Derby and London St Pancras were disrupted due to overhead wire damage from the heat of the previous day, and an emergency timetable was put in place. All Eurostar services to and from Paris were suspended for an \"undetermined amount of time\" due to an exploded cable, as well as delays lasting up to an hour on Brussels services.\nSeveral flights were cancelled and delayed from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports due to \"extreme weather conditions across Europe\". A spokesperson from Heathrow said that flights had been affected by overnight storms as a result of the heat.\nHighest temperature per country.\n\u2022 : on 25 July in Begijnendijk.\n\u2022 : on 25 July in Vordingborg and Holb\u00e6k.\n\u2022 : on 28 July in Porvoo.\n\u2022 : on 28 June in V\u00e9rargues.\n\u2022 : on 25 July in Lingen.\n\u2022 : on 25 July in Steinsel.\n on 25 July in Gilze-Rijen.\n on 27 July in Saltdal.\n on 26 July in Radzy\u0144.\n on 29 June in Badajoz.\n on 26 July in Markusvinsa.\n on 26 June in Z\u00fcrich.\n on 25 July at Cambridge University Botanic Garden.\nResearch.\nAs of 1 August, the World Meteorological Organisation considered July 2019 to be at least tied for the hottest month ever recorded, based on global average temperature. Previously, June 2019 was found to be the hottest June on record. This was confirmed on 5 August by EU Earth Observation Network, which found it hotter than the previous record-holder, July 2016. 2019 on the whole was found to be on track for the new hottest year on record.\nA study of the event, a collaboration between several European climatological organisations and institutes, was published on 2 August 2019. It found that the temperatures experienced during the heat wave would have been lower had it not been for anthropogenic global warming, and that temperatures recorded in France and Netherlands would have occurred there on average less than once a millennium. According to the study's lead author, at the current pace of warming, such heatwaves will be another stronger by 2050.", "matches": ["heat wave", "heat waves"], "label": []}

It was one of the hottest and longest heat waves in the subcontinent since the two countries began recording weather reports. The highest temperatures occurred in Churu, Rajasthan, reaching up to , a near record high in India, missing the record of set in 2016 by a fraction of a degree. 32 days are classified as parts of the heatwave, making it the second longest ever recorded.\nAs a result of hot temperatures and inadequate preparation, more than 184 people died in the state of Bihar, with many more deaths reported in other parts of the country. In Pakistan, five infants died after extreme heat exposure.\nThe heat wave coincided with extreme droughts and water shortages across India and Pakistan. In mid-June, reservoirs that previously supplied Chennai ran dry, depriving millions. The water crisis was exacerbated by high temperatures and lack of preparation, causing protests and fights that sometimes led to killing and stabbing.\nBackground.\nHeat waves worldwide have become more extreme and more frequent due to human-influenced climate change and global warming. Since 2004, India and Pakistan have experienced 11 of its 15 warmest recorded years. The frequency and duration of heat waves in India and Pakistan has increased. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology has identified several contributing factors, including \"El Ni\u00f1o Modoki\", an irregular El Ni\u00f1o in which the central Pacific Ocean is warmer than the eastern part, and the loss of tree cover, which reduces shade, increasing temperatures, and reduces moisture in soil, which results in less evapotranspiration and more heat transfer into the atmosphere.\nIn response to the growing number of deaths from heat waves, the Indian government, although not addressing the root causes, began implementing measures intended to save lives in 2013. In Ahmedabad, for example, \"school days were reduced, government work programs ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas.\" Public gardens were opened during the daytime so that people could seek shade. Professor of public health Parthasarathi Ganguly estimated that 800 fewer people died in 2014 as a result of these policies.\nIn India, the rainy monsoon season typically begins on 1 June. However, in 2019, the season was delayed by seven days and began on 8 June. When it did occur, the monsoon made slow progress and only brought rains to 10\u201315% of the country by 19 June. Normally, two-thirds of the country would have received monsoon rains by this time. The lack of rainfall has intensified heat wave conditions and increased water scarcity.\nImpact.\nThe heat wave has caused multiple deaths and cases of illness. As of 31 May 2019, 8 deaths and 456 cases of illness due to heat were reported in Maharashtra, at least 17 deaths in Telangana, and 3 deaths and 433 cases of heat stroke in Andhra Pradesh. On 10 June 2019, three passengers were found dead on a train as it arrived in Jhansi, apparently due to the extreme heat. A fourth passenger was found in critical condition and brought to a hospital where they died of overheating. In the state of Bihar, heat-related deaths reached 184 on 18 June according to Al Jazeera, while according to Zee News the death toll was 139 on 19 June 2019.\nHigh temperatures have broken or nearly broken records in various cities across India and Pakistan. At one point, 11 of the 15 warmest places in the world were all located in the country. On 2 June 2019, the city of Churu recorded a temperature of , only one-fifth of a degree Celsius short of the country's highest-ever temperature, during the 2016 heat wave. On 9 June 2019, Allahabad reached , breaking its previous all-time record. On 3 and 4 June 2019, the temperature in Jacobabad reached making Pakistan's highest-ever temperature. On 10 June 2019, the temperature in Delhi reached , a new record high for the city in the month of June. On the same day, peak power usage in Delhi reached 6,686 MW, breaking all previous records. On 29 June 2019, the temperature in Islamabad and Rawalpindi reached .\nThe total number of deaths is unknown. For comparison, the 2003 European heat wave killed an estimated 35,000\u201370,000 people, with temperatures slightly less than in India and Pakistan. In human temperature physiology, core temperatures of are said to be a fever of type \"hyperpyrexia\", and considered a medical emergency as temperature may lead to problems including permanent brain damage, or death.\nWater shortages.\nDroughts and water shortages have occurred in multiple states across India and Pakistan, worsening heat wave conditions. In Chennai, millions of people are without consistent access to water. A lack of rainwater and groundwater has left four of the reservoirs that supply the city completely dry. The inability to meet demand for water has forced businesses like hotels and restaurants to close. Water tankers from areas of Tamil Nadu unaffected by drought have been bringing water into some areas of the city. However, government tankers can take up to a month to appear after requested, so some wealthy residents and business owners have opted to pay for costly private water tankers. The poor who live in slums do not have this option; a family in Chennai's slums may receive as little as of water every day compared to an average American household which uses of water a day. In Coimbatore, at least 550 people were arrested for protesting the city's government for mismanaging the water crisis.\nConflicts over access to water have also occurred throughout India. On 7 June, six people were stabbed in Jharkhand during a fight near a water tanker, and one man was killed in a similar fight in Tamil Nadu. In Madhya Pradesh on 5 June, a fight over water led to two men being \"seriously injured\", while in a separate fight a day earlier, a water tanker driver was \"beaten up\". In early June, fifteen monkeys were found dead in a forest in Madhya Pradesh, possibly as a result of the heat wave. Veterinarian Arun Mishra says this may have happened due to a conflict over water with a larger group of 30\u201335 monkeys. Mishra said this was \"rare and strange\" because herbivores do not usually engage in such conflicts.\nBihar encephalitis outbreak.\nThe heat wave is a possible aggravating factor in an encephalitis outbreak in Bihar which has killed over 100 children since 1 June.\nResponses.\nThe Indian National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had a goal for keeping heat related deaths this year to single digits. In 2018, the heat wave death toll was kept at 20 through public safety measures; for example, government workers across the country conducted awareness campaigns and distributed free water. However in 2019, the national general election took place and workers who normally issued heat wave warnings were instead performing election duties.\nIn early June, the Indian Meteorological Department issued a severe heat wave warning in Rajasthan and nearby areas such as Delhi. The Ministry of Health advised avoiding the sun between noon and 3 p.m. and not drinking alcohol, tea, or coffee. Meanwhile the NDMA recommended covering the head, cross-ventilating rooms, and sleeping under a slightly wet sheet.\nAsphalt used for roads expectantly begins to melt at ; therefore, on 3 June, the government of Churu poured water onto roads in order to cool them and prevent them from melting.\nIn response to fights over water in Madhya Pradesh, the police were deployed to guard water tankers and other sources of water from rioters, beginning 8 June.\nOn 17 June, the government of Gaya, a city in Bihar, imposed Section 144 to be active, which empowers an executive magistrate to prohibit an assembly of more than four persons in an area, and banned construction work and assemblies between 11 a.m. and 4\u00a0p.m.\nThe Pakistan Medical Association urged people to learn about the measures to avoid heat-related deaths.\nReferences.\n ", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The heat wave is considered one of the, if not the, most extreme in the region's history. During the heat wave, fifty separate locations set various records for consecutive, highest daytime and overnight temperatures. The highest temperature recorded during the heat wave was in Hopetoun, Victoria, a record for the state. Many locations through the region recorded all-time high temperatures including capital cities Adelaide, which reached its third-highest temperature, , and Melbourne, which recorded its highest-ever temperature on record, . Both cities broke records for the most consecutive days over , while Mildura, Victoria recorded an all-time record twelve consecutive days over .\nThe exceptional heat wave was caused by a slow-moving high-pressure system that settled over the Tasman Sea, with a combination of an intense tropical low located off the North West Australian coast and a monsoon trough over Northern Australia, which produced ideal conditions for hot tropical air to be directed down over southeastern Australia. The heat began in South Australia on 25 January but became more widespread over southeast Australia by 27 January. A weak cool change moved over the southern coastal areas bringing some relief on 30 January, including Melbourne, where the change arrived that evening, dropping temperatures to an average of . Higher temperatures returned on the following weekend with Melbourne recording its hottest day since records began in 1855, .\nThe heat wave generated extreme fire conditions during the peak of the 2008\u201309 Australian bushfire season, causing many bushfires in the affected region, contributing to the extreme bushfire conditions on 7 February, also known as the Black Saturday bushfires, which claimed 173 lives in Victoria.\nCause.\nThe heat wave was caused by a slow-moving high-pressure system that settled over the Tasman Sea. Coupled with an intense tropical low and a monsoon trough over Northern Australia, this produced hot, tropical air to be directed over southeastern Australia, raising temperatures significantly. The CSIRO stated that \"The warm lower tropospheric anticyclone is the key synoptic weather system responsible for the heat-waves.\" The heat wave was the worst in Australia's history.\nRecords and statistics.\nDuring the heat wave, several records were broken; Tasmania recorded its highest-ever temperature; in Scamander, and the long-standing Tasmanian record of (recorded in Hobart on 4 January 1976) was broken five times within two days at Flinders Island, Fingal (twice), St Helens and Scamander, while Hopetoun in Victoria recorded the state's highest temperature and the highest temperature of the heat wave, with a reading of .\nTemperatures (Daily Maximum).\nAvalon, Victoria.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nCeduna, South Australia.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nMildura, Victoria.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nDeniliquin, New South Wales.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nSwan Hill, Victoria.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nMelbourne, Victoria.\nTemperatures have been recorded since in 1855.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nAdelaide, South Australia.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nA record-high minimum temperature was recorded at around midnight on 29 January, when the temperature dropped to only at the Bureau of Meteorology weather station in Kent Town, near the Adelaide city centre. Temperatures recorded in other parts of the city and other towns throughout South Australia were even higher.\nWoomera, South Australia.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nWagga Wagga, New South Wales.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nOn 31 January 2009 Wagga Wagga broke the all-time January record for the most days above with six days recorded (the record previously being five days, which was set in 1952 and equalled in 1979 and 2001). The January record set in 1979 was equalled for number of days above or more which is 19 days.\nWagga Wagga broke the all-time record and the February record for the highest recorded maximum on 7 February 2009, 2:50pm AEDT the city recorded with the previous February record being set on 1 February 1968 and the all time previously being set on 23 January 2001.\nOn 8 February 2009 the record for the consecutive days over was to be broken with thirteen consecutive days recorded (the previous record being six days, which was set in 1946 and equalled in 1979, 1980 and 2004). Wagga Wagga also recorded fourteen consecutive days of over .\nAlbury\u2013Wodonga, NSW/VIC.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nBallarat, Victoria.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nCanberra, ACT.\nJanuary 2009\nFebruary\nLaunceston, Tasmania.\nJanuary 2009\nAccompanying bushfires.\nAfter a slow start to the 2008\u201309 Australian bushfire season, the high temperatures and wind precipitated several bushfires across Victoria and South Australia. The conditions were very similar to the heat wave experienced in early January 1939, which killed 438 people and precipitated the \"Black Friday\" bushfires of 1939.\nFires were also started in the Australian Alps by lightning strikes from dry thunderstorms in north-east Victoria and south-east New South Wales.\nThe tail end of the heat wave also precipitated the Black Saturday bushfires, in which 173 people died, 414 injured and 2,029 houses destroyed at various locations across the state. Several locations around the state recorded their highest temperatures since records began in 1859 and winds gusted up to 110\u00a0km/h.\nComparison to normal climate for the area.\nMany areas in central South Australia, northern Victoria and inland New South Wales regularly experience temperatures over for one, two or three consecutive days, sometimes more, during the summer months. During the heat wave, however, many of these regions experienced temperatures over for twice as long or more, on average, than is normal for that time of year. Coastal regions and the ACT experienced slightly lower temperatures; however, these were still above average and lasted for a prolonged period.\nWhile coastal regions may have experienced shorter periods of heat wave, for the time that they did experience temperatures over , they mostly reached the top 3, top 5 or top 10 all-time temperature records for a number of days. An excellent example of this is Melbourne, which had only 3 consecutive days over , yet when combined with the record set on 7 February, now has recorded three of its five (being 1st, 3rd and 5th) all-time record-high temperatures.\nThe heat wave was perhaps most extreme in northern and eastern Tasmania, where 7 of the 8 highest temperatures recorded in Tasmania up to that time occurred during the heat wave.\nA chart of the variation of maximum and minimum daily temperatures, through the year, for Melbourne&lt;ref name=\"Melbourne long-term average max/min temperatures\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was prepared from observations between May 1855 and August 2006. For early February, this shows a mean daily maximum temperature of with the 75th-percentile temperature being about .\nEffects.\nEnergy.\nLocalised power outages occurred throughout both cities during the week at varying times for various lengths. It is estimated that over 500,000 residents in Melbourne were without power for the evening of 30 January 2009. The outage affected much of central Melbourne with train and tram services cancelled, the evacuation of Crown Casino, traffic light failures, people being rescued from lifts and patrons of the Victorian Arts Centre evacuated and shows cancelled. The outage occurred only an hour after the National Electricity Market Management Company (NEMMCO) issued a statement saying load shedding was ending and power had been restored.\nBlackouts also occurred in the city's west, caused by the three-day heat wave. It is believed an explosion at South Morang contributed to the power problems along three transmission lines supplying Victoria's west and Victorian power supplier SP AusNet shed 1,000 megawatts. On the 30th, Energy Minister Peter Batchelor announced consumers who lose power for more than 20 hours would be eligible for compensation.\nAreas that didn't experience blackouts still had problems with abnormally low voltage (probably due to increased air-conditioner usage).\nAs of 1 February, the heat wave is estimated to have cost the Victorian economy $100m during the week.\nTransport.\nOver the course of the week, thousands of train and tram services were cancelled in both cities, with more than 1,300 individual train services cancelled in metropolitan Melbourne alone. The cancellations were due to buckling rail lines, air conditioner failures and power outages. On the 30th, all public transport in the city was free as the government admitted responsibility for failing to provide adequate infrastructure elements to cope with the heat, as well as long-standing issues with underfunding. On the 30th, 730 (40%) of rail services were cancelled, the worst day of operation since Connex took control in 2004.\n2009 Australian Open.\nSeveral outdoor matches during the 2009 Australian Open on the 29th and the 30th were cancelled due to the heat. A number of players, including number 3 seed Novak Djokovic, cited the temperature as reason for withdrawing from matches. Serena Williams was quoted as saying it was so hot on court she felt like she was having an \"out-of-body experience\". After these retirements and an intensification in the heat, the organisers responded by closing the roof and allowing players longer breaks and icepacks.\nHuman health.\nThere is dispute between sources as to how many people were affected by the heat wave. Hundreds were treated for heat-related illness and 6 fatalities were confirmed, and a number of \"sudden deaths\" were suspected to be caused by the heat. Authorities worked through each case to determine exactly how many fatalities were directly attributable to the heat wave.\nCommercial news sources vary widely at the number of fatalities, some report only 2 deaths, while others speculate that the toll may ultimately be higher. Fifty-seven deaths were suspected to have occurred in South Australia and 33 in Victoria, however authorities preferred to wait for coronial reports before confirming how many were directly attributable to the heat wave.\nThe Victorian state coroner announced a tripling of dead bodies being placed in the state mortuary during the heat wave, filling the morgue to capacity. Hospitals and funeral homes were relied upon to provide temporary storage of corpses, even before the deaths associated with the Black Saturday bushfires created additional demand for mortuary space.\nThroughout the heat wave, thousands of people, many of them elderly, were confirmed to have been treated by ambulance officers and placed in hospitals for heat-related illnesses in Victoria and South Australia. Ambulance Victoria reported a 70% increase in emergency calls during the week. It is estimated that around 2,000 people across Victoria and South Australia were treated for heat stroke and other effects of the heat wave.\nAccording to a Monash University study of funeral notices, more than 200 people died as a result of the heat wave. A 45% increase in the death rate was noted during the time. A subsequent report by Victoria's chief health officer, Dr John Carnie, put the final figure at 374.\nFauna and flora.\nBaby birds, possums and bats were among the wildlife not coping in the extreme heat. The RSPCA received five times the usual number of admissions to its shelters in Melbourne, with 50 possums admitted to the Burwood East shelter alone.\nThere were many reports of koalas wandering into urban yards and houses to drink water offered by residents. This behaviour is highly unusual as the animals do not normally drink water and are naturally shy of people.\nIn Melbourne, a city where most trees are non-native, notably the plane trees that line many inner and middle suburban streets, deciduous trees began shedding their leaves by early February, creating the appearance of an early autumn. Water restrictions meant many trees and plants were already stressed, and some street trees and trees in parks where councils had not arranged special watering, died, or suffered die back, as did trees and plants in private gardens.\nSee also.\nOther notable Australian heat waves:", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

It was the second of two films inspired by the story that came out at that time, the first being \"The Killing of Angel Street\" (1981).\nPlot.\nAround Christmas time, as a heatwave hits Sydney, an architect is undertaking a housing project for a brash Cockney immigrant developer, which becomes controversial when tenants and squatters refuse to move from houses intended for demolition.\nProduction.\nThe original script was called \"King's Cross\" and was written by Tim Gooding and Mark Stiles. The final script was by Phil Noyce and Mark Rosenberg. Phil Noyce:\n\"Heatwave\" was the story of a working-class Protestant boy who made good. I don't know whether audiences realised that, but we had always assumed that he was a working-class Protestant and that Judy Davis's character was a middle-class Catholic girl. She, in the Catholic saintly tradition, had adopted a social cause - had set herself up as the spokesperson and protector of the working class. He, as a working-class boy, of course, was now forced to confront the moral implications of his own success and how that affected other people. In a way, the religious and ethnic backgrounds of the two characters were just a continuation of the conflicts that we had seen in \"Newsfront\", but Australia had by this stage moved from a principally working-class and upper-class society to a principally middle-class society. That's captured in the atmosphere of inner Sydney, its buildings and the regulations of law and government.\nReception.\nReflecting on the film Noyce said:\nI\u2019d have no doubt shot it differently \u2026 told the story differently, today... Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m more conservative. I might have made the connections between the conspirators more certain, rather than implied. Heatwave belongs to a different era in Australian cinema, a time when we took a lot risks. I guess that comes with youth \u2013 the youth of the director and the youth of that second new wave of filmmakers. It was a time when there was a love affair between audiences and Australian cinema, something which these days is rather on and off.\nAwards.\nThe film was nominated for two AFI Awards in 1982.\nBox office.\n\"Heatwave\" grossed $267,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $776,970 in 2009 dollars.\nHome media.\n\"Heatwave\" was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in July 2007. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the theatrical trailer, Umbrella Entertainment trailers, a stills gallery, and an interview with Phillip Noyce, \"Sweating It Out\".", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

Extreme event attribution found this was a 1000-year weather event, made 150 times more likely by climate change, but a study in Nature Climate Change estimated it was a 200-year event. The heat wave affected Northern California, Idaho, Western Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in the United States, as well as British Columbia, and in its latter phase, Alberta, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, and Yukon, all in Canada. It also affected inland regions of Central and Southern California, Northwestern and Southern Nevada and parts of Montana, though the temperature anomalies were not as extreme as in the regions farther north.\nThe heat wave appeared due to an exceptionally strong ridge centered over the area, whose strength was linked to the effects of climate change. It resulted in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region, including the highest temperature ever measured in Canada at 49.6\u00a0\u00b0C (121.3\u00a0\u00b0F), as well as the highest temperatures in British Columbia, in the Northwest Territories, in the state of Washington as well as a tied record in Oregon. The record-high temperatures associated with the heat wave stretched from Oregon to northern Manitoba, and daily highs were set as far east as Labrador and as far southwest as Southern California. However, the Pacific Northwest suffered the vast majority of the disruption and damage connected with the extreme weather event.\nThe heat wave sparked numerous extensive wildfires, some reaching hundreds of square kilometers in area, which led to widespread disruption on the roads. One of them destroyed the village of Lytton, British Columbia, the day after it had set a record high temperature for Canada. The heat also damaged the road and rail infrastructure, forced closures of businesses, disrupted cultural events, and melted snowcaps, in some cases resulting in flooding. The heat wave also caused extensive damage to crops across the region, which was seen as likely to result in higher food prices globally, though the losses have yet to be calculated. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated that the heatwave caused at least $8.9 billion (2021 USD) in damages in the USA.\nThe death toll exceeded 1,400 people, with a death toll of at least 808 estimated in western Canada. On July\u00a06, the British Columbia Coroner Service released preliminary statistics that indicated 610 more sudden deaths than usual occurred in the province. Alberta logged 66 excess deaths the week of the heat wave. The Chief Coroner of British Columbia later said that in the week between June\u00a025 to July\u00a01, 569 deaths were confirmed to have had heat-related causes, and in a report released June 2022, the number was updated to 619. Confirmed deaths in the United States include at least 116\u00a0in Oregon (of which 72\u00a0are in Multnomah County, which includes Portland), and at least 112\u00a0in Washington and one death in Idaho; An analysis by \"The New York Times\" suggests that around 600 excess deaths occurred the week the heat wave passed through Washington and Oregon.\nMeteorological history.\nOn June\u00a023, the United States National Weather Service warned of an approaching heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, whose origins could be traced to torrential rains in China. There, the warm, moist air rose and was eventually entrained by the jet stream, which transported it east over cooler waters. When that air current encountered an upper-level high-pressure zone, also called a ridge, it started to significantly deform on June\u00a025, forcing to accommodate the high-pressure area south of the jet stream's meander. At the same time, the Southwestern states were enduring an intense drought, which had earlier allowed higher-than-average temperatures over the Southwestern United States, leading to a similar hot wave earlier in June. Its remnants then moved north to the Pacific Northwest. Six days later, Environment Canada issued a heat warning for Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Manitoba, Yukon, and Northwest Territories.\nThese conditions made way for a massive Rex block, which is more often formed during La Ni\u00f1a years. In this situation, a high-pressure area stays in place for a long time and does not let cyclones pass through it, which could have cooled the region; in this particular case, the high-pressure area was sandwiched between two stationary lows, which prevented the high-pressure region from moving anywhere. As the Pacific Northwest, just as the Southwest, experienced severe drought conditions, the already warm air was heating more quickly than usual, which intensified the ridge so strongly it caused a heat dome. Indeed, on June\u00a027, the height at which 500\u00a0hPa air pressure was sustained (geopotential height) was reported at in Prince George, British Columbiathe highest ever recorded in the area; adjacent stations have similarly reported record-high values. The downslope winds from the Cascades and other mountain ranges further warmed the air in the valleys.\nAfter the heat dome hovered over British Columbia and the Northwestern United States for a few days, it began to move eastward, breaking records east of the Rocky Mountains, particularly in the northern parts of the Prairie provinces, but bringing relief to the Pacific coast. At this stage, the heat was kept between the warm and cold fronts of the low-pressure area that formed over southern Northwest Territories and was transported eastward towards Hudson Bay. Sweltering conditions were observed as far east as Montana, Manitoba, and Northwest Ontario, \nBy July\u00a04\u20135, the remnants of the heat dome crossed Hudson Bay and, weakened somewhat by the cool waters, entered Quebec, and after that, Labrador, briefly triggering temperatures of around . \nClimate change and additional factors.\nClimate change in Canada and in the United States are widely considered to have worsened the heat wave's unprecedented intensity and duration. According to a preliminary study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, the heat wave would have been highly unlikely in the absence of anthropogenic climate change, the latter increasing the likelihood of such a heat wave at least 150-fold. According to this study, either the climate change made the heat wave more likely by increasing base temperatures and a combination of rare events, such as the recent drought and/or changes in the jet stream, resulted in the heat wave, or even a relatively small increase in mean global temperatures caused by climate change can pass a threshold that triggers a sharp increase in the probability of extreme heat wave phenomena.\nWhile it is yet unknown whether the frequency of these omega blocks is due to global heating, according to the data provided by Verisk, the Pacific Northwest is among the fastest-heating regions in the continental United States and southern Canada. Moreover, the urban heat island effect could have further exacerbated the impact in cities. Based on historic data, several meteorologists noted that this phenomenon should be expected to occur only once over a thousand or several thousand years, and David Sauchyn, a scientist at the University of Regina, said that climate models had been predicting the heat wave of a similar intensity to happen in late 2020s at the earliest.\nTemperature records.\nMuch of the Pacific Northwest, normally known for its temperate weather in June, received maximum temperatures above normal during this heat wave. In fact, the temperatures were so anomalous that nighttime lows were higher than the average high temperatures that this region would normally observe at this time of year. Ground temperatures were also reaching extremes - in Wenatchee, Washington, it reached , while the pavement at an intersection in Portland, Oregon reached .\nThis heat wave, combined with other extreme weather occurrences elsewhere, yielded the hottest June on record in North America. It also contributed to the hottest June ever for some localities such as Victoria, Abbotsford, Kamloops and Edmonton, and in Portland, Oregon, as well as one of the hottest June mean temperatures for Seattle and Spokane. On a statewide level, June 2021 was the warmest on record in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Idaho, and second warmest for Washington, Oregon and Montana, at least partly attributable to this heat wave.\nCanada.\nThe highest temperatures of the heat wave were registered in British Columbia, but areas as far east as Ontario were affected by the event. 103 all-time heat records were set across Western Canada.\nBritish Columbia.\nOn June\u00a028, records were set in Squamish, British Columbia at , Abbotsford at , Port Alberni at and Victoria at . Also, on the morning of June 28, a meteorological station at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby registered an overnight low of , \nOn June\u00a027, local records were also set in Cultus Lake, Lillooet, Ashcroft () and Kamloops (). In all, there were 59 weather stations in B.C. that set records for hottest temperatures recorded for June\u00a027. These were largely beaten in the following days (Kamloops, for instance, registered on June\u00a028 and on June\u00a029, the peak temperature recorded in a major population center in the region).\nOn June\u00a029, the temperature in Lytton, British Columbia, hit , the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada, although a nearby more modern station reported that the extreme was 1\u00a0\u00b0C lower. The stations were temporarily isolated by the Lytton wildfire the next day. The record occurred after consecutively setting new record highs of on June\u00a027 and on June\u00a028. It is also the highest temperature ever recorded north of 45\u00b0N, the highest temperature in the U.S. or Canada recorded outside the Desert Southwest, and higher than the absolute maximum temperatures of Europe or South America.\nAlberta.\nIn Alberta, the highest heat was observed in the period from June\u00a029 to July\u00a01. Banff , Beaverlodge , Cochrane , Fort McMurray , Jasper , Grande Prairie , Hendrickson Creek , Nordegg , Red Earth Creek all saw the strongest heat ever measured in these communities, most after breaking all-time records of the previous day.\nCalgary noted on June\u00a029 and July\u00a01, which stopped just 0.2\u00a0\u00b0C short of the highest observed temperature ever and beating the all-time records for June and July. Edmonton also saw temperatures approach the absolute maxima - the city centre registered on June\u00a030, while the Edmonton International Airport, near Leduc, hovered around from June\u00a029 to July\u00a01. The heat wave had largely moved east by July\u00a02, though e.g. Fort McMurray measured its fourth daily record in a row on that date.\nTerritories.\nIn the Northwest Territories, on June\u00a028, Nahanni Butte set a regional record at . Two days later, Fort Smith, just north of the Alberta border, reached , which beat the previous all-time territorial record, registered in the same place in 1941. It was also the new highest reliably recorded temperature above 60 degrees latitude.\nYukon was largely bypassed by the heat wave, but on June\u00a028, some areas in the territory went over , including Whitehorse () and Teslin (), both of which were daily records. Teslin also beat the record for June\u00a029, at .\nSaskatchewan.\nSaskatchewan's heat records were mainly concentrated in the northern parts of the province. Stony Rapids saw the mercury reach on June\u00a030, an all-time high and record temperatures were also set at Key Lake Airport, sometimes dubbed \"the cold pole of Saskatchewan\", and Collins Bay Airport on July\u00a01, both at , as well as in Uranium City (). July highs were also observed in these settlements on the first day of the month, when 26 daily records were set across the province, most in northern communities.\nElsewhere, the heat arrived slightly later. Saskatoon reached on July\u00a01 and beat the monthly record the following day, at , a tenth of degree below the all-time record. La Ronge registered an all-time high with a reading of . Regina, like most of the southern part of the province was spared the extremes reached in the northern parts, with a maximum of on July\u00a02. The heat wave over Saskatchewan largely dissipated by July\u00a03 and moved east.\nManitoba.\nIn a similar way to Saskatchewan, the majority of heat records (including all-time highs) were noted in the northern parts of the province. A remote community of Tadoule Lake observed , beating the previous all-time record by , so did Lynn Lake (), while Churchill, on the shore of Hudson Bay, registered , the highest temperature for July.\nOther parts of the province did not see heat as extreme as elsewhere, though 25\u00a0daily records were set on July\u00a03, including in Winnipeg.\nOntario.\nNorthwestern Ontario did not see all-time high records beaten, but several daily records were pushed higher: on July\u00a03, Thunder Bay equalled , Geraldton saw , while the hottest temperature was in Pickle Lake, at .\nNewfoundland and Labrador.\nWeakened by interaction with the Hudson Bay waters, and having not set any record in Quebec, the heat wave arrived to the mainland part of Newfoundland and Labrador, but before dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean, it still managed to beat some daily records. Hopedale registered on July\u00a05, while Happy Valley-Goose Bay reached the following day.\nUnited States.\nThe heat wave broke numerous records by large margins. Several large cities, including Portland, Seattle, and Spokane, experienced high temperatures far exceeding and low temperatures higher than the area's normal daily high temperatures. The heat wave beat Washington's all-time heat record in Hanford () and tied one for Oregon ( at two places, including at Pelton Dam). The same temperature was noted in Peshastin in Chelan County, Washington, where temperatures soared to on June\u00a029, slightly surpassing the previous all-time high for the state.\nOregon.\nOn June\u00a026, Portland broke its previous all-time record high temperature of , set in July\u00a01965 and August\u00a01981, with a temperature of . It topped that record again on June\u00a027, with a temperature of . The following day, the temperature increased further to . These extremes also beat the previous record June temperature, set on June\u00a026, 2006.\nSalem, Oregon, reached on June\u00a026, its record high temperature for June. It then hit degrees on June\u00a027, breaking the record for the highest temperature ever recorded in that city, which was previously . Salem then exceeded the previous day's record temperature on June\u00a028, with a maximum temperature of . However, not all the regions of the mid-Willamette Valley experienced extreme heat on June\u00a028. Regions south of Salem, for example, did not see highs above mid-90s Fahrenheit on that day, likely due to cooler ocean air in the area.\nThe Willamette Valley also experienced extreme overnight temperature drops (twice the size of normal fluctuations) due to cooler air coming from the oceanPortland cooled a record during the night, while Salem almost approached its all-time largest temperature swing, from to .\nWashington.\nBetween 1894, when the records in Seattle began, and June\u00a02021, temperatures over were only noted three times; however, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport recorded three consecutive days of temperatures over . The temperature rose to on June\u00a027, beating the previous record of 103, only for the record to be broken again the following day by a high of . All of these values broke the previous June record (, 2017) by a large margin. The suburbs farther from the coast were even hottera local radio station in Maple Valley reported temperatures of .\nOn June\u00a026, Port Angeles recorded an all-time record high of . The Quillayute Airport weather station, also on the Olympic Peninsula, reported on June\u00a028, exceeding its prior record by .\nOn Mount Rainier, normally freezing temperatures reached degrees above on June\u00a027. The heat wave was blamed for greater glacier melt on Mt. Rainier than had been seen in the state in the past 100 years.\nEast of the Cascades, multiple locations such as Spokane measured record-breaking or -tying temperatures, beating several records over the period of a few days. On June\u00a029, Spokane, Ephrata and Omak all reached their all-time records, at , and , respectively. These are the hottest temperatures measured since records began for those areas. Extremely warm minimum temperatures were also noted: Ephrata's thermometers did not go lower than on June\u00a028 and on June\u00a029, and all-time highest low temperature records were set at Spokane International Airport on June\u00a029 () and June\u00a030 (), during overnight hours.\nIt was even hotter on and near the Oregon-Washington border. In The Dalles, Oregon and Dallesport, on either side of the Columbia River, daytime high temperatures reached , tying the then all-time record for the state of Washington and beating the June statewide record by 5 degrees Fahrenheit. The same heat was measured in Tri-Cities on June\u00a028\u201329. The state's new official temperature record was set at on June\u00a029 in Hanford. The heat wave resulted in 128 all-time high temperature records set for individual weather stations across the state, including in Seattle.\nCalifornia.\nTemperature records were observed in the northern part of the state. South Lake Tahoe observed on June\u00a028, beating the previous June record, and tied or beaten daily records for three days in a row. In Redding, the temperatures soared to on June\u00a027, a daily record, while in Siskiyou County, Montague tied an all-time high for the county, at .\nSouthern California was also impacted. Palm Springs registered on June\u00a027, surpassing the previous daily record, while other communities, such as Palmdale, Campo and Idyllwild, tied with them.\nIdaho.\nBeing largely on the margin of the high pressure dome, Idaho did not see temperatures as extreme as elsewhere. In Lewiston, on the border with Washington, was noted on June\u00a029, beating an all-time June record and becoming the third-highest temperature in the history of recordings for the city. Other localities in the Treasure Valley to the east were expected to sustain triple-digit heat for a week (which is in and of itself unusual) and in general to tie or beat daily records. Boise, for example, tied one for June\u00a029 () and for June\u00a030 (), and also recorded nine consecutive days of temperatures exceeding , which tied the record for such a streak. Records were also beaten in the Idaho Panhandle, with Coeur d'Alene registering , which surpassed the previous highest temperature for June and equaled the all-time high for the city.\nMontana.\nMost of Montana was placed on heat advisories, but the areas that were most affected by the heat wave were on the extreme northwest and eastern parts of the state. Kalispell and Missoula registered temperatures of on June\u00a029, both daily records and 1\u00a0\u00b0F short of the record for June; Libby succeeded in doing so, setting the plank at . In the eastern parts of the state, several daily records were also noted: Livingston reached on June\u00a030 and Miles City saw two days later; Billings tied its daily record on July\u00a01 and had not fallen below on July\u00a03, while Glasgow bettered its July\u00a01 record to , tied the daily high record the next day, and set the highest minimum temperatures on these days ( on July\u00a02).\nDeaths and injuries.\nCanada.\nThe heat wave was the deadliest weather event in Canadian history.\nOver 1,000 deaths occurred due to the direct consequences of the heat wave (such as hyperthermia). Most of the deaths occurred in Canada \u2013 about 600 more deaths than usual were noted in British Columbia and 66 in Alberta. It still unknown whether any of the excess deaths in Alberta were related to the heat wave, but the Chief Coroner of British Columbia stated that 569 casualties could be attributed to heat. A later report put the heat-related death toll at 619. She also said that in the prior five years, only three heat-related casualties had been registered. Among the deaths reported to the provincial coroner, Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health authorities saw several times more deaths than usual, and the Vancouver Island and Interior Health health districts noted double the expected number of dead during the week from June 25 to July 1. Most of the deaths were registered on June 29.\nIn British Columbia, E-Comm emergency dispatchers answered nearly 15,300 calls on June\u00a026-27, which was about above normal for the month, and also deployed the ambulances 1,850 times on June 27 and 1,975 the following day - the highest number ever recorded for the province. Delays for non-emergency calls reached up to 16 hours in extreme cases. In addition to that, some ambulances were left inoperable as the emergency service was understaffed. These setbacks led to hours-long delays. The handling of the crisis drew criticism from the paramedics unions, which forced Adrian Dix, the provincial healthcare minister, to change the leader of British Columbia's emergencies response management to Jim Chu, former Vancouver's police chief, and to appoint a chief ambulance officer.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the death toll was lower but still in the hundreds: at least 116 deaths with confirmed heat-related causes in Oregon (72 in Multnomah County), at least 112\u00a0in Washington and one in Idaho. \"The New York Times\" analysis suggested that almost 450 excess deaths in Washington and 160 deaths in Oregon occurred during the heat wave, though it has not been demonstrated how many were related to the heat. For comparison, however, Oregon had only 12 heat-related deaths 2017\u20132019. Most of the deaths occurred among the elderly.\nOn July\u00a013,\u00a02021, Multnomah County, Oregon published an analysis which found that a majority of deaths occurred in households which had no air conditioning or had only fans.\nA surge in 9-1-1 calls and emergency department visits related to the heat saw 1,100 people were hospitalized in Oregon and Washington; and almost 2,800 heat-related emergency department visits were made on July 25\u201330. The Washington Department of Health estimated that over 2,000 such visits occurred statewide, not including visits to Veteran Administration or the military hospitals. In Portland, the number of calls and the response times doubled, setting a record for the area. On the other hand, in Oregon, while the number of heat-related visits skyrocketed, the total number of emergency visits stayed in the expected range. Non-emergency municipal services were also strained\u2014on June 26, the non-emergency health information service (2-1-1) did not respond to 750 heat-related calls due to lack of working staff.\nSome deaths also occurred among those seeking cooling in the Pacific Northwest's rivers. Two swimmers in Salem, who were trying to escape the heat, went missing in the Willamette River, another did so in Portland, while in Washington, three people drowned. With 30 deaths in King County, it was the deadliest weather event in the county. In fact, with 112 deaths, this became the deadliest weather event in Washington State history. The total damage in Washington State was between $500 million and $1 billion.\nImpact.\nAir conditioning.\nThe heat wave was a problem for major cities in the Northwest. Seattle and Portland had the lowest and third-lowest percentage of air-conditioned households among major metro areas in the United States, respectively. In 2015, a U.S. Census Bureau survey found that only 33% of Seattle homes have air conditioning (A/C) units, but that number increased to 44% in the 2019 survey, likely due to the warming trend in that area (Portland had 79% coverage, which was still below the national average). The rate of air-conditioned households was even lower in British Columbia despite marked increases over the years \u2013 BC Hydro estimated that only 34% of the province's residents were using these cooling appliances, while a separate analysis indicated that only 21% of Metro Vancouver's households used air conditioning in\u00a02017 (the number was only slightly higher for Edmonton and Calgary, at 29% and 24%, respectively). Authorities therefore waived restrictions related to COVID-19 for designated cooling shelters in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\nTrying to stay cool, residents in the Pacific Northwest and Alberta rushed to buy A/C units, which significantly increased their prices (some double the normal), created long installation and delivery backlogs, and ultimately made them unavailable in many stores. The pent-up demand for cooling forced electricity consumption to soar to record-high summer values. BC Hydro reported a peak of 8,500\u00a0MW, AESO registered 11,721\u00a0MW (8 MW short of an all-time high), SaskPower recorded 3,547\u00a0MW, while several electricity providers in Washington also logged record values. It also prompted power utilities in Alberta, Idaho (Idaho Power) and eastern Washington (Avista) to formally ask to conserve energy. The warning had the Idaho State Capitol voluntarily turn off lights as a result, while in the Spokane area, power outages were rolled in an attempt to prevent strain on the power grid.\nSome residents chose to shelter from the heat by booking rooms in hotels, which often ran out of air-conditioned accommodation. According to CoStar calculations, the search for cooled rooms made the hotel occupancy in British Columbia reach the highest levels since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, while Washington County, Oregon (suburbs of Portland) hotels reported occupancy levels at or exceeding of total capacity on June 26\u201328, more than double the rate from 2020.\nInfrastructure.\nThe heat wave strained and damaged the region's infrastructure. It caused the sidewalks to buckle due to thermal expansion of concrete (57 sidewalks were damaged in Edmonton alone). In Washington and Oregon, damage was even more severe, leading to closures of roads and other inconveniences for drivers, including on some lanes of Interstate 5, as well as some state highways. In order to prevent thermal fatigue to Seattle's steel drawbridges, the city announced it would hose them down with cool water.\nPublic transportation also deteriorated during the sweltering conditions. Trains on Link light rail and Sounder commuter rail in Seattle operated at reduced speeds as a precaution against possible deformation of railroad tracks and overhead lines. In the Portland metropolitan area, TriMet suspended MAX Light Rail and WES Commuter Rail service for part of June\u00a027 and all of June\u00a028 because the cables from which the light rail cars drew electricity had sagged. Heat-induced rail distortion, called sun kink, slowed down the passenger service on the route of the Amtrak Cascades. Moreover, school districts in Kamloops, Sooke (BC), Ephrata and Royal City (WA) all suspended school bus services, while Grant County, Washington limited the frequency of the buses under their management as they did not offer air conditioning or the built-in version could not cope with the heat.\nOn June\u00a028, 15 school districts in British Columbia's Lower Mainland, including all districts within Vancouver, closed due to the heat and their lack of sufficient cooling infrastructure; many others also changed, or shortened, Tuesday schedules to avoid daytime high temperatures. COVID-19 vaccination sites also endured disruption because of the weather conditions.\nBusinesses and workers.\nLocal businesses faced a choice to continue to work under oppressive heat or make a day off. Some restaurants, food stands and caf\u00e9s closed, fearing excessive heat at the workplace or spoilage of solid products. Similarly, numerous grocers were forced to shut down aisles and halt the sale of perishable goods or use plastic sheets as impromptu thermal shields, as refrigeration units failed under the load. The businesses that decided to stay open often provided \"de facto\" sheltering from heat or converted parts of buildings to cooling centers, such as Amazon.\nIn a few cases, workers in California and Oregon protested the lack of air conditioning and staged local walkouts, and agricultural trade unions had also noted increased calls to strike. An SMS survey among 2,176 farmworkers in Washington (mostly in the eastern part of the state) conducted by United Farm Workers, a labor union, reported that almost all farmers did not consider protections mandated by the state OSHA sufficient. Among the surveyed, about two-fifths reported not having had shade, just under a third not having received heat illness prevention training and a quarter of respondents had no access to cool water.\nAfter Sebastian Francisco Perez, an outdoor farm worker in St. Paul, Oregon, died while at work, Oregon OSHA faced calls to enforce safety rules for dealing with the heat wave, which had been first drafted in May. In response, Oregon's governor, Kate Brown, directed the agency to enforce the safety regulations for 180 days pending permanent implementation. In Washington state, the heat wave prompted state agencies to roll out additional protections. \"The Washington Post\" reported that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration was also considering a set of heat-related safety rules, whose implementation was said to be a \"top priority\" for the Biden administration.\nCulture and sports.\nSports events were disrupted by the heat wave. In Eugene, where the qualifiers for the 2020\u00a0Summer Olympics were held, the heat caused evacuation of the stadium in the afternoon and postponement of some events to the evening hours, as the temperature of the stadium's track exceeded . It also caused an athlete to withdraw from the race.\nAmong other disruptions, a public swimming pool in Seattle's Rainier Beach neighborhood was closed due to dangerously high deck temperatures, so was a senior's center in Rathdrum, Idaho and a golf course on Vancouver Island. Some local concerts were also moved to avoid the heat.\nAgriculture.\nFarms have experienced serious losses, as the heat wave baked the fruits and berries or otherwise destroyed the crop and the drought conditions worsened.\n10 million pounds of fruit a day were being harvested in the Pacific Northwest at the time the heat wave struck. Farmers in Eastern Washington, facing a loss of the cherry and blueberry crop, sent workers into orchards at night to avoid the heat in the day. The British Columbia provincial fruit growers association estimated that 50 to 70 percent of the cherry crop was damaged, effectively \"cooked\" in the orchards. Raspberry and blackberry farms in the Lower Mainland, Oregon and Washington have also endured losses. In Whatcom County, Washington, which produces four-fifths of raspberries in the United States, estimates varied from quarter to half of the harvest; elsewhere, they went as high as 80-90%. Lettuce producers in the Okanagan Valley were also reported to be struggling with spoilt crops, so were those who grew Christmas trees and apples. In contrast, grapevines in Oregon and Washington did not seem to have sustained much damage, and corn in Skagit County, Washington was growing much ahead of schedule.\nFarmers in the United States have also seen reduced yields of soft wheat, which additionally saw the quality deteriorate (68% of wheat harvest in the Pacific Northwest was estimated by the USDA to be of poor or very poor condition). In the Prairie provinces, an infestation of grasshoppers is threatening cash crops and farmers were reported to be struggling with feeding cattle as hay and forage was found to be in short supply. Saskatchewan has therefore extended additional drought support for farmers. In Alberta, lack of rain and excessive heat saw some grain plants catch fire, which has put the harvest in jeopardy. Beaumont, Alberta issued a mandatory ban on non-essential water usage, citing drought conditions. Further east, St. Laurent and Armstrong, Manitoba declared a \"state of agricultural disaster\" as the heat wave worsened the drought in the region, whose water reserves were already depleted.\nEnvironment.\nWildfires.\nThe heat event sparked significant fires across the West Coast and Western Canada. One of the first fires to have struck the region was the Lava Fire, burning west of Mount Shasta, California, caused by a lightning strike on June\u00a025, and which eventually burned around on the west slope of one of the highest peaks in the state. Some of the largest fires, such as the Beckwourth Complex Fire, grew over . Strong winds, which were causing fire tornadoes in some places, and dry vegetation hampered efforts to contain the fires. This led to road closures, such as the U.S. Route 97 and the North Cascades Highway, suspension of airport operations in Redmond, Oregon, and evacuation of settlements adjacent to the fires. The winds were so strong that residents of Medford, Oregon, \u00a0 north of the fires, reported having seen ash falling from the sky.\nAmong the most known fires was the one that burst in the evening of June\u00a030 in British Columbia. Then, Lytton, the settlement that had been beating national heat records in the previous days, along with several First Nations reserves, were ordered to be evacuated as a likely human-caused fire was approaching to the village, where it later did widespread destruction to the buildings. A local MP, Brad Vis, estimated damage to the settlement at\u00a090%, while a local resident said that only \"four or five houses, the post office and the church were still standing.\" The fire damaged roads, telecommunication and power facilities as well as the railway that comes through the settlement; two people died while hiding from the flames. The fire in the settlement forced the closure of a section of British Columbia Highway\u00a01, part of Trans-Canada Highway, as well as Highway\u00a012, which ends in Lytton. In total, 300 fires were ravaging the province as of July\u00a013, and the wildfire season destroyed around of forests by July\u00a015. Pyrocumulonimbus clouds formed due to such extensive burning, producing several hundred thousand lightning strikes in one day and further complicating efforts to contain fires.\nDespite deployment of more than 9,000 firefighters in the United States to extinguish them by July\u00a01 and more than 17,000 by mid-July, the size and number of the fires grew. Almost of forest were consumed by large wildfires, and more than were burnt in the United States as of July 15. The intensity of the fires moved the US fire preparedness alert level to 5 (highest) by July 14, which was an early start of the wildfire season. In addition to that, Governors Kate Brown of Oregon, Jay Inslee of Washington and Brad Little of Idaho declared states of emergency due to the extreme risk of wildfires. The Canadian army officials set up a coordination center in Edmonton in order to assist wildfire actions in British Columbia, which would be directed until July\u00a019. Higher-than-average burning also appeared in Albertan, Saskatchewan and Manitoba forests.\nAs the extreme heat and dry conditions persisted, scientists, firefighters and various politicians urged residents not to use fireworks during Independence Day celebrations in the Western United States and on Canada Day in Alberta. In addition to that, Washington and British Columbia enacted state-/provincewide bans on most open fires, and Washington authorities also issuing a total fire ban in state parks. Idaho and Manitoba were using more regionalized approaches, though the latter suspended all burning permits provincewide.\nGlacier melt.\nExtreme temperatures were also noted for mountain regions, which accelerated the melting of glaciers. Extensive melting occurred in the snowcaps of Banff National Park, which a glaciologist estimated that the Albertan snow from the mountains melted three times faster than usual. On Mount Rainier, the heat wave caused the mass of the snow cap to shrink by 30%, and Washington's glaciers in general have come through what glaciologists say to be the strongest melting episode in 100 years. Additionally, the increased melting of glaciers caused high amounts of runoff to be present within some rivers. The unexpected snowmelt blocked some high mountain roads in Whatcom County, Washington and rendered three hiking trails in British Columbia impassable. More importantly, it caused flash flooding down the creeks and rivers, which the glaciers feed. This triggered i.a. a week-long evacuation order in the Pemberton Valley extreme water rises were also noted in Squamish, and flood alerts were issued for other parts of British Columbia. Soot from wildfires (\u2192 2021 British Columbia wildfires) is further expected to diminish the mass of ice.\nWildlife and fisheries.\nAs the surrounding air was extremely hot, water temperatures rose, which proved to be a hazard for aquatic wildlife. On the Pacific shore, temperatures in the intertidal zone reached up to and more than a billion seashore animals, like clams, barnacles and oysters, died as a result of heat wave, impacting water quality. The deaths also impacted seafood producers, who faced losses of produce as it baked in the heatwave and started rotting. Inland, the population of sockeye salmon in Idaho rivers was preventatively caught out of water as increasing temperatures made it prone to disease; some salmon was also transported to cooler waters in the Columbia River. Fish kill, however, was not prevented in Albertan aquifers and appeared earlier than expected.\nThe heat wave caused an increase in vibrio bacteria levels in oysters in the Pacific Northwest, causing a record number of people to be sickened from vibriosis, an intestinal disease caused by the bacteria. The Washington State Department of Health urged people not to eat raw oysters and other shellfish from the region due to the risk of bacterial contamination.\nOn the land, trees in Metro Vancouver dried up and started shedding leaves; the same happened to the fir canopy in Oregon on the side where the trees faced the sun, and reportedly also in Lytton just before the wildfire swept through the community. Birds have also come through distress - in Seattle, nearly a hundred juvenile terns, whose nests were on top of an industrial building, died when they plunged to the pavement below, presumably trying to escape the heat - those that survived were treated for burns. Scores of British Columbian raptors, apart from heat exhaustion, were suffering from dehydration and starvation.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The United Kingdom experienced three heatwaves; the first was for three days in June, the second for three days in July, and the third for six days in August. These were periods of unusually hot weather caused by rising high pressure up from the European continent. There were also more grass fires and wildfires than average, and in August a drought was declared in many regions.\nThe Met Office issued its first red warning for extreme heat on 8 July, which affected all of central and southern England and was in place for 18 and 19 July. On 15 July, it declared a national emergency after the red warning was put in place. On 19 July, a record temperature of was recorded and verified by the Met Office in Coningsby, England, breaking the previous record set in 2019 of in Cambridge, England. The heatwaves caused substantial disruption to transport.\nClimatologists say the extreme heat was due to climate change. In 2022, there were nearly 25,000 wildfires across the country.\nJune heatwave.\nOn the three days from 15 June to 17 June, temperatures in Kew, London, reached at least , the official heatwave threshold at that location for that time of year. On 17 June, a high of was recorded in Santon Downham, Suffolk.\nA level two heat-health alert was issued by the UK Health Security Agency to cover the East Midlands and south-west on 15 June. A level three alert was issued for London and South East England the following day.\nThe heatwave ended on 18 June, as temperatures fell by an average of . A \"huge cluster\" of thunderstorms moved across the UK, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow warning for lightning for Southern England (lightning warnings had only been issued on three previous occasions). It was also reported that the UK could experience up to a further four heatwaves over the summer, and weather experts had called for heatwaves to be given names in the same way that winter storms are named.\nImpact on resorts.\nCrowds arrived at swimming pools, parks, seaside destinations in the south and east of England early in the morning of 17 June. Seafront car parks at Bournemouth, Dorset, were said to be full by midday.\nJuly heatwave.\nOn 8 July, the Met Office issued a heat-health alert warning that there was a 90% probability of level 3 alert criteria being met in parts of England on 9 July. On 12 July, the Met Office issued an amber extreme heat warning for 17 July, which was extended from 17 to 19 July. It was stated that the high temperatures could extend into the following week. By 13 July, the water levels at the Thruscross Reservoir fell low enough to reveal the ruins of West End, a village which was flooded when the reservoir was built in 1966.\nOn 15 July, the UKHSA increased the Heatwave Alert Level to 4, \"illness and death occurring among the fit and healthy \u2013 and not just in high-risk groups\". The Met Office issued its first ever red extreme heat warning after there were forecasts of over in some parts of England, and a national emergency was declared. The warning was in place from 18 to 19 July, with most of England being affected.\nThe amber extreme heat warning was extended to cover Cornwall, west Wales and parts of southern Scotland. A number of schools announced they would either close or allow pupils to wear PE kit in place of their school uniform on the hottest days.\nOn 17 July, the first day of the amber warning, the highest temperature recorded was in Hawarden, Wales. The highest temperature in England was in Nantwich, and the highest in Scotland was in Auchincruive. Northern Ireland reached in Armagh.\nOn 18 July, the first day of the red warning, temperatures reached in Santon Downham, Suffolk. Wales broke its record for the highest recorded temperature, with recorded in Hawarden. The Channel Islands had a new record temperature as was recorded in St Helier. The highest temperature in Scotland was in Aboyne, and the highest in Northern Ireland was in Derrylin. Cornwall reached in Bude, breaking the county's record of set during the 1976 British Isles heatwave.\nBetween 18 and 19 July, the United Kingdom experienced its highest recorded minimum night time temperature, at at Shirburn Model Farm, Oxfordshire. This is an increase of 2.9 \u00b0C from the previous record, set in Brighton in August 1990. Temperatures in many other parts of the country did not fall below , giving the UK its warmest tropical night on record.\nOn 19 July, a temperature of was recorded at Coningsby, Lincolnshire, the hottest temperature ever recorded in the United Kingdom's history. Before that day, the previous record of was recorded in Cambridge during the 2019 European heatwaves. This record was broken in at least 34 places across England on 19 July, six of which were over 40 \u00b0C, the Met Office reported, stating \"the UK\u2019s recent extreme heat was far more intense and widespread than previous comparable heatwaves\". Scotland had its highest temperature ever after was recorded at Charterhall, breaking the record of recorded during the 2003 European heatwave. Aysgarth Falls, a popular waterfall in the Yorkshire Dales, almost completely dried up after the high temperatures and no rainfall in the area for many weeks.\nBritish minister Kit Malthouse told parliament that at least 13 people died in water-related incidents during the heatwave and that at least 41 properties were destroyed in London and more than a dozen elsewhere in Britain.\nImpact.\nTransport.\nNetwork Rail announced that the East Coast Main Line, servicing all stations between London King's Cross and York &amp; Leeds, would close on most of the day on 19 July. Many companies such as Greater Anglia, Great Western Railways and LNER introduced amended timetables, imposing speed restrictions on their trains to avoid track buckling. Transport for London urged people to make only essential journeys on 18 and 19 July.\nOn 18 July, all flights at Luton Airport were suspended after the high temperatures led to a surface defect on one of the runways. Flights out of the airport resumed at 17:40, more than two hours after they stopped just after 15:00. The RAF halted all flights in and out of RAF Brize Norton, the largest RAF station in the UK, because the 'runway melted'. The rail temperature in Suffolk hit , which was the highest ever recorded rail temperature in the UK.\nOn 19 July, Network Rail issued a \"do not travel\" warning ahead of the extreme temperatures. No services ran into or out of London King's Cross all day, and no Thameslink or Great Northern services were running north of London. East Midlands Railway was running very limited services between Derby, Nottingham, Luton, Bedford and London, which stopped entirely during the hottest part of the day. The East Coast Main Line south of York was closed, as well as the Sheffield Supertram network. All trains between Euston railway station and Milton Keynes were suspended after a fire began by the track.\nRoads across the country began to melt as surface temperatures exceeded in Lincolnshire. Among these roads was the A14, which was closed westbound between J36 and J35 for hours after a part of the road \"rose and then cracked\". A part of the A11 was closed both ways after there was damage to one of the lanes.\nRetail.\nA corner shop in Scunthorpe lost around \u00a31,000 worth of goods when its entire stock of chocolate melted during the heatwave.\nMajor supermarkets in London reported having sold-out of bottled water, ice cream, and ice lollies during the heatwave, and increased sales of paddling pools and burgers. Waitrose reported a 36 per cent year on year increase in the sales of ice cream. John Lewis reported a 709 per cent year on year increase in sales of fans and air conditioning units. Iceland reported 16 July 2022 as its best ever day for ice cream sales, at 12 per cent above its previous highest day, which was in 2019. Ice cream parlours have struggled to meet the increase in demand.\nLuxury chocolate products retailer, Hotel Chocolat, suspended their delivery service because of the hot weather.\nBerry farming.\nThere was an impact on berry farming as hot weather increases the demand for them, and good weather helps farmers to meet that demand as berries ripen quicker. Farmers dropped the prices of strawberries and cherries as bumper crops, about 10-15 per cent more than usual, were produced during the heatwave. Low rainfall and prolonged sunshine in Kent, Herefordshire, Lancashire, and Norfolk provided excellent growing conditions, promoting the strong growth of ripe sweet berries.\nSeaside resorts.\nBetween 10 and 13 July there was an average increase of 15 per cent in the number of visitors to seaside resorts compared to the previous year.\nUtilities.\nOn 25 July, \"Bloomberg News\" reported that South East London had narrowly avoided experiencing a blackout on 20 July, after the increase in demand for electricity caused by the hot weather. It was prevented by the National Grid purchasing electricity from Belgium at the highest price the UK had ever paid. They were reported to have paid \u00a39,724 per megawatt hour, 5,000% more than the typical price.\nAftermath.\nWeather forecasters from the BBC, Met Office and the Royal Meteorological Society were subjected to online abuse and questioned validity over their coverage of the heatwave, most prompted by reports that linked it to climate change.\nOn 19 July, steep lapse rates in the mid troposphere associated with the plume of hot air led to the development of a line of elevated dry thunderstorms that initiated along a cold front, affecting mostly southern England, progressing eastwards throughout the day and overnight. These storms produced very little precipitation, with accumulations of just 1-2mm in places. This, combined with frequent cloud-to-ground lightning and tinder dry vegetation, created additional fire hazards. Several thousand lightning strikes were detected, causing at least one residential fire.\nOn 3 August, Marks and Spencer announced that it would stop selling disposable barbecues \"to help protect open spaces and reduce the risk of fires\". Their decision followed calls by London Fire Brigade for retailers to stop selling them. Along with Aldi and Waitrose, who stopped in March over concern about the impact of their use on the environment, Sainsbury's and Tesco joined the list of supermarkets to stop selling disposable barbecues on 11 August, and were followed by Morrisons and the Co-op the next day.\nAugust heatwave.\nAnother heatwave began on 9 August. An amber extreme heat weather warning for most of England and Wales was put in place, as well as a level 3 heat health alert for central and southern England and a level 2 alert for northern England.\nIn August, Tom Morgan, a Met Office meteorologist, said that \"temperatures will not go as high as they did during July\" but will last over \"a prolonged period\" with \"temperatures in the low-30s\". On 8 August the UK Health Security Agency issued a level 3 heat health alert for central and southern England effective from 9 to 13 August, which was later extended to 14 August.\nThe highest temperature recorded in the UK on 11 August was in Wiggonholt, West Sussex. The London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner said that in the first week of August 2021 they attended 42 grassland and wildland fires, whilst in the same week in 2022 they attended 340, an increase of over 700%.\nOn 13 August, a set of safety barriers on the A63 road at South Cave buckled in the heat, less than a year after being installed the previous winter.\nThe highest temperature on 14 August was , recorded in Charlwood, Surrey.\nAt least three people drowned.\nRain.\nAlthough 14 August was the final day of the extremely hot weather, temperatures remained above the seasonal average into the following day. On 15 August, heavy rain and thunderstorms moved across the UK. The Met Office issued three days of weather alerts for 15, 16 and 17 August, warning of a risk of flash flooding in some areas. An amber weather warning for thunderstorms was issued for parts of south west England, covering most of Devon and parts of Cornwall and Somerset.\nTorrential rain and thunderstorms brought flash flooding to parts of London and South East England on 17 August. The heavy rain also resulted in raw sewage being discharged into the sea in some places after sewers overflowed. A number of pollution warnings were in place for beaches in England and Wales.\nImpact.\nRetail.\nThere was another increase in ice cream sales, during the August heatwave, with the smaller retailers having challenges meeting the demand.\nGardening.\nBecause of the prolonged hot weather, gardeners reported an increased ability to grow plants that would usually have difficulty flourishing in the UK, such as figs and avocados.\nDrought.\nThe Met Office said rainfall between January and June 2022 was the lowest since 1976, giving England its driest start to the year for 46 years. It was confirmed that England had experienced its driest July since 1935, with parts of the country having the least rainfall on record. The south east and central southern England had the driest July since records began in 1836, with an average of 5.0mm rainfall.\nOn 26 July, and with water supplies beginning to run low, the National Drought Group met to discuss a strategy for dealing with the conditions. Although the group stopped short of declaring a drought, it was reported the UK's water companies had started to put the early stages of their drought policies into motion by urging people to conserve water. On 29 July, Southern Water became the first water company to introduce a hosepipe ban. The measure, affecting Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, was scheduled to come into force from 5 August. Following a prolonged dry spell in South East England, on 3 August South East Water announced a temporary hosepipe ban for Kent and Sussex from 12 August. On 4 August Welsh Water announced a hosepipe ban for Pembrokeshire and parts of Carmarthenshire, which had experienced their driest summer since 1976, commencing on 19 August. On 7 August, with another heatwave expected to occur in the coming days, George Eustace, the Secretary of State for the Environment, urged water companies to impose further hosepipe bans. On 9 August Thames Water announced plans to introduce a hosepipe ban for its 15 million customers; the ban was subsequently confirmed to begin on 24 August. On 12 August, Yorkshire Water became the fifth water company to announce a hosepipe ban, which will come into place on 26 August. It is their first hosepipe ban in 27 years.\nOn 12 August, a drought was officially declared in eight of the 14 Environment Agency areas: Devon and Cornwall, Solent and South Downs, Kent and South London, Herts and North London, East Anglia, Thames, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, and the East Midlands. John Curtin, executive director of local operations for the Environment Agency, warned lack of water would be an issue for several months, and that the UK would need above average rainfall through the autumn and winter to avoid another drought in 2023. A drought was declared in the West Midlands region on 23 August, with the Environment Agency warning it had been using groundwater resources and reserves from reservoirs in Wales to help maintain the flows of the River Severn, which supplies six million people in the area. On 30 August, a drought was declared in South West England, covering Bristol, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Dorset and parts of Wiltshire.\nOn 19 August, the Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales declared a drought in south west Wales, and specifically in north Ceredigion, Teifi, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthen, Swansea, Llanelli, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend.\nWildfires.\n &lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nOn 14 August, Mark Hardingham, chair of the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC), said that the hot and dry conditions in 2022 had resulted in a 200% increase in the number of wildfires compared to the previous year. There were 247 wildfires in 2021, and 745 in 2022 as of 14 August.\nMeteorology.\nAccording to Met Office estimates, extreme heat has been made ten times more likely because of climate change in the United Kingdom. Extreme event attribution by World Weather Attribution initiative showed that \"without human-caused climate change temperatures of 40\u00b0C in the UK would have been extremely unlikely\".\nProvisional figures published by the Met Office on 1 September 2022 indicated England had experienced its joint hottest summer during 2022, with an average temperature of 17.1\u00b0C during June, July and August. This was comparable with the summer of 2018.\nMedia coverage.\nSocial media misinformation and conspiracy theories compared the July heatwave to the 1976 heatwave, and claimed that the effect of both were exaggerated. The maximum temperature in 2022 exceeded 1976's peak temperature of . The BBC reported that \"suggestions that there is nothing unusual about this heatwave appear to have found a willing audience among climate change sceptics\". An image circulated on social media claiming that the colour scale of new style Met Office forecast maps had been \"designed to look like fear and destruction\", with the meteorologist who had created the map's colour scales saying that although the scale had been altered in 2021 for the benefit of colour blind viewers, the image being shared had been doctored to exaggerate this.\nOn 19 July 2022, Extinction Rebellion activists smashed windows of The News Building in London in response to coverage of the heatwave by \"The Sun\" and \"The Times\".\nWriting for the \"Columbia Journalism Review\", journalist Jon Allsop criticised right-leaning British publications in particular for downplaying and detracting from the effects on the hottest days before covering them more seriously following the series of wildfires. He analysed American media coverage and determined it to be heavily focused on the United Kingdom despite heatwaves elsewhere in Europe, the United States and the Global South due to inequity and the image of a \"cold and wet Britain\". Allsop also found that, while climate change has had more attention in stories on the heatwave, media exploration of its role and impact is still limited and lacking.\nAnalysis.\nOn 7 October 2022, a joint report published by the Office for National Statistics and UK Health Security Agency indicated there had been 3,000 more deaths in England and Wales than would usually be expected during the summer, the highest number of excessive deaths since 2004. The report indicated that most of the extra deaths occurred in those aged over 65, and in the hottest days towards the end of July.\nMet Office data published on 14 October 2022 indicated that temperature records were broken at 56 of the UK's 109 oldest weather stations during the July heat wave.\nOn 5 January 2023, the Met Office confirmed that 2022 was the UK's warmest year since records began in 1884, with an average annual temperature above for the first time.", "matches": ["heat wave", "heat waves"], "label": []}

To date, it is the country's worst heat wave to have existed.\nAccording to weather historian Maximiliano Herrera, it is the most severe heat wave recorded anywhere in the world.\nHistory.\nAccording to the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), the national average temperature was listed as 21.3\u00a0\u00b0C in June. It was 0.9 degrees higher than in the same period last year, making that month the hottest since 1961. In northern Henan, the hottest days on 24 June were in Xuchang with 42.1\u00a0\u00b0C and Dengfeng with 41.6\u00a0\u00b0C recorded since records began. \nAugust.\nBy August, the highest temperatures were recorded across China, while at the same time, less water flowed in the Yangtze, the fewest since 1961. Jiangsu, Hubei and Sichuan provinces had been hit by widespread droughts, local authorities have been ordered to cut water supplies for agricultural, commercial and industrial uses. The drought has already affected more than 800,000 hectares of farmland in six provinces. In August, the weather reached 43.5\u00a0\u00b0C in Gao County, 43.4\u00a0\u00b0C in Jianyang and Zigong, 41\u00a0\u00b0C in Mianyang, 34.9\u00a0\u00b0C in Chongqing at night, and 45\u00a0\u00b0C in Beibei.\nOn 18 August, it was reported that silver iodide was used to form clouds in Anhui and other provinces. From 24 to 26 August, high temperatures in southern Shaanxi, Jianghan, Jianghuai and Jiangnan cooled down from north to south. On 25 August, artificial rainfall was implemented in parts of Sichuan and Chongqing. On 26 August, the high temperature range in the Sichuan Basin and Jiangnan began to decrease. On 28 August, general industrial and commercial electricity consumption in Sichuan was fully restored and the province's electricity shortage situation eased. On 29 August, high temperatures in the Sichuan Basin decreased. Temperatures in most parts of Chongqing dropped below 30\u00b0C. On 30 August, the drought in parts of the Yangtze River Basin eased. On 31 August, high temperatures subsided in most of southern China.\nImpact.\nDue to the drought and increasing power consumption due to the heat, there was a resulting energy crisis of which several factories had to be shut down. The heat wave had also caused affected the country's economy.\nThe drought and persistent heat had also caused more forest fires in China, particularly in Chongqing. Also because of the heat and lack of rain, the level of the Yangtze sharply decreased, and the Three Gorges Dam was opened in order to refill water into that river. \nPoyang Lake, which is located in Jiujiang, Jiangxi, has been reduced to just 25% of its usual size due to extreme weather conditions, causing a major drought.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

That day almost were registered in San Juan, a few tenths of the monthly record for January. On January 12 the city saw 3 heat-related deaths. On January 14, Buenos Aires reached , which became the second highest temperature recorded, surpassing that recorded three days earlier.\nDuring the wave, new electric energy consumption records were set at the national level, above 28,000 MW. On January 11, a massive blackout affected 700,000 users in the north of Buenos Aires and Greater Buenos Aires. To avoid blackouts, the Argentine government asked the industrial sector to reduce energy demand between January 13 and 14, with the aim of being able to provide energy to the home network. In addition, it decreed teleworking for two days for public employees and urged provincial governments to take similar measures. During the most intense week of the heat wave, Argentina imported energy from Brazil and Uruguay.\nIn the midst of the heat wave, and after important fires registered in the previous weeks, especially in Patagonia, the national government declared a fire emergency throughout the country for one year. Fires were recorded in the grasslands and wooded area near Canning and Trist\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez, in Ezeiza, which affected some 130 hectares. In Corrientes, a series of wildfires took place, which consumed around 800,000 hectares, which is equivalent to approximately ten percent of the province.\nUruguay.\nInitially, the Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (INUMET) issued an alert for the heat wave in the north, center and west of the country, but on January 13 it was extended to the entire country. That day, the maximum temperature of was reached in the northern city of Salto, being the hottest January day since 1961. On January 14, Florida reached , the highest temperature ever recorded in the country, matching a 1943 record. 14 of the 19 departments of the country reached a temperature above during the wave.\nThe heat wave affected the generation of wind power due to the lack of wind, which resulted in 50% of the electrical energy having to be generated with the thermal power stations of the National Administration of Power Plants and Electrical Transmissions (UTE). On January 14, a blackout affected around 25,000 electricity network users in the Canelones, Montevideo and Treinta y Tres departments. On that day the country's energy consumption record was broken, reaching 2,139 MW.\nAfter four days of heat wave, the National Directorate of Firefighters reported more than 100 active fires in different parts of the country, such as Paysand\u00fa and Rio Negro. This weather event intensified the drought, which had triggered a declaration of \"agricultural emergency\" in December 2021. In addition, it caused the death of 400,000 chickens, for an estimated value of 1.5 million dollars, due to this, the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries declared the \"poultry emergency\".", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

Vinci performed a moonsault on Hayes, but Williams placed Hayes' foot on the bottom rope to void the pin. In the climax, Vinci powerbombed Williams onto Hayes. Vinci then performed a Spirit Bomb on Williams and looked to do the same to Hayes, but Hayes reversed into a headscissors takedown to retain the title.\nFollowing this, Diamond Mine (Roderick Strong, Damon Kemp, and NXT Tag Team Champions Julius Creed and Brutus Creed) made their appearance to talk about The Creed Brothers' (Brutus and Julius) success in WWE, only for Gallus (Mark Coffey, Joe Coffey, and Wolfgang) to attack them and stand tall to end the segment.\nIn the second match, Roxanne Perez took on Cora Jade. In the closing moments, Jade took a kendo stick, but missed Perez. Perez then took the kendo stick and was about to hit Jade with it, but decided not to. Jade took advantage with a DDT onto the kendo stick to win the match.\nAfterwards, a backstage segment took place where NXT UK Tag Team Champions Josh Briggs and Brooks Jensen were interrupted by Gallus (Joe Coffey, Mark Coffey, and Wolfgang). A brawl between the two teams followed, setting up a match between the two teams for the NXT UK Tag Team Championship for the following week.\nIn the third match, Santos Escobar (accompanied by Elektra Lopez, Cruz Del Toro, and Joaquin Wilde) took on Tony D'Angelo (accompanied by Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo) in a street fight. Lorenzo performed a suicide dive on Wilde and Toro outside the ring. Escobar went for the Arrow From the Depths of Hell dive, but D'Angelo intercepted it with a trash can lid shot. Lopez slapped D'Angelo, and Escobar took him out with an Arrow From the Depths of Hell. Toro distracted D'Angelo, allowing Escobar to roll him up for a nearfall. In the climax, as Lopez gave a crowbar to Escobar, D'Angelo tackled her. D'Angelo followed up with a low blow on Escobar, who recovered and performed a twisting thrust kick on D'Angelo when D'Angelo brought the crowbar in the ring. Escobar retrieved brass knuckles and D'Angelo had a crowbar, and D'Angelo struck Escobar with the crowbar first to win the match. As a result, Escobar and the rest of Legado were gone from NXT.\nIn the penultimate match, Mandy Rose (with Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne) defended the NXT Women's Championship against Zoey Stark. Rose slammed Stark's injured leg into the announce table. Dolin and Jayne tripped up Stark. The referee saw this and ejected them from ringside. Afterwards, Dolin and Jayne were sent backstage by Nikkita Lyons. Throughout the remainder of the match, Rose focused on Stark's injured leg. Stark was able to perform the Tilt-a-whirl GTS on Rose, but couldn't capitalize due to the injury, allowing Rose to roll out of the ring. Rose then took of Stark's knee brace and attempted a Bicycle Knee, but Stark countered into a roll-up for a nearfall. In the closing moments, Rose performed a Bicycle Knee on Stark for a nearfall, after which, Rose put the knee brace on before performing a second Bicycle Knee, with an assist from the knee brace, to retain the title.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Bron Breakker defended the NXT Championship against JD McDonagh. The two started with a chain wrestling sequence that was dominated by Breakker. McDonagh sidestepped a Spear attempt from Breakker, who crashed into the ring post. McDonagh then applied a crossface on Breakker, who made it to the rope to escape. McDonagh performed a Spanish Fly suplex on Breakker and followed up with a brainbuster for a nearfall. In the climax, McDonagh attempted a moonsault, but Breakker avoided it and performed a Spear on McDonagh, who rolled out of the ring to avoid being pinned. When McDonagh returned to the ring, Breakker performed a second Spear on McDonagh, who dared Breakker to perform another. Breakker followed up with a Military Press Powerslam on McDonagh to retain the title. After the match, Breakker was confronted by NXT UK Champion Tyler Bate. The two then held their respective championships in the air as the show ended.\nAftermath.\nNXT Champion Bron Breakker opened the following episode of \"NXT\" to talk about the NXT UK invasion at Heatwave, and being confronted by NXT UK Champion Tyler Bate at the end of the event when Bate interrupted. The two then agreed to a championship unification match for Worlds Collide, where Breakker won to unify the titles.\nJD McDonagh would stay in the NXT Championship picture. On the September 20 episode of \"NXT\", he defeated Tyler Bate to earn a rematch against NXT Champion Bron Breakker at a future date. Afterwards, he was confronted by Breakker and Ilja Dragunov, setting up a triple threat match between the three for the NXT Championship at Halloween Havoc.\nCora Jade and Roxanne Perez would also continue their rivalry. On the October 4 episode of \"NXT\", they were guests on the Waller Effect, which was hosted by Grayson Waller. Waller announced another match between the two at Halloween Havoc as a Weapons Wild match after he spun the wheel with it landing on \"Weapons Wild\".\nGallus (Mark Coffey and Wolfgang) (with Joe Coffey) and Josh Briggs and Brooks Jensen (with Fallon Henley) had their match for the NXT UK Tag Team Championship on the following episode of \"NXT\". The ending came when Lash Legend attacked Henley, leading to Pretty Deadly (Kit Wilson and Elton Prince) brawling with Briggs and Jensen outside the ring. As a result, Gallus won via countout, but Briggs and Jensen retained. The following week, Briggs and Jensen teamed with Henley to take on Wilson, Prince, and Legend in a winning effort after interference from Mark and Wolfgang. Later that night, after Mark, Joe, and Wolfgang defeated Damon Kemp and NXT Tag Team Champions The Creed Brothers (Brutus Creed and Julius Creed), a brawl between the two teams broke out, and Pretty Deadly and Briggs and Jensen got involved in the brawl, leading to a fatal four-way tag team elimination match between the four teams to unify the NXT and NXT UK Tag Team Championships being made official for Worlds Collide.\nThis ended up being Giovanni Vinci's final NXT appearance, as at Clash at the Castle on September 3, Vinci made his main roster debut, where he and Ludwig Kaiser accompanied Gunther (who defended his Intercontinental Championship against Sheamus at the event), reforming Imperium in the process.\nOn the following episode of \"NXT\", Santos Escobar picked up the rest of Legado Del Fantasma (Cruz Del Toro, Joaquin Wilde, and Elektra Lopez) and drove away from the Performance Center with them, signaling the end of their time in NXT. They were then promoted to the main roster on SmackDown and debuted on the October 7 episode of \"SmackDown\" with a returning Zelina Vega replacing Lopez, who stayed in NXT.", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

Temperature above average hit central and eastern Europe, with the highest anomalies centered on Scandinavia and parts of western Russia, due to the heat dome effect. Anticyclone conditions over Russia resemble those in the 2010 heat waves, with parts of Siberia were higher than normal. The shores of the Barents Sea saw hotter temperatures than beaches in Italy and southern France, around for several days.\nIn June 2021, Kazakhstan faced a record-breaking increase in temperatures in western parts of the country, specifically the Kyzylorda, Mangystau, and Turkistan regions. As a result, the Kazakh meteorological service Kazhydromet forecasted that an extreme drought would take place. By 7 July, the temperatures reached up to . Prior to the announcement of increased temperatures, photos from the Mangystau Region emerged on social media which showed emaciated horses on a verge of dying. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the cause for situation was due to lack of pasturage in the area as a result of several climatic conditions, and that measures would be implemented to prevent the further casualties of livestock. The Khabar Agency on 16 June 2021 reported that approximately 2,000 livestock had died with Kazakh lawmakers calling for a state of emergency to be implemented in the Mangystau and Kyzylorda regions, citing the problems in farmers whom were unwilling to feed the cattle due to inflated costs for animal feed. In July 2021, due to worsening situation, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev called on Agriculture Minister Saparhan Omarov to resign, citing his failure to provide assistance to struggling farmers. On 13 July, a state of emergency was introduced in the Aral District in an attempt to solve the shortage of feed. In a visit to Mangystau Region, Acting Agriculture Minister Erbol Qara\u015fukeev pledged that 1.9 billion \u20b8 would allocated in order to reduce the costs of livestock feed and that a ban on its exports would be placed as well.\nNorth America.\nAn extreme heat wave affected much of Western North America from late June through mid-July 2021. Rapid attribution analysis found this was a 1000-year weather event, made 150 times more likely by climate change. The heat wave affected Northern California, Idaho, Western Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in the United States, as well as British Columbia, and, in its latter phase, Alberta, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, and Yukon, all in Canada. The heat wave appeared due to an exceptionally strong ridge centered over the area, whose strength was linked to the effects of climate change. It resulted in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in the region, including the highest temperature ever measured in Canada at . The exact death toll is unknown, and growing. On July\u00a06, preliminary statistics released by the British Columbia Coroner Service indicated 610 more sudden deaths than usual occurred in the province and Alberta logged 66 excess deaths in the week of the heat wave; the Chief Coroner of British Columbia later said that in the week between June\u00a025 to July\u00a01, 569 deaths were confirmed to have happened due to heat-related causes. Confirmed deaths in the United States include at least 116\u00a0in Oregon (of which 72\u00a0are in Multnomah County, which includes Portland), at least 112\u00a0in Washington and one death in Idaho; though an analysis by \"The New York Times\" suggests that around 600 excess deaths occurred on the week the heat wave passed through Washington and Oregon.\nJuly.\nIn July, a heat wave in Europe led to record-breaking temperatures in the UK and Ireland.\nAugust.\nA heat wave impacted North America in August 2021. The heat wave was the second of the summer for the Pacific Northwest. A state of emergency was declared in Oregon.

{"id": "61908255", "revid": "35560722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61908255", "title": "Marine heatwave", "text": "A marine heatwave (abbreviated as MHW) is a period of abnormally high ocean temperatures relative to the average seasonal temperature in a particular marine region. Marine heatwaves are caused by a variety of factors, including shorter term weather phenomena such as fronts, intraseasonal, annual, or decadal modes like El Ni\u00f1o events, and longer term changes like climate change. Marine heatwaves can lead to severe biodiversity changes such as coral bleaching, sea star wasting disease, harmful algal blooms, and mass mortality of benthic communities. Unlike heatwaves on land, marine heatwaves can extend for millions of square kilometers, persist for weeks to months or even years, and occur at subsurface levels.\nMajor marine heatwave events such as Great Barrier Reef 2002, Mediterranean 2003, Northwest Atlantic 2012, and Northeast Pacific 2013-2016 have had drastic and long-term impacts on the oceanographic and biological conditions in those areas.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report stated in 2022 that \"marine heatwaves are more frequent [...], more intense and longer [...] since the 1980s, and since at least 2006 very likely attributable to anthropogenic climate change\". This confirms earlier findings, for example in the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate from 2019 which stated that it is \"virtually certain\" that the global ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat in our climate systems, the rate of ocean warming has doubled, and marine heatwave events have doubled in frequency since 1982. \nWhile marine heat waves have been studied at the sea surface for more than a decade, a 2023 paper published in the scientific journal Nature Communications details how a team led by NOAA researchers showed for the first time that these extreme events also occur at the sea floor.\nDefinition.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines \"marine heatwave\" as follows: \"A period during which water temperature is abnormally warm for the time of the year relative to historical temperatures, with that extreme warmth persisting for days to months. The phenomenon can manifest in any place in the ocean and at scales of up to thousands of kilometres.\"\nAnother publication defined it as follows: an anomalously warm event is a marine heatwave \"if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period\".\nCategories.\nThe quantitative and qualitative categorization of marine heatwaves establishes a naming system, typology, and characteristics for marine heatwave events. The naming system is applied by location and year: for example Mediterranean 2003. This allows researchers to compare the drivers and characteristics of each event, geographical and historical trends of marine heatwaves, and easily communicate marine heatwave events as they occur in real-time. \nThe categorization system is on a scale from 1 to 4. Category 1 is a moderate event, Category 2 is a strong event, Category 3 is a severe event, and Category 4 is an extreme event. The category applied to each event in real-time is defined primarily by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), but over time it comes to include typology and characteristics. \nThe types of marine heatwaves are symmetric, slow onset, fast onset, low intensity, and high intensity. Marine heatwave events may have multiple categories such as slow onset, high intensity. The characteristics of marine heatwave events include duration, intensity (max, average, cumulative), onset rate, decline rate, region, and frequency.\nDrivers.\nThe drivers for marine heatwave events can be broken into local processes, teleconnection processes, and regional climate patterns. Two quantitative measurements of these drivers have been proposed to identify marine heatwave, mean sea surface temperature and sea surface temperature variability. \nAt the local level marine heatwave events are dominated by ocean advection, air-sea fluxes, thermocline stability, and wind stress. Teleconnection processes refer to climate and weather patterns that connect geographically distant areas. For marine heatwave, the teleconnection process that play a dominant role are atmospheric blocking/subsidence, jet-stream position, oceanic kelvin waves, regional wind stress, warm surface air temperature, and seasonal climate oscillations. These processes contribute to regional warming trends that disproportionately effect Western boundary currents. \nRegional climate patterns such as interdecadal oscillations like El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have contributed to marine heatwave events such as \"The Blob\" in the Northeastern Pacific. \nDrivers that operate on the scale of biogeographical realms or the Earth as a whole are Decadal oscillations, like Pacific Decadal Oscillations (PDO), and anthropogenic ocean warming due to climate change.\nOcean areas of carbon sinks in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres and carbon outgassing areas in upwelling regions of the tropical Pacific have been identified as places where persistent marine heatwaves occur; the air-sea gas exchange is being studied in these areas.\nClimate change as an additional driver.\nScientists predict that the frequency, duration, scale (or area) and intensity of marine heatwaves will continue to increase. This is because sea surface temperatures will continue to increase with global warming, and therefore the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves will also increase. The extent of ocean warming depends on emission scenarios, and thus humans' climate change mitigation efforts. Simply put, the more greenhouse gas emissions (or the less mitigation), the more the sea surface temperature will rise. Scientists have calculated this as follows: there would be a relatively small (but still significant) increase of 0.86\u00b0C in the average sea surface temperature for the low emissions scenario (called SSP1-2.6). But for the high emissions scenario (called SSP5-8.5) the temperature increase would be as high as 2.89\u00b0C.\nThe prediction for marine heatwaves is that they may become \"four times more frequent in 2081\u20132100 compared to 1995\u20132014\" under the lower emissions scenario, or eight times more frequent under the higher emissions scenario. The emissions scenarios are called SSP for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. A mathematical model called CMIP6 is used for these predictions. The predictions are for the average of the future period (years 2081 to 2100) compared to the average of the past period (years 1995 to 2014). \nMany species already experience these temperature shifts during the course of marine heatwave events. There are many increased risk factors and health impacts to coastal and inland communities as global average temperature and extreme heat events increase.\nList of events.\nSea surface temperatures have been recorded since 1904 in Port Erin, UK and measurements continue through global organizations such as NOAA, NASA, and many more. Events can be identified from 1925 till present day. The list below is not a complete representation of all marine heatwave events that have ever been recorded.\nImpacts.\nOn marine ecosystems.\nChanges in the thermal environment of terrestrial and marine organisms can have drastic effects on their health and well-being. marine heatwave events have been shown to increase habitat degradation, change species range dispersion, complicate management of environmentally and economically important fisheries, contribute to mass mortalities of species, and in general reshape ecosystems.\nHabitat degradation occurs through alterations of the thermal environment and subsequent restructuring and sometimes complete loss of biogenic habitats such as seagrass beds, corals, and kelp forests. These habitats contain a significant proportion of the oceans biodiversity. Changes in ocean current systems and local thermal environments have shifted many tropical species' range northward while temperate species have lost their southern limits. Large range shifts along with outbreaks of toxic algal blooms has impacted many species across taxa. Management of these affected species becomes increasingly difficult as they migrate across management boundaries and the food web dynamics shift.\nIncreases in sea surface temperature have been linked to a decline in species abundance such as the mass mortality of 25 benthic species in the Mediterranean in 2003, the Sea Star Wasting Disease, and coral bleaching events. Climate change-related exceptional marine heatwaves in the Mediterranean Sea during 2015\u20132019 resulted in widespread mass sealife die-offs in five consecutive years. The impact of more frequent and prolonged marine heatwave events will have drastic implications for the distribution of species.\nOn weather patterns.\nResearch on how marine heatwaves influence atmospheric conditions is emerging. Marine heatwaves in the tropical Indian Ocean are found to result in dry conditions over the central Indian subcontinent. At the same time, there is an increase in rainfall over south peninsular India in response to marine heatwaves in the northern Bay of Bengal. These changes are in response to the modulation of the monsoon winds by the marine heatwaves.\nOptions for reducing impacts.\nTo address the root cause of more frequent and more intense marine heatwaves, climate change mitigation methods are needed to curb the increase in global temperature and in ocean temperatures.\nBetter forecasts of marine heatwaves and improved monitoring can also help to reduce impacts of these heatwaves.", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

Most of the dead were poor and elderly and a majority of deaths occurred in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. In the districts that were impacted most, the heat was so severe that ponds and rivers evaporated and in those same districts birds had fallen from the sky and animals were collapsing from the intense heat. \nIt is said by officials to be the worst heat wave in four years. The relief commissioner of Andhra Pradesh, Rosaiah, said that the maximum number of 172 deaths related to heat took place in the East Godavari district. There were also 166 deaths in Prakasam and 144 deaths in West Godavari.\nUnusually high temperatures were detected across India during April of the year 2002. In addition, this heat wave over northern zones of India lasted from the middle of April to the third week in May, thus, causing these fatalities. On May 10 the highest temperature recorded in the region of Gannavaram (Vijayawada) was 49 oC (120 oF). According to the BBC News, \"Heatwaves are defined as periods of abnormally high temperatures and usually occur between March and June in India. May is the country's hottest month, with an average maximum temperature of 41 oC (104 oF) in Delhi. Longer, more severe heatwaves are becoming increasingly frequent globally. Intense heat can cause cramps, exhaustion and heat stroke. Thousands of people have died across India during heatwaves in 2002 and 2003.\" The heatwaves also affected the northern states of Punjab, and Haryana. In Orissa, 100 people suffered from heat-related sickness.\nBackground and details of the 2002 Indian heat wave.\nDefinition of Heat Wave.\nHeatwave as a hazard causing disaster scenario is little more than the physical phenomenon of high heat conditions and is characterized as a complex of hydro-climatic risks coupled with social, occupational, and public health risks. A Heat Wave is a period of abnormally high temperatures, more than the normal maximum temperature that occurs during the summer season in the North-Western parts of India.\n2002 Indian Heat Wave.\nOne of the worst heat waves so far swept through India in May 2002. This was caused by an extreme drought triggered by the El Ni\u00f1o effect. The fierce heatwave killed more than 1,000 people in the country. Elderly people account for most of the deaths, unable to bear temperatures that hit 50 oC (122 oF) in parts of the southern Andhra Pradesh state during the week of May 9\u201315. In some areas, temperatures were so extreme that many tin-roofed homes turned into ovens, water catchments dried up and animals collapsed from the heat. Heatwave in 2002 led not only to a very high mortality rate, but also to the high morbidity of many heat-related diseases and caused a fatal blow to the local agriculture and economy.\nHeatwave events in India during the past 20 years.\nHeat health impacts in India are serious. Estimates suggest that there have been over 22,000 heat-related fatalities in India since 1992. Due to the El Ni\u00f1o effect, 2015 is considered the hottest year ever, the country witnessed the fifth deadliest heatwave in history. The other nine warmest years on record are 2009, 2010, 2003, 2002, 2014, 1998, 2006 and 2007. In addition to the vulnerable populations identified above, the poor may be differentially impacted on account of gaps in health services, housing, and basic amenities.\nHeatwave developing trend.\nIndia Meteorological Department report says that heat waves (40oC+ temperatures) are recurring more frequently and with greater intensity every year in India due to climate change and global warming. Therefore, harder works should not only be taken on alleviating the negative impact of the heatwave, but also the root cause problem of climate warming.\nImpact of heatwave as a disaster.\nConsequences of Indian heatwave so far.\nPhysical impacts.\nThe 2002 Indian heat waves was a record-breaking event, which can be considered as a wake-up call and a shock to the Indian order and development. 330 million people were impacted by this heatwave that took about 1030 lives in parts of the southern Andhra Pradesh state during the second week of May 2002, which elderly and poor people account for most of the deaths due to dehydration and heatstroke. People were unable to bear temperatures that hit 50 oC (122 oFahrenheit) as well as the unusual high night-time temperatures.\nGeographical impacts.\nThe heatwave forced the early-season rice (Basmati) in the milk-ripe stage to ripening, reducing the thousand-grain mass as well as the yield due to transpiration. High-temperature damage caused detrimental impacts to the growth of crops as water supply and demand were out of balance, resulting in wilting and bud drop. In addition, such extreme events also greatly increased the water and electricity consumption of urban residents in India.\nCauses of Increasing Heat Wave Incidents.\nGeographical.\nHeatwave occur mostly over an interior plain area when dry and warmer air is transported in a region with clear skies, and generally develop over Northwest India and spread gradually eastwards &amp; southwards. The direct cause of the heatwave was the anticyclones or high-pressure ridges occurred in the atmosphere, which leads to a dry climate and a risen temperature without evaporating moisture.\nClimate factors.\nAccording to case studies carried out by German climatologist Stefan Rahmstorf, there is a causal relationship between heatwave and global warming. Nonetheless, following the effects posed by the heatwave, the WHO, alongside other healthcare organizations, are coming up with strategies to bring back the world into operations.\nResponse &amp; Adjustments.\nLocal response.\nP Tulsi Rani, special commissioner for disaster management in the state said: \"The state government has taken up education programs through television and other media to tell people not to venture into the outside without a cap.\" In addition, the Andhra Pradesh government has advised people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water until cooler weather arrives. The local authorities arranged for drinking water supply points, oral rehydration salts and intravenous fluids in public places such as railway and bus stations, and many emergency medical camps have been set up.\nInternational response.\nNeighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan are hot as well, but India to be suffering far worse. Therefore, following the example of India's measures in this regard, they were able to face the threat of a heatwave.\nHealth Impacts of Heat Waves.\nHeatwave-induced diseases and mortality.\nDiseases that can be identified as a direct result of prolonged exposure to high ambient temperatures are heat exhaustion, heat syncope, and heatstroke. During heat waves, there is a significant increase in total daily mortality in all cities. Natural, respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular mortality rates increased significantly under the influence of the heatwave. The health status of people with chronic respiratory diseases deteriorates rapidly during periods of high temperatures.\nUrban-rural differences in health risks.\nHuman mortality is influenced by ambient meteorological conditions and levels of atmospheric pollutants. Stagnant atmospheric conditions, common during heatwaves, can trap pollutants in urban areas, exacerbating the negative effects of heatwaves. As heat waves intensify and prolong under climate change, the health risks for urban residents will be significantly higher than for rural residents. Heatwaves not only raise ambient temperatures, but also exacerbate temperature differences between urban and rural areas.\nSeasonal differences in health risks.\nMore frequent heatwaves in late spring and early summer may affect short-term human adaptation. Heatwaves in early summer now have a greater impact on heat-related morbidity and mortality than later in the same season. This is attributed to the effects of short-term adaptation to thermal conditions through physiological and behavioral adaptations.\nAge differences in health risks.\nOlder people are more likely to suffer from heatstroke than younger people due to dysfunctional thermoregulatory mechanisms, chronic dehydration, medication, and diseases involving the thermoregulatory system. If left untreated, heatstroke can fail to reduce body temperature rapidly, which is fatal, and survivors may suffer long-term disability.\nShorter- and longer-term impacts and other consequences.\nShorter-term impacts and consequences.\nEconomy.\nExtreme high temperatures hit Indian tourism by reducing the number of tourists, and then affected the social economy of this period. Similarly, the chaotic social conditions and low agricultural production will inevitably cause specific economic losses.\nAgricultural.\nAs a populous country, Indian dwellers depend on basic agriculture for food and livelihood. Kharif crops, one of the main foods in India, are sown in May to June, any extreme temperature is bound to affect productivity. Therefore, in May 2002, rice, one of the Indian staple foods, declines due to lower production of related grain yield. Consequently, it caused more hunger and death problems.\nlivelihood.\nHigh temperatures prevented outdoor workers from working outdoors, such as traffic police and cleaners. Especially, for a state (India) where the majority of individuals might be working in unorganized and informal sectors, this condition compromised the income source of the vulnerable population.\nLonger-term impacts and consequences.\nEconomy.\nPotential climate impacts like sea-level rise, changes in the monsoon, and drought may lead to food production cuts, private and public property loss, and infrastructure damage. All of these impacts set back general socio-economic development.\nGeo-anthropology.\nStudies have proved that the earth's latitude has a great impact on human destiny. In some way, low-dimensional tropical countries are relatively poorer and more vulnerable to diseases due to the higher temperature. Meanwhile, as the harm of the heatwave increases, so will the vulnerability of India's future population, especially in Indo-Gangetic plains.\nClimate.\nIn the aspect of vulnerability to climate change, India is one of the most significant countries in the world. The frequency and intensity of heatwave events in India are projected to increase in the future. Most models indicate that the Indian summer monsoons will change disorderly with a warming climate. This means that the time of the monsoon that relieves the heat is more uncertain and that the consequences of the heat waves may be more unpredictable.\nLessons learned from the disaster.\nImproving adaptability to thermal environments.\nIn terms of architecture, it is possible to construct high ceilings and spacious but lowered verandas to provide more shade. With respect to clothing, wear more light and loose clothing made of cotton and use a hat to protect yourself from direct sunlight. And about lifestyle, try to choose to exercise and work hard in the early morning or late afternoon, and during the summer months a hearty breakfast and a light lunch should be part of our lives.\nConcretization and diversification of measures.\nTo protect public health, heat-related policies are increasingly being adopted by Indian authorities, such as Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan, launched in 2013, which is an acclaimed and successful policy response in India and beyond.\nIt's effective to hold fun challenges, such as a global competition was launched in 2021 - The Million Cool Roofs Challenge, where the top of a building is coated with solar reflective paint and covered with white tiles or films to help combat climate change. The team that demonstrates the best sustainable and transferable model can be awarded US$1 million.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

July was the warmest ever month on record in the north-west.\nEvents.\nThe July heat wave started after a week, when H\u00e4rsn\u00e4s in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County recorded after hot continental air came into the south of the country. The southerly coastal areas recorded particularly warm nights, with Karlskrona recording a night minimum of on 9 July. The heat remained stabled and quite normal until the second half of the month, when heat warnings were released by the Meteorological Office. The heat affected all of Sweden, but was particularly abnormally hot in the north. Tropical nights were recorded in the coastal north and by the Atlantic in the south on 22 and 23 July Ume\u00e5 had its warmest temperature since 1882 with . The temperature record of nearby islet Holm\u00f6n was beaten by more than three degrees and topped on an outlying island north of 63 degrees latitude. Several thunderstorms struck the country in some areas at this time, with the precipitation being unevenly distributed. fell on the same day in Motala, whilst nearby Link\u00f6ping only had of rainfall in all of July \u2013 akin to mediterranean climates. The highest figure was on the same day in Emmaboda in the southern inland areas.\nThe temperatures started to rise to new exceptional levels the final week of July and first week of August. Small islets Stor\u00f6n and R\u00f6dkallen on the central Norrland coast had a night minimum at on 26 July. The intense sunshine and warm winds brought temperatures to in H\u00f6kmarksberget in Skellefte\u00e5 Municipality the following day, with even a marine station (Bjur\u00f6klubb) going above for the first time ever. As seen in this official picture, temperatures were a lot warmer than usual with daily means being above in the most southerly areas, with temperatures approaching such means even far north. Even gloomy mountain areas such as \u00d6stersund and Storlien had warm months. Although the temperatures in the mountain ranges topped on average, more significant though was that both locations significantly bettered the July sunshine records.\nIn August the heat wave in the far north got somewhat tempered, but for the first week the heatwave got new proportions in the southern and central parts of Sweden. After a few relatively calm days around a high-pressure system originating in the Baltic states came into the eastern parts of the country on 3 August, ensuring new nationwide high temperatures for the heatwave, although not matching the historic all-time highs. H\u00e4rsn\u00e4s once again tied for warmest in the country with , matching the values from Renbergsvattnet. 4 August was the hottest day of the year and for a few years before when far inland town Falun recorded , Other areas got affected by thunderstorms moderating temperatures the same day, but \u00d6rebro recorded \u2013 the highest temperature in that city for decades, as well as Uppsala setting a new August record with . The highest overnight low was reached on 3 August on the uninhabited isolated island of Gotska Sand\u00f6n with a mere 0.1\u00a0\u00b0C below the nationwide all-time record for warmest low.\nFollowing this event, the heat cooled off and August in general was quite normal in terms of temperatures, with plentiful of precipitation. The warm waters surrounding Sweden during the autumn still led to thunderstorms happening as late as early November, something that is highly unusual.\nMilestones.\nSeveral heat records were broken and the summer was unusually warm by such northerly marine standards. Apart from in neighbouring countries the heatwave was very much localised, and average temperatures were somewhat neutered by cooler spells interrupting the various intense bursts of heat, as well as the cool nights in Sweden that bring average temperatures down. In a Swedish context this was still a remarkable event, in particular the extremely warm temperatures far north. Small village Kvikkjokk north of the Arctic Circle had a July average high of and Lule\u00e5 had a daily mean of in a coastal location north of the 65th parallel. Sweden's second city Gothenburg tied for the warmest July month on record with a high of , a low of and a resulting mean of . Gothenburg's mean was the warmest in the country, but the warmest high mean was in Falun. The all-time record of the mean for Link\u00f6ping a 100 years earlier did however stand. A July average low of was measured at M\u00e5sesk\u00e4r off the west coast, where temperatures never fell below all month.\nThe warm and dry local weather also contributed to intense wildfires in V\u00e4stmanland County in early August that took several weeks to get under proper control.\nWith the heat wave as a contributing factor along with the following mild autumn, 2014 was the warmest year on record in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6 \u2013 the three largest cities in the country. The yearly mean of in Falsterbo was also the highest on record for the official stations mentioned every month in SMHI's data report. Lund recorded an average year high of . Among other unusual consequences of the heat wave was that Kiruna had a yearly mean of just above the freezing point, and Lule\u00e5's mean topping for the first time.\nRegions.\nSk\u00e5ne.\nSkan\u00f6r med Falsterbo set a new Swedish record for warmest yearly mean with . Its marine features rendered less severe daytime heat during the heat wave, but rather very warm nights. Daily July means went above , but the temperature record and individual monthly record both stood, with Falsterbo only once recording in its recorded history (as of 2016). In spite of the hypermarine features of the climate Falsterbo recorded 20 days above during the summer. In the wake of the heat wave Falsterbo had an October average low of the very mild .\nLund in Sk\u00e5ne had its warmest year on record, but its extremely warm July still did not match its 2006 record for the warmest month. Lund recorded 33 days with temperatures above . Its July mean of was also the warmest in the country, due to the very warm nights by Swedish standards, averaging around . Unlike areas further north, Lund did not experience a summer drought.\nEastern G\u00f6taland.\nNorrk\u00f6ping and the surrounding coastline through V\u00e4stervik to the south Nyk\u00f6ping to the east had a very warm summer in spite of the near-coastal location. Norrk\u00f6ping had a yearly mean of , a new all-time record. Although the year was record warm, July did not beat the 1994 records, but it was still far warmer than a normal year. In total, 32 days of the year reached in Norrk\u00f6ping.\nSvealand.\nFalun in Dalarna saw the warmest temperature of the year in the country with in early August. Its July was also the hottest in Sweden during daytime. July was so dry that it could easily be compared to mediterranean climates. August compensated for that with heavy rainfall.\n\u00d6rebro, (namesake county) had a very warm year with uneven precipitation patterns, with a summer drought and heavy rainfall in many other parts of the year.\nNorthern Norrland.\nLule\u00e5 (Norrbotten), recorded the warmest month in Northern Norrland since 1925 with a July mean of . Considering the airport being in a rural setting, the urban area may well have surpassed Haparanda's 1925 reading. In spite of the high means a mere 14 days above was recorded in Lule\u00e5. The warm temperatures both in July means and yearly means were due to the mild summer nights by the coastline.\nLycksele saw a record warm summer with an extremely hot July considering its northerly latitude with summer highs approaching . As many as 31 days reached or went above .\nReferences.\n ", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The first phase of the global heatwaves was caused by a moderate El Ni\u00f1o event, which lasted from June 2009 to May 2010. The first phase lasted only from April 2010 to June 2010, and caused only moderate above average temperatures in the areas affected. But it also set new record high temperatures for most of the area affected, in the Northern Hemisphere. The second phase (the main, and most devastating phase) was caused by a very strong La Ni\u00f1a event, which lasted from June 2010 to June 2011. According to meteorologists, the 2010\u201311 La Ni\u00f1a event was one of the strongest La Ni\u00f1a events ever observed. That same La Ni\u00f1a event also had devastating effects in the Eastern states of Australia. The second phase lasted from June 2010 to October 2010, caused severe heat waves, and multiple record-breaking temperatures. The heatwaves began in April 2010, when strong anticyclones began to develop, over most of the affected regions, in the Northern Hemisphere. The heatwaves ended in October 2010, when the powerful anticyclones over most of the affected areas dissipated.\nThe heat wave during the summer of 2010 was at its worst in June, over the Eastern United States, Middle East, Eastern Europe and European Russia, and over Northeastern China and southeastern Russia. June 2010 marked the fourth consecutive warmest month on record globally, at 0.66\u00a0\u00b0C (1.22\u00a0\u00b0F) above average, while the period April\u2013June was the warmest ever recorded for land areas in the Northern Hemisphere, at 1.25\u00a0\u00b0C (2.25\u00a0\u00b0F) above average. The previous record for the global average temperature in June was set in 2005 at 0.66\u00a0\u00b0C (1.19\u00a0\u00b0F), and the previous warm record for April\u2013June over Northern Hemisphere land areas was 1.16\u00a0\u00b0C (2.09\u00a0\u00b0F), set in 2007. The strongest of the anticyclones, the one situated over Siberia, registered a maximum high pressure of 1040 millibars. The weather caused forest fires in China, where three in a team of 300 died fighting a fire that broke out in the Binchuan County of Dali, as Yunnan suffered the worst drought in 60 years by February 17. A major drought was reported across the Sahel as early as January. In August, a section of the Petermann Glacier tongue connecting northern Greenland, the Nares Strait and the Arctic Ocean broke off, the biggest ice shelf in the Arctic to detach in 48 years. By the time the heatwaves had ended in late October 2010, about $500 billion (2011 USD) of damage was done, in the Northern Hemisphere alone.\nMore than 55,000\u00a0people died during the heat wave in Russia. The World Meteorological Organization stated that the heat waves, droughts and flooding events fit with predictions based on global warming for the 21st century, include those based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2007 4th Assessment Report. Some climatologists argue that these weather events would not have happened if the atmospheric carbon dioxide was at pre-industrial levels.\nEvents.\nEurope.\nEurope in general.\nA heat wave hit Eastern Europe as exceptionally strong jet stream winds blew in from the Sahara across the Balkans and into both Poland and Ukraine on June 10. The Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW) warned of temperatures in Poland exceeding for the next 5 days, followed by heavy winds, rain storms, thunderstorms and possible flooding especially in the north-west of the country and neighbouring parts of Germany.\nThe period between June 13 and 19 saw a low pressure zone move south eastwards taking a shallow pool of cooler air south eastwards across from the North Atlantic into Ireland and most of the United Kingdom.\nAs the floods eased in Central Europe and the Balkans, apart from those in Romania, temperatures began to climb across Western Europe, including Frankfurt am Main in Germany and the United Kingdom on June 30.\nOn July 2, Brussels saw its hottest day since 1976 and France, Germany and the Spanish resort Benidorm experienced record temperatures.

Heavy thunderstorms hit the High Swiss Alps, accompanied by heavy snow in some places.\nOn July 6, 3 low pressure areas moved towards and settled near the Black Sea after a week a high pressure in the region's jet stream far northward in its trek through Europe. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's GFS numerical model predicted the same weather for the following week.\nA meteorological synoptic pressure corridor ran from Germany and Poland east and northeast to western and north western Russia causing temperatures that were 4\u00a0\u00b0C, 8\u00a0\u00b0C and in one case 10\u00a0\u00b0C above the seasonal norm. Cities from Berlin and Warsaw to Kyiv, Minsk, Moscow and St. Petersburg may well reach the 33\u00a0\u00b0C to 35\u00a0\u00b0C range.\nBerlin and Warsaw recorded temperatures of 33\u00a0\u00b0C, while highs of nearly 34\u00a0\u00b0C in Moscow broke records.

The Swiss Health Office offered the public safety advice. The ozone level rose badly and was more than twice the permitted level at 257 microgrammes per cubic metre in Lugano on Friday, and things were in a generally bad condition across the Swiss Alps as a whole. Extreme heat and ozone levels were also harming tourists at the Gotthard Road Tunnel on the 8th and 9th.\nThe Swiss Ornithological Institute, based in Sempach, said young swifts were stifling to death and others were jumping out before they could fly properly, as temperatures reached in their under the roof nests.

On the popular North Sea island of Helgoland, the temperature was only 20.5 degrees. In Berlin, the highest temperature was recorded at as 3 more non-air conditioned local passengers trains had to be evacuated due to overheating of the interior passenger compartments, leading to passengers getting heat stroke, Deutsche Welle reported. Hans-Dieter Muehlenberg, chief of a local rescue squad in Berlin told the German news agency DAPD he had found the temperature in a local train had reached and that nine people had to be hospitalized for dehydration. Later on, official reports from the rescue squad denied that 9 people reported dead had died and that the air conditioning systems fail to cool the trains in temperatures over . Deutsche Bahn paid 500 Euros for the heat victims without a doctors note. According to the German Meteorological Service (DWD), the soaring temperatures were set to last for a week.\nBelgian authorities were worried about water shortages as a result of both the hot weather and lack of rain. The water authorities in the eastern town of Bullange warned that several water sources have dried up. The Belgian interior ministry said that three other communes in the southeast of the country have also appealed for emergency water supplies.\nThe Czech Republic exceeded for the third day running, as doctors in the Czech Republic issued safety advice according to the Voice of Russia. High temperatures were also occurring in parts of Slovakia and around the Black Sea.\nThe heat wave begins to end as heavy rain hits the Swansea-Port Talbot region of Wales, Devon, central Ireland and parts of eastern France.\nBoth Alpine and North Sea thunderstorms sweep across southeast and northwest Germany respectively. Heavy rainfall is also reported in parts of the Netherlands, Ireland, Normandy and the English Midlands on the 13th. Both melting glaciers and heavy rain in the Alps caused avalanches and flash floods in Switzerland. A nationwide near-record temperature of was recorded in parts of Sion in Valais Canton, south west Switzerland on the 13th.\nThunderstorms hit the English Midlands, Oxfordshire, Ireland, Northern Ireland and parts of the Swiss Alps. The heat wave ended in the British Isles and Northwest Europe on the 14th.\nJuly 16 saw the heat wave peak in intensity throughout Italy, the Vatican, San Marino and Malta.

The hottest recorded temperature in Kazakhstan was , which set a new record, as the hottest temperature ever recorded in that country.\nRussia.\nLater extreme event attribution studies concluded that the heatwave in Russia was made much more likely by climate change but that it made little difference to the intensity.\nThe abnormal heat wave was also experienced in Russia, causing fires throughout the country, the worst drought in nearly 40 years, and the loss of at least 9 million hectares of crops. According to head of Rosgidromet state weather agency Alexander Frolov, there was no such heat during the last 1000 years. The highest temperature ever recorded in Russia was , set on 11 July, in Yashkul, Kalmykia, beating the previous record of set on 6 August 1940, also in Kalmykia.\nThe initial soil drying in June and early July is thought to be a major cause of the exceptional heat level after mid-July.\nOn 25 June a temperature record was set in the Asian portion of Russia, at Belogorsk, at a reading of .

In one case at least 63 people died in one day alone. An emergency ministry spokesman told the Ria Novosti news agency that 285 people had died in Russia's waterways. The 285 deaths occurred mainly due to the fact that they had swum in dangerous locations, they were ill-prepared and/or were dangerously drunk. A Bulgarian tourist also fell ill with sun stroke in Ryazan. Moscow was hit by a minor cholera outbreak on 5 July.\nHighs of nearly in Moscow broke records. Earlier in June, Minsk hit and Kyiv's temperature soared to . Saint Petersburg, however, has yet to see the 30-degree mark.\nTemperatures hit a record-breaking highs of 37\u00a0\u00b0C in several regions in the Central Federal District on 5 July.

The Siberian record was set at 35.3\u00a0\u00b0C in the Yakutia, which was also seeing its provincial temperature rise.\nRussia's weather forecasts said it was the most prolonged heat wave since 1981. Moscow's City Hall sent out water tankers to put water on the roads to prevent the tarmac from melting.\nMoscow's temperature was on 7 July. At the same time the heat in Yakutia recorded 35.3\u00a0\u00b0C. A record-breaking heat wave in late June saw temperatures reach 37\u00a0\u00b0C in several central Russian regions, sparking forest fires and causing heat stroke in many people in various parts of the Central Federal District and Ural Federal District.\nOn the 11 and 12 July, many people across Europe fell ill due to heat stroke caused by the very high temperatures reached on these two days.\nA total of 14 regions suddenly overheated on the 11 to 13 July, including Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Orenburg, Saratov, Samara Oblast as the heat cooked the partly drought hit Volga Federal District. Nineteen of Russia's 83 regions declared a state of emergency after crop failure caused by the heat-induced drought.

It caused the deaths of about 2,000 people from dehydration and heat stroke, mostly in Sindh province and its capital city, Karachi. The heat wave also claimed the lives of zoo animals and countless agricultural livestock. The event followed a separate heat wave in neighboring India that killed 2,500 people in May 2015.\nRecorded temperatures.\nExtreme temperatures started to grip Pakistan's southern areas on 18 June 2015, and peaked on 20 June:\nKarachi recorded its highest temperatures since 1979. By 24 June 2015, the temperature and death toll began to abate; the maximum temperature in Karachi was , and officials reported 58 deaths compared to 300 the previous day.\nContributory factors.\nAsif Shuja, the former director general of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, claimed the heat wave was a symptom of global climate change, aggravated by deforestation, expansion of asphalt superhighways, and rapid urbanisation. He maintained that \"there has been a rise in the Earth's average temperature from to over the last 100 years, due to which we are experiencing such extreme weather conditions both in summers and winters.\" Shuja went on to say that the lack of sophisticated weather prediction technology in Pakistan contributed to the casualties of the heat wave.\nMoreover, widespread failures of the electrical grid left many locations without working air-conditioners, fans, or water pumps, adding further to the death toll.

The two Ministers visited Karachi's Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in the wake of deaths due to the severe heat wave. Speaking to the media during their visit, Baloch said that the K-Electric was being investigated for load shedding. Baloch held the K-Electric, KW&amp;SB and Sindh government responsible for the increase in heat wave mortality in Karachi. The power regulator NEPRA reported that K-Electric was not generating electricity according to its generation capacity.\nThe heat wave coincided with the month of Ramadan, when Muslims observe fasting and no drinking from dawn till dark. This increased the risks of dehydration and heat stroke.\nEmergency measures.\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif declared a state of emergency, activated military relief efforts, and warned electric supply companies that he would not tolerate power outages during Ramadan. The Sindh government declared an emergency for all government hospitals in the province, and the University of Karachi postponed its exams for at least one month. An influential Muslim cleric in Pakistan decreed a fatwa that if \"a religious and qualified doctor\" advises (for safety of life), Muslims are allowed to skip or break their Ramadan daytime fast, and then to complete those days of fasting when Ramadan and the emergency have passed. At the peak of the June 2015 heat wave, the number of corpses exceeded local capacities for storage or burial, as the emergency efforts proved insufficient to prevent enormous loss of life.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The heat wave saw the highest recorded temperatures since 1995, subsequently surpassed in May 2016 by a separate heat wave in Phalodi.\nBackground.\nAccording to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), a heat wave is qualified when air temperatures of at least 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) in the plains or greater than 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in the hilly regions. For the IMD classification of heat waves, temperatures greater than 46\u00a0\u00b0C (114.8\u00a0\u00b0F) are considered and classified as severe heat waves.\nEvery year India experiences severe heat waves in summer, but in the year 2015, casualties were abnormally high. Most of the deaths were concentrated in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar. More than 20,000 people have died of heat-related causes in India since 1990. In the recent past, the most severe period of hot weather occurred in 1995, when 1,677 people died due to a series of heatwaves. 793 people died in 2011 while 1,247 died in 2012 due to heat related causes. In 2013, 1,216 people died due to the heat. With over 2,500 deaths, the heat wave has proven to be the most deadly since 1979. The casualties crossed the mark of previous years rapidly in 2015.\nCauses.\nThe heat wave was caused in large part by sparser pre-monsoon season showers, which brought less moisture than normal to the area, leaving large parts of India arid and dry. The sudden end of pre-monsoon rain showers, an uncommon trend in India, has contributed to the heat waves. Additionally, the monsoon season is later and further south than the normal trend. This weather pattern, coupled with the El Ni\u00f1o effect, which often increases temperatures in Asia, combined to create the record high temperatures. High humidity compounded the effects of the temperatures on residents. The Loo, a dry wind originating from Pakistan and northwest India, has contributed to increasing the temperature in India.\nAffected areas.\nThe heat wave affected many people in various states and regions, including Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar and Jharkhand. On 21 May the temperature in the Indian capital, New Delhi, was reported to be , with black asphalt roads reportedly melting and pedestrian crossing stripes curling. On the same day, a temperature of was recorded in Jharsuguda and at least 12 people were reported dead due to heat stroke the following day. On 24 May in Allahabad, a temperature of was recorded. Cities such as Delhi and Kolkata recorded and on the same day, respectively. In the state of Odisha, 23 people died of heat stroke by 24 May. Many deaths occurred in the state of Andhra Pradesh where at least 246 people have died by 25 May.\nThe temperature in Hyderabad on 21 May was and on 22 May was , above the normal maximum of recorded on the same day in the previous years. On the following day the temperature in the city was also above a normal maximum temperature, at compared to recorded on the same day in earlier years. On 24 May, Khammam recorded its highest ever temperature at . The air temperature on hill stations like Mussoorie, situated above sea level, rose to .\nOn 25 May, more than 90 deaths due to sun stroke were recorded in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The temperature on that day continued to be above normal, especially in the coastal Andhra region where the maximum temperature recorded was in Guntur district. The highest temperature in India recorded on that day was at in Titlagarh, Odisha.\nBy 3 June, 50 lakh (five million) chicken were killed by the heat wave across Telangana within a span of two weeks, causing the price of eggs and chickens to rise throughout the state as well as in the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.\nOn 3 June, rainfall caused the temperatures to decrease in many areas of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. No heat-related deaths were reported on that day across the two states. The highest temperature recorded on the same day was in Nizamabad. On 5 June, Odisha reported temperatures to have decreased to less than across the state, but the humidity continued to be high.\nRelief efforts.\nThe government of Andhra Pradesh announced 100,000 to the next of kin of people killed in the heatwave in the state. Drinking water, oral rehydration salts and intravenous fluids were made available at public places like railway stations and bus stations. Emergency medical camps are set up across the state. An awareness campaign was launched advising citizens to not leave their homes at noon unless absolutely necessary.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

It was associated with severe drought over regions of the southeastern United States and parts of the Great Lakes region.\nHistory.\nThe major heat wave of 2007 lasted from 3 to 25 August across eastern United States, while a second wave hit the Midwest and California in October.\nTemperatures surpassed as far north as Kansas City, MO and St. Louis, MO. Dew points reached the mid-region of , creating heat index values of 108 or more in much of the affected areas. The accompanying high-pressure systems caused drought conditions, especially in areas that were already experiencing drought conditions, such as northern Alabama. It caused drought conditions in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. The drought decreased soil moisture to below 98-99% of normal levels.\nAugust 2007 turned out to be one of the 20 warmest Augusts for the United States since 1895.\nA heat-wave forecast was issued in June 2007 for the Columbus, Ohio area. In Indiana, heat advisories were issued after at least four days of days in early August. In Evansville, Indiana, August had the highest average temperature recorded until that time, , surpassed in 2012. Indianapolis had a 14-day streak of temperatures of or higher. Paducah, Kentucky had 28 straight days of -plus temperatures, a record broken in 2010.\nNorth Carolina experienced temperatures over . In Charlotte, a record high of \" degrees [was] set on 10 August 2007,\" that lasted until August 2012. Ten years later, the National Weather Service labeled the August 2007 heat wave one of the \"Historic Heat Waves in the Carolinas.\" \"Temperatures soared well into the 90s and 100s\u00b0F across almost all of North and South Carolina for three solid weeks, with all-time records for heat tied or broken in a number of locations,\" the NWS reported.\nRecord temperatures were recorded in Rocky Mount, NC, at , Hamlet, NC at , Charlotte at , and Raleigh at . The heat index \"exceeded across portions of the North Carolina coastal plain.\" Local utilities Tennessee Valley Authority and Progress Energy Carolinas recorded the highest energy usage ever, due to air conditioning use.\nThe Piedmont region experienced high temperatures, while Eastern North Carolina experienced low temperatures.\nA new heat island was identified in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania through monitoring hourly temperatures from 27 May to 19 September 2007.\nIn California, \"a record summer heat wave\" dried out tinder and led to dry conditions and fires in October 2007, causing one death and thousands of people to be evacuated. Ultimately, a disaster declaration was made by President George W. Bush. 25 people in California died that year from heat-related causes.\nImpact.\nA total of 105 deaths in 2007 were blamed on the heat that year in the United States, including the deaths from the heat wave. During the heat wave itself, more than 50 deaths were reported, in addition to cases of heat exhaustion and heat Stroke. Most deaths (51%) occurred among those over 60 years of age and people who could not afford air conditioning due to their cost.\nDuring the Chicago Marathon in October, temperatures hit a record , causing dozens of hospitalizations and one death. In 2007, a total of 39 deaths were counted due to the heat from four adjoining states, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky.\nIn Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Medical Society issued a health warning about the dangers and treatment of heat stroke.\nOver \"51 deaths, including 2 in South Carolina, were attributable to this heat wave.\" In Birmingham, Alabama, there were 18 days with a \"heat index greater than or equal to 100,\" lower than the index during the heat wave of 1980, while 13 heat-related deaths were attributed to the August 2007 heat wave, compared to over 100 in 1980. The fewer deaths were attributed to the increased use of air-conditioning in 2007, especially among \"shut in\" elderly people.\nCauses.\nThe heat wave was reportedly caused by several factors. First, an upper level ridge that settled over the southern plains and southeast near the Ozarks. Another cause was the troughing over the Pacific Coast and offshore Atlantic. This in turn created an Omega block pattern over the central US and caused extreme heat to build for weeks, in some cases. The ridge eventually moved back towards the west, which allowed some short-term relief for the northeastern states and Mid-Atlantic, but in the Mississippi River Valley and the southeast there remained strong heat for at least several more days.

It resulted in more than 82 heat-related deaths across the United States and Canada, and an additional twenty-two people died in the resultant June 2012 North American derecho. This long-lived, straight-line wind and its thunderstorms cut electrical power to 3.7 million customers. Over 500,000 were still without power on July 6, as the heat wave continued. Temperatures generally decreased somewhat the week of July 9 in the east, but the high pressure shifted to the west, causing the core of the hot weather to build in the Mountain States and the Southwestern United States shifting eastwards again by mid-July. By early August, the core of the heat remained over the Southern Plains.\nCause.\nThe heat wave formed when high pressure aloft over the Baja California, Mexico, strengthened and moved over the southern plains around June 20\u201323 and then spread east and northward, remaining fixed over the center of North America through July 2012.\nThe direct cause of the heat is that, under high pressure, the air subsides (sinks) toward the surface. This sinking air acts as a dome capping the atmosphere. This cap helps to trap heat instead of allowing it to lift. Without the lift there is little or no convection and therefore little or no convective clouds (cumulus clouds) with minimal chances for rain. The result is a continual build-up of heat at the surface resulting in drought conditions over wide areas.\nThis heat wave, like all extreme weather events, has its direct cause in a complex set of atmospheric conditions that produce short-term weather. However, weather occurs within the broader context of the climate, and many scientists agree that global warming has made it more likely that heat waves of this magnitude will occur. A NASA-sponsored study indicates an increase in the drying tendency from spring to summer over the U.S. Central Plains, especially during the transition from June to July. The intensified deficit in precipitation is accompanied by increased downward shortwave radiation flux, tropospheric subsidence, enhanced evaporative fraction, and elevated planetary boundary layer height, all of which can lead to surface drying. These conditions are similar to those accompanying the 2012 drought and intense heat that occurred in mid-summer.\nTimeline of impacts.\nBeginning of heat wave.\nThe intense heat wave in the West was initiated around June 20\u201323 when the high pressure system centered over the Baja of California shifted upward into the plains and caused temperatures to approach or even surpass 110 \u00b0F (43 \u00b0C) for the next several days, breaking many records for the area.\nThe heat spread east from the Rocky Mountains and a massive high-pressure system over the Midwest caused extreme temperatures not seen on such a scale since the 1930s. On June 25, 2012, Denver, Colorado tied its all-time high with a temperature of 105 \u00b0F (40.6 \u00b0C). On the same day a couple of 113\u00a0\u00b0F (45\u00a0\u00b0C) readings were recorded in Kansas. The heat was so strong that Alamosa, Colorado, broke its daily record for six consecutive days. In Galveston, Texas, the earliest 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) day ever was recorded. Hill City, Kansas, was the warmest point in the United States on June 26, with the thermometer climbing to 115\u00a0\u00b0F (46.1\u00a0\u00b0C).\nThousands of records were again broken on June 28. Fort Wayne, Indiana, tied its all-time record high with 106\u00a0\u00b0F (41.1\u00a0\u00b0C) while Indianapolis broke its monthly record at 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C). More monthly records that day included St. Louis, Missouri, at 108\u00a0\u00b0F (42.2\u00a0\u00b0C) and Little Rock, Arkansas, at 107\u00a0\u00b0F (41.7\u00a0\u00b0C). The heat resulted in two boys from Bradley County, Tennessee, dying of hyperthermia.\nIn the Mid-South, from June 28 through June 30, many notable temperature extremes occurred. In Paducah, Kentucky, June 29 witnessed an all time official record of . In Bowling Green, Kentucky, the same day witnessed , one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 \u00b0C) short of the state's all-time record for June. Perhaps more remarkable, Tennessee observed a handful of all-time record highs. Nashville reached 109\u00a0\u00b0F (42.8 \u00b0C) on June 30, 11 \u00b0F (6.1 \u00b0C) higher than the previous record. Knoxville reached a high of , while Chattanooga reached , an all-time high, on both June 30 and July 1. And, although not officially verified by the National Weather Service at this time, Smyrna, Tennessee, recorded a reading of on the 29th, which would in fact be the highest recorded temperature in the state.\nIn Fort Good Hope, Northwest Territories, there was a streak of five consecutive days above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) from June 21 to June 25 peaking at 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F), quite possibly the longest heat wave in Canada at that time. Further south, on June 19, 20 and 21, Toronto experienced its first official early season heat wave (In Canada, a heat wave is defined as three or more consecutive days with temperatures at or above 32 \u00b0C (89.6 \u00b0F)), with temperatures ranging between 33.4 \u00b0C (92.1 \u00b0F) and 34.5 \u00b0C (94.1 \u00b0F) and the minimum temperature on June 20 not dropping below 24.4 \u00b0C (75.9 \u00b0F). On both July 4 and July 6, Toronto reached 36.3\u00a0\u00b0C (97.3\u00a0\u00b0F) and on July 17, the city hit 36.8\u00a0\u00b0C (98.3\u00a0\u00b0F), making this the hottest day of the year in the city and the 5th record daily high of the summer.\nSpread to Southeastern U.S..\nThe high pressure ridge continued to slide eastward and centered itself over Tennessee, causing hundreds of records to be matched or surpassed for multiple states, including Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina, and Washington D.C., among others.\nThe scorching heat continued on June 29 when Athens, Georgia and Columbia, South Carolina set new all-time record high temperatures of 113 \u00b0F (45 \u00b0C). Washington, D.C. recorded its highest June temperature ever at 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C), and Charlotte, North Carolina and Raleigh, North Carolina were warm enough to tie their all-time record highs at 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C) and 105\u00a0\u00b0F (40.6\u00a0\u00b0C) respectively. On June 30, Atlanta, Georgia set a new all-time record high temperature of 106 \u00b0F (41.1 \u00b0C). A statewide record high was even set across the entire state of South Carolina.\nThe Mid-Atlantic States did not escape the heat. On June 29, Salisbury, Maryland recorded a monthly record high of 101 \u00b0F (38.3 \u00b0C), while Baltimore (DMH) reached 106 \u00b0F (41.1 \u00b0C) on June 29, setting a similar month of June record.\nNortheast and Midwest.\nChicago's O'Hare International Airport tied its all-time 4th of July record of 102\u00a0\u00b0F (38.9\u00a0\u00b0C) which was set back in 1912. Not far from O'Hare, the official measuring station for the city of Chicago, the villages of Park Ridge, Niles, Norridge as well as much of the Chicago metropolitan area recorded a temperature of 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C). Some places north of Chicago got even hotter. Caledonia, Wisconsin, just south of Milwaukee reached 107\u00a0\u00b0F (41.7 \u00b0C). Actual air temperatures were close to 110\u00a0\u00b0F (43.3 \u00b0C) in and around the city of Allegan, Michigan. St. Louis endured a string of ten straight days with temperatures above 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38 \u00b0C), ending on July 7. As of July 7, three deaths in St. Louis were attributed to the heat.\nAs of July 6, Chicago has had four official or higher temperature readings, one on June 28, along with three in July, culminating with an official near-record shattering high of at O'Hare on both July 5 and 6, reaching near Chicago, the following day reaching 98\u00a0\u00b0F shortly before 11 AM at O'Hare International Airport, but much of the Chicago metro area west and south of the airport reached or exceeded 100 degrees, marking the fourth consecutive day of 100-degree heat across the Chicago area. The city proper tied the old record of three consecutive 100-degree days which was set back in August 1947. Normally, the highest temperature recorded in a typical Chicago summer is around , a streak of 3 days above constitutes a \"heat wave\", and the thermometer reaches or surpasses only once every five to ten years. The Chicago temperatures exceeded the 1995 Chicago heat wave, which claimed over 750 lives, although humidity and registered dew points were higher during that heat wave. Through the first five days of July, the mean temperature in Chicago averaged , above normal, the hottest since 1911. Two deaths were confirmed from the heat in Cook County, and two other people died in a train derailment blamed on the heat. An additional death in Rock County, Wisconsin has been noted.\nThe heat caused highways to buckle in Illinois, North Carolina and Wisconsin.\nAfter a brief respite from the extreme heat, the Mid-Atlantic States resumed observation of record highs by the end of the first week of July. Maryland has been particularly hard-hit, with eight deaths, including four on July 5. Cumberland, Maryland recorded a monthly record of on July 8. Bremo Bluff, Virginia recorded an astounding , which is an all-time-record high on July 8.\nThe Northeastern United States suffered the worst of the heat wave on July 7\u20138. Even normally cool plateau regions experienced highs over 90\u00a0\u00b0F. Laurel Mountain, Pennsylvania, near Johnstown, reached on July 8, beating the previous all-time-record high by 2\u00a0\u00b0F (1.1 \u00b0C). Similarly, on July 7, daily record highs were broken in several cities in eastern Pennsylvania, including Harrisburg, Lancaster, and Chambersburg, which each reached . Pittsburgh reached 98\u00b0 on July 7, which, while not a daily record (101\u00b0 in 1988), was the hottest temperature recorded there since it reached 100\u00b0 on July 15, 1995. Cleveland, Ohio reached 101\u00a0\u00b0F on July 21. Akron-Canton airport said that it was its warmest year on record with an all time July record of 101\u00a0\u00b0F on July 7th. \nOn July 8, the heat eased across the east as the high pressure center shifted west, causing hot weather once again build in the mountain states and the southwest U. S.\nHeat continues in Great Plains, spreads into New England.\nAfter some modification in the heat during the past week over the midwest and northeast, the jet once again moved further north into Canada allowing intense heat to build across eastern North America. On July 15, Temperatures reached in Pierre, South Dakota.\nOn July 17, the temperature at Detroit, Michigan Metro Airport climbed to , the third plus 100 degree day thus far in July. The average July maximum temperature is .\nThe Northeastern states also experienced a second round of heat, with temps again returning to the 90's. Atlantic City, New Jersey reached on July 18, a daily record high. The same day, Newark, New Jersey reached , a daily record. Teterboro Airport, NJ recorded a monthly record high of . Philadelphia, PA hit a temperature of . Triple-digit temperatures even reached Hartford, Connecticut, where, on July 18, the city reached , which was a monthly record high.\nAs of July 25, St. Louis, Missouri endured its 16th straight day of plus heat with 27 of the past 28 days exceeding this temperature, with high 90s forecast over the next few days. 24 deaths have been attributed to the heat in St. Louis metro area.\nHeat wave continues in the Southwest.\nAs of August 13, 90 to 100-degree plus heat was still occurring in the desert Southwest and in many western states, associated with the same upper-level ridge of high pressure. The heat wave continued at one location or another within the Contiguous US for over two months' worth of consecutive days. A major jet stream dip and associated upper-level trough of low pressure brought rain, storms, and cooler weather to parts of the eastern and central US, slightly lessening drought impacts in some areas.\nOther impacts.\nWildfires raged across the western United States during the time of the heat wave, in part attributable to the dry conditions caused by the heat. The Waldo Canyon fire in Colorado attracted the most attention after spreading into Colorado Springs and charring hundreds of homes (investigators determined it to be human caused, rather than from \"the heat\"), but large wildfires also burned throughout Utah, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona and Idaho.\nThe heat wave also contributed to the record-shattering 2012 North American drought, which caused massive crop failures throughout the Midwest. The drought affected 80% of the contiguous US as of July 24, and was considered the worst drought since the 1950s but not yet on the scale of devastation endured during the dust bowl of the 1930s.\nSevere storms.\nOn July 26, 2012, the heat wave contributed to the formation of a multi-bow serial derecho in the Midwest and Northeast.\nOn June 29\u201330, 2012, the heat and humidity from the heat wave caused a small thunderstorm in Iowa to develop into a violent and unprecedented derecho, which tracked across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States while causing or higher winds, doing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, and downing trees and power lines, leaving four million people in the eastern U. S. without power.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

It was part of one of the warmest summers recorded in the UK, and one of the warmest Augusts ever recorded in many locations around the UK, as well as being one of the driest summers ever recorded in the UK; many weather stations recorded the summer of 1995 as drier than, or comparable with, the summer of 1976. Ireland was also widely affected by the heatwave with temperatures reaching over in some locations, as well as exceptionally low rainfall throughout the summer.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, the heat wave of 1995 currently marks the warmest August on record, and the third-warmest summer overall, behind 1976 and 1826. The CET Central England station recorded a daily mean temperature of and a mean daily maximum temperature of in August, and a daily mean temperature of for the entire summer.\nBefore the heatwave formed, a mini-heatwave occurred between 28 and 30 June, with a highest temperature recorded during this short period of recorded on 30 June 1995 at Barbourne, Worcester. Low rainfall was also widely recorded around the nation during the month of June, many stations reporting less than 50% of its average rainfall, with some locations reporting less than 20%.\nJuly 1995 then continued the hot weather, with an average daily temperature of meaning that it is the seventh-warmest July in the CET records back to 1659. It was very dry too, with most places recording less than 30% of average rainfall. Days frequently reached above , culminating at on the 31st. Higher temperatures were recorded in August, though.\nDuring the heatwave, many locations around the UK recorded peak temperatures at the start of August. The highest temperature recorded during the heatwave was recorded on 1 August 1995 at Boxworth, Cambridgeshire. After this, most of the United Kingdom was still under warm temperatures around or above , until temperatures rose again as high as which was recorded at Barbourne, Worcester. Toward the end of the hot spell, temperatures rose up to in many parts of the country. Cheltenham in Gloucestershire recorded three consecutive days above from 20 to 22 August, with the highest temperature at on 22 August.\nMuch of the United Kingdom suffered drought conditions during August, with most parts of the UK recording less than 30% of its average rainfall, and most parts of England less than 20%. Many weather stations around the United Kingdom recorded no days of rain to the value of \u2265 1.0\u00a0mm.\nAftermath.\nAfter the heat wave ended in August, the east and south of the United Kingdom received high rainfall in September, but another dry spell occurred mainly in the east of the UK. For the rest of 1995, most of the UK received below-average rainfall. Temperatures after the heatwave remained around average for the rest of the year (with further unseasonably warm weather in October), except for a record-breaking cold spell from Christmas to New Year.\nIreland.\nWhile temperatures were lower, Ireland experienced a similar weather pattern to that of the United Kingdom during the summer of 1995.\nThe Valentia Observatory and the weather station at Phoenix Park both recorded a daily mean temperature of , and it was the warmest summer for over a century.\nKilkenny recorded a total of 27 days with temperatures over during the heat wave, compared to the 2.5 days that the town usually records, and was one of the hottest parts of the country during the heatwave, recording a maximum temperature of . Like the United Kingdom, Ireland received exceptionally low rainfall, and it was the driest summer on record for the weather stations at Malin Head, Casement Aerodrome and Cork Airport. The overall rainfall recorded during the summer at Phoenix Park was only .\nThe highest temperature recorded during the heatwave was and was measured at Oak Park in County Carlow on 2 August. It is currently Ireland's hottest August temperature reading, equalling the measurement at Ballybrittas in County Laois on 3 August 1975.\nImpacts.\nLike the United Kingdom, Ireland experienced drought conditions throughout the summer, which caused problems to potato farmers in rural areas, as they had difficulty watering crops due to water shortages. Several areas around Ireland were also issued with hosepipe bans, and residents were asked not to hose lawns due to drought conditions.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

However, by September 13, Dallas had endured 71 non-consecutive days with temperatures exceeding , beating the record of 69 days set in 1980.\nOn August 24, a 5-hour long severe thunderstorm hit Southern Ontario that evening which also spawned a pair of weak tornadoes, nothing particularly unusual for August, but it set records for lightning frequency, thought to be fueled by abnormally high Lake Ontario water surface temperatures due to the heat wave.\nRecord heat.\nThe National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina reported that the United States had the hottest summer on record in 2011. Since 1901, only the Dust Bowl era summer of 1936 was hotter. Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Louisiana all reported their hottest summer on record. Delaware had a record warm July in 2011. Based on an index of residential energy demand, 2011 was the hottest summer on record. However, the states of Oregon and Washington recorded cooler than average summers, while California recorded its wettest. \nWater levels.\nThe continuing heat and drought resulted in several lakes dropping to record lows, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma. This resulted in re-exposing old towns and other historical sites that were submerged by dam construction. The original site of Bluffton, Texas was re-exposed, revealing a town site that had been submerged under Lake Buchanan since a dam was completed in 1939. The town of Woodville, Oklahoma was also re-exposed as Lake Texoma dropped.\nArkansas.\nLittle Rock, Arkansas.\nLittle Rock, Arkansas was the 2nd hottest city during the heat wave (Dallas, Texas was number 1). Temperature readings were as high as 113\u00a0\u00b0F on August 3, 2011.\nColorado.\nColorado Springs, Colorado.\nIn Colorado Springs, temperatures reached (near record highs) as early as June. Daytime highs in June, July, and August were about 6\u00b0 F above average. Temperatures were elevated during the heat wave, but remained cooler than temperatures in the Great Plains to the east.\nPueblo, Colorado.\nPueblo, Colorado experienced temperatures up to as early as June. On August 5, 2011, Pueblo recorded a temperature of , breaking the record of set back in 1954.\nDenver, Colorado.\nDenver, Colorado saw temperatures as high as as early as June 19, 2011. Denver International Airport recorded a high of on June 29, 2011. This broke the record of set back in 1978. The high of was set on July 28, 2011. This temperature broke the previous record of set back in 1991.\nWyoming.\nCheyenne, Wyoming.\nCheyenne, Wyoming also recorded above average temperatures during the heat wave. On August 5, 2011, Cheyenne was compared to the average.\nKansas.\nWichita, Kansas.\nFully subjected to the heat wave, Wichita had an unusually hot summer in 2011. Wichita reached a temperature of twice over the course of the heat wave, once in July, and once in August. Daytime highs in the months of June, July, and August averaged almost 9\u00a0\u00b0F over prior observed normals. The year was also substantially drier than average.\nOklahoma.\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma.\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma experienced extremely hot temperatures in the summer of 2011, and below normal rainfall. While winter, spring, and fall temperatures were close to normals, Central Oklahoma started to experience abnormally high temperatures after a very wet month of May. High temperatures in the months of June, July, and August were 9\u00a0\u00b0F above normals, and overnight lows were also significantly above norm. The heat was so extreme, that OGE, the area's main electricity provider, refused to cut off electric service in the month of August, as it felt that this might result in deaths among the elderly, many of whom used electric power to air-condition their homes. The following data is for the weather station at Will Rogers World Airport, located southwest of the city, which during the summer, experienced a peak temperature of . Due to the urban heat island effect, most of the urban area of Oklahoma City was even hotter than the temperatures recorded at the airport. One weather station, located in an urban part of the city, recorded an air temperature of on August 3. The heat wave finally ended on September 15, 2011, when a cold front moved through Central Oklahoma.\nLawton, Oklahoma.\nLawton, Oklahoma experienced even hotter weather than Oklahoma City reported. In Lawton, daytime high temperatures during the months of June, July, and August averaged 11\u00a0\u00b0F above the previously observed normals, and nighttime lows averaged 8\u00a0\u00b0F above normal. In at least one weather station in Lawton, less than half the normal rainfall was recorded over the course of the year, and almost none was recorded during the summer.\nTulsa, Oklahoma.\nTulsa, Oklahoma was also affected by the heat wave with temperatures maxing out on August 5, 2011. High temperatures of were recorded in Tulsa the following day. On August 8, 2011, high temperatures reached , almost breaking the record high temperature of set back in 1935. Up until October, temperatures in the city remained in the high 80s to the low 100s.\nTexas.\nDallas, Texas.\nDallas, Texas was affected by the heat wave. In Dallas, temperatures in the months of June, July, and August averaged 8\u00a0\u00b0F above normals. Dallas also received a below normal amount of precipitation during the year, and no measurable rainfall in July.\nAmarillo, Texas.\nThe Amarillo, Texas area, along with the rest of Texas and the Southern Plains, experienced the worst of the heat wave. Summertime temperatures soared at high as in June, and the overall precipitation was only a third of the average. For the months of June, July, and August, average highs were 10\u00a0\u00b0F above normal, and overnight low temperatures were 6\u00a0\u00b0F above normal.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

It was an ABC Movie of the Week. Its running time was 90 minutes. The film was directed by Jerry Jameson, produced by Herbert F. Solow and Harve Bennett.\nThe plot focuses upon the effect an intense and prolonged heat wave and water shortage has on Frank Taylor and his pregnant wife Laura Taylor, both while they are in the city where they live and after they decide to relocate.\nPlot.\nWhen the heat wave eventually causes a total blackout that shuts down the brokerage firm where Frank works, he and Laura decide to relocate to a mountain cabin in a remote small town\u2014which is also affected by the heat, blackout, and water shortage.\nOn the way to the cabin, the Taylors' car is taken from them; and they are forced to walk eight miles to the town. When the Taylors reach the town, they go to see Dr. Grayson, who appears to be Laura's old family physician. Dr. Grayson advises Laura that it is important for her to rest given the stress she has been under in the hot, dry conditions.\nAfter Laura has seen the doctor, the Taylors go to the cabin and find two young hikers have taken shelter there. After being briefly angry, the Taylors decide to allow the hikers to stay.\nLaura rests in the cabin. However, she still gives birth prematurely.\nAfter the baby is born, Dr. Grayson states the baby cannot survive without being in an incubator, particularly because of the extreme conditions. Dr. Grayson also states that he not only has no incubator but that he would be unable to run one as he has no fuel for his generator. (He is out, and the pumps fuel stations use are powered by electricity). However, with the assistance of the hikers and two town residents, Frank is able to build and power a makeshift incubator.\nWhen the baby has been placed in the incubator, the characters hear that it is raining, which\u2014in the movie\u2014indicates the heat wave has broken and the water shortage will end.\nProduction.\n\u2019Due to the complete lack of budget, a lot of things happen off screen. There are mentions of forest fires and constant references to \u2018brown outs\u2019 \u2019\u2019.\nAlternative titles.\nThis movie is also known by other titles outside the United States; they include the European English name of \"Heatwave\" and the French name of \"120 degr\u00e9s Fahrenheit\".\nReception.\nA retrospective review finds that the film is \"Really more a drama than a disaster movie\". Various reviewers express the lack of interest or empathy provoked by the main character: \"\"Heatwave! \"suffers from an unlikable and ineffective main character in Frank, who by the time he inexplicably shrugs all that off to construct an advanced medical device from a fish tank, fan, mini-fridge and cloth, has completely lost the audience.\" They also insist on the cinematographic challenge of visually showing a heatwave on screen, and failure of the film to do so: \"The biggest hole of all, though, I have to say, is the premise itself. Unlike, say, earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanoes, or tsunamis, there is no visual component to a heat wave.\"", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

Although the heat wave did not set many still-standing daily temperature records, it was exceptionally prolonged \u2013 covering without interruption the second half of June and all of July \u2013 and centered upon more highly populated areas than later American heat waves. The heat wave accompanied a major drought in the Ohio Valley and Upper Midwest, with Illinois recording what remains its driest calendar year since records have been kept, and Missouri receiving only above its driest calendar year of 1953.\nJune.\nIn spite of frequent nor'easters leading to record heavy rainfall over East Coast states from Massachusetts to South Carolina during April and May, drought had already been developing over the interior. However, only over the sparsely populated far-northern Great Plains was the spring unusually hot.\nThe heat really set in during the second week of June, when Springfield, Missouri, began a sequence of fifty days with a lowest maximum of and an average maximum of . It intensified and spread from June 25, when Philadelphia began twelve consecutive days above \u2013 a record it did not surpass until 1953. Some days in Philadelphia and nearby Wilmington, Delaware, got as hot as . As the heat wave spread to New York City \u2013 in an era without sanitation or air conditioning \u2013 it had by the close of June begun to severely disrupt life. It was documented that by the end of June several deranged inhabitants committed suicide when emotionally disturbed by the hot and still weather, which had risen to a maximum of and a minimum of by the end of June.\nJuly.\nJuly 1901 was the hottest month over the contiguous United States until the 1930s, and is currently surpassed only by the Julys of 1931, 1934, 1936 and 2012. It remains the hottest month on record in Kentucky and West Virginia, and throughout the eastern half, heat was extremely persistent without any cool interval \u2013 although a violent tornado hit Inwood on the northern tip of Manhattan with heavy rainfall on the fifth.\nWith the persistent heat, most horses collapsed, and their carcasses became a source of germs that greatly added to the already high mortality rate in major cities. In one day alone, 250 horses died in New York City, and by the end of July's first week, public streetcars had ceased to run because horses could not be fed. Most factories were closed by the beginning of the month, and those which continued to operate had to permit their workers to wear light gymnastic costumes, as these were the only cooler alternative to the three-piece suits considered polite dress at the time.\nAs the heat failed to relent over the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic states, it spread to the established summer resort of Marquette, Michigan, during the middle of July. On the 14th, Marquette \u2013 after staying below on all but five days of the heat wave's first month \u2013 recorded , which was hotter than ever experienced there before and hotter than any temperature recorded since. Then, a week later, without a cool break, the heat intensified further between July 21 and 25, when most of the maximum temperatures of the year were recorded. On the 22nd, Louisville reached ; Chicago, with a minimum; and Indianapolis, with a minimum. Farm work was abandoned, and the poorer sections of the population had to rely on canned vegetables for food due to the scarcity of fresh produce.\nAftermath.\nThe heat wave gradually eased at the beginning of August, with temperatures in the Ohio Valley falling to more seasonal levels on August 5, for the first time in over fifty days. Although August was an extremely wet month in the Deep South and along the Atlantic Coast, it was exceptionally dry west and north of the Ohio River.\nIn the most extensive study of American heat waves, it was estimated that the 1901 Eastern heat wave claimed the lives of 9,500 people, which makes it easily the most destructive disaster of its type in US history.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The slogans used to promote the show were variously the \"Punk Woodstock\", the \"New Wave Woodstock\", or \"The 1980s Big Beat Rock and Roll Party\". The festival was noteworthy because of the importance of the headliner bands that played and the timing in the evolution of new wave music, and the size of the crowd.\nHistory.\nThe festival was noteworthy because of the importance of the headliner bands that played and the timing in the evolution of new wave music, and from the size of the crowd. Tickets were $20 ($25 at the gate). 85,000 people attended but at 5 pm Dan Aykroyd, in character as Elwood Blues, during a live radio interview from backstage with friend and festival promoter John Brower, asked Brower if he could invite everyone listening to come out and be on his guest list. Brower immediately agreed and within 90 minutes another 15,000 people poured into the park swelling the crowd to almost 100,000 just as Talking Heads took the stage as the sun set. The crowd inched forward to accommodate the \"guests\" and a sense of wonder swept over everyone as no one other than Brower and Aykroyd and the radio audience was aware of the last minute free invitation. Scandal plagued the event with accusations tossed back and forth between the backers and park management, the latter claiming to have thrown away all the ticket stubs as \"no one told them to keep them\". The event reportedly lost a million dollars.\nDespite the fact that no rights agreements were signed, the entire concert was recorded professionally. The tapes surfaced sometime later that year and were secured by Brower after being turned over by the studio whose recording truck had been on location to record Teenage Head, the band. In the mid 1990s the tapes were handed over to Canadian independent record executive Jan Haust by Brower to ensure their professional restoration and safe keeping. 102 of those tracks, by the five most famous of the bands, were acquired by Wolfgangs, which also holds the rights to Bill \"Wolfgang\" Graham's archive; by 2017 they were posted on its website. A video recording of a portion of the set played by The Kings has also been released.\nAt the time of the festival, a new wave/punk festival seemed a novel idea to many, especially as many of these bands typically played at night, in clubs\u2014not outdoors in the hot summer sunlight. Rock magazine \"CREEM\" published an overview of Heatwave from that point of view, using a few words of parody in comparison to Woodstock.\nIt may bear further verification, but some remember The Ramones as being initially announced for the festival.\nGroups.\nThe groups were:\nThe Clash were originally booked, and were on the poster, but cancelled or, by another story, were held up at the border due to customs.\nA partial order of appearance was: Teenage Head (opened at 11:00 am), The Rumour, Rockpile, Holly and the Italians, Pretenders, B-52's, Talking Heads (sunset), Elvis Costello, and the Kings (midnight).\nTeenage Head set list.\nThe reviewer saw \"two scraggly guys playing guitar and bass, and a crop-haired singer in long-tailed livery coat and eyeliner. ... good ol' head-banging ramalama punk rock. A large and vocal following cheers them on, and they play with confidence, as if they belong up front of all those people.\" A year or so later, Teenage Head's live album had a picture from their Heatwave set on the cover. Their set included \"Wild One\" (from the \"Frantic City\" album).\nThe Pretenders set list.\nThe Pretenders played a full set at Heatwave photo and ticket.\nThe B-52's set list.\nPerforming the strongest material from their first album and debuting much of the Wild Planet material before the largest live audience they had experienced up to this point.\nTalking Heads set list.\nThe band that toured for the \"Remain in Light\" album, including Adrian Belew, performed for the first time at Heatwave as the sun was setting. Their segment began with the four original members plus Belew, and then, as the songs progressed, they added musicians and vocalists, including Nona Hendryx (vocals), Busta Jones, Steve Scales, Dolette McDonald, and Bernie Worrell (keyboards).\nElvis Costello set list.\nThe Heatwave festival was the only 1980 live concert in North America by Elvis Costello and the Attractions.\nRecorded and available as a two LP disk album. \"Sounds like an audience recording...\"\nThe Kings.\nTheir set started about midnight, and they played an hour long show which included \"This Beat Goes On/Switchin' to Glide\".", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}

They also often have high thermal conductivities and are highly resistant to thermal shock, meaning they can withstand sudden and extreme changes in temperature without cracking or breaking. Chemically, they are usually borides, carbides, nitrides, and oxides of early transition metals.\nUHTCs are used in various high-temperature applications, such as heat shields for spacecraft, furnace linings, hypersonic aircraft components and nuclear reactor components. They can be fabricated through various methods, including hot pressing, spark plasma sintering, and chemical vapor deposition. Despite their advantages, UHTCs also have some limitations, such as their brittleness and difficulty in machining. However, ongoing research is focused on improving the processing techniques and mechanical properties of UHTCs.\nHistory.\nBeginning in the early 1960s, demand for high-temperature materials by the nascent aerospace industry prompted the US Air Force Materials Laboratory to begin funding the development of a new class of materials that could withstand the environment of proposed hypersonic vehicles such as the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar and the Space Shuttle at Manlabs Incorporated. Through a systematic investigation of the refractory properties of binary ceramics, they discovered that the early transition metal borides, carbides, and nitrides had surprisingly high thermal conductivity, resistance to oxidation, and reasonable mechanical strength when small grain sizes were used. Of these, ZrB2 and HfB2 in composites containing approximately 20% volume SiC were found to be the best performing.\nUHTC research was largely abandoned after the pioneering mid-century Manlabs work due to the completion of the Space Shuttle missions and the elimination of the Air force spaceplane development. Three decades later, however, research interest was rekindled by a string of 1990s era NASA programs aimed at developing a fully reusable hypersonic spaceplane such as the National Aerospace Plane, Venturestar/X-33, Boeing X-37, and the Air Force's Blackstar program. New research in UHTCs was led by NASA Ames, with research at the center continuing to the present through funding from the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program. UHTCs also saw expanded use in varied environments, from nuclear engineering to aluminum production.\nIn order to test real world performance of UHTC materials in reentry environments, NASA Ames conducted two flight experiments in 1997 and 2000. The slender Hypersonic Aero-thermodynamic Research Probes (SHARP B1 and B2) briefly exposed the UHTC materials to actual reentry environments by mounting them on modified nuclear ordnance Mk12A reentry vehicles and launching them on Minuteman III ICBMs. Sharp B-1 had a HfB2/SiC nosecone with a tip radius of 3.5\u00a0mm which experienced temperatures well above 2,815\u00a0\u00b0C during reentry, ablating away at an airspeed of 6.9\u00a0km/s as predicted; however, it was not recovered and its axially-symmetric cone shape did not provide flexural strength data needed to evaluate the performance of UHTCs in linear leading edges. To improve the characterization of UHTC mechanical strength and better study their performance, SHARP-B2, was recovered and included four retractable, sharp wedge-like protrusions called \"strakes\" which each contained three different UHTC compositions which were extended into the reentry flow at different altitudes.\nThe SHARP-B2 test that followed permitted recovery of four segmented strakes which had three sections, each consisting of a different HfB2 or ZrB2 composite as shown in Figure 1. The vehicle was successfully recovered, despite the fact that it impacted the sea at three times the predicted velocity. The four rear strake segments (HfB2) fractured between 14 and 19 seconds into reentry, two mid segments (ZrB2/SiC) fractured, and no fore strake segments (ZrB2/SiC/C) failed. The actual heat flux was 60% less than expected, actual temperatures were much lower than expected, and heat flux on the rear strakes was much higher than expected. The material failures were found to result from very large grain sizes in the composites and pure ceramics, with cracks following macroscopic crystal grain boundaries. Since this test, NASA Ames has continued refining production techniques for UHTC synthesis and performing basic research on UHTCs.\nPhysical properties.\nMost research conducted in the last two decades has focused on improving the performance of the two most promising compounds developed by Manlabs, ZrB2 and HfB2, though significant work has continued in characterizing the nitrides, oxides, and carbides of the group four and five elements. In comparison to carbides and nitrides, the diborides tend to have higher thermal conductivity but lower melting points, a tradeoff which gives them good thermal shock resistance and makes them ideal for many high-temperature thermal applications. The melting points of many UHTCs are shown in Table 1. Despite the high melting points of pure UHTCs, they are unsuitable for many refractory applications because of their high susceptibility to oxidation at elevated temperatures.\nTable 1. Crystal structures, densities, and melting points of selected UHTCs.\nStructure.\nUHTCs all exhibit strong covalent bonding which gives them structural stability at high temperatures. Metal carbides are brittle due to the strong bonds that exist between carbon atoms. The largest class of carbides, including Hf, Zr, Ti and Ta carbides have high melting points due to covalent carbon networks although carbon vacancies often exist in these materials; indeed, HfC has one of the highest melting points of any material. Nitrides such as ZrN and HfN have similarly strong covalent bonds but their refractory nature makes them especially difficult to synthesize and process. The stoichiometric nitrogen content can be varied in these complexes based on the synthetic technique utilized; different nitrogen content will give different properties to the material, such as how if x exceeds 1.2 in ZrNx, a new optically transparent and electrically insulating phase appears to form. Ceramic borides such as HfB2 and ZrB2 benefit from very strong bonding between boron atoms as well as strong metal to boron bonds; the hexagonal close-packed structure with alternating two-dimensional boron and metal sheets give these materials high but anisotropic strength as single crystals. Borides exhibit high thermal conductivity (on the order of 75\u2013105 W/mK) and low coefficients of thermal expansion (5\u20137.8 x 10\u22126 K\u22121) and improved oxidation resistance in comparison to other classes of UHTCs. Thermal expansion, thermal conductivity and other data are shown in Table 2. The crystal structures, lattice parameters, densities, and melting points of different UHTCs are shown in Table 1.\nTable 2. Thermal expansion coefficients across selected temperature ranges and thermal conductivity at a fixed temperature for selected UHTCs.\nThermodynamic properties.\nIn comparison with carbide and nitride-based ceramics, diboride-based UHTCs exhibit higher thermal conductivity (refer to Table 2, where we can see that hafnium diboride has thermal conductivity of 105, 75, 70\u00a0W/m*K at different temperature while hafnium carbide and nitride have values only around 20W/m*K). Thermal shock resistance of HfB2 and ZrB2 was investigated by ManLabs and it was found that these materials did not fail at thermal gradients sufficient for the failure of SiC; indeed, it was found that hollow cylinders could not be cracked by an applied radial thermal gradient without first being notched on the inner surface. UHTCs generally exhibit thermal expansion coefficients in the range of 5.9\u20138.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 K\u22121.The structural and thermal stability of ZrB2 and HfB2 UHTCs results from the occupancy of bonding and antibonding levels in hexagonal MB2 structures with alternating hexagonal sheets of metal and boride atoms. In such structures, the principal frontier electronic states are bonding and antibonding orbitals resulting from bonding between boron 2p orbitals and metal d orbitals; before group (IV), the number of available electrons in a unit cell is insufficient to fill all bonding orbitals, and beyond it they begin to fill the antibonding orbitals. Both effects reduce the overall bonding strength in the unit cell and therefore the enthalpy of formation and melting point. Experimental evidence shows that as one moves across the transition metal series in a given period, the enthalpy of formation of MB2 ceramics increases and peaks at Ti, Zr, and Hf before decaying as the metal gets heavier. As a result, the enthalpies of formation of several important UHTCs are as follows: HfB2 &gt; TiB2 &gt; ZrB2 &gt; TaB2 &gt; NbB2 &gt; VB2.\nMechanical properties.\nTable 3 lists UHTC carbides and borides mechanical properties. It is extremely important that UHTCs are able to retain high bending strength and hardness at high temperatures (above 2000\u00a0\u00b0C). UHTCs generally exhibit hardness above 20 GPa due to the strong covalent bonds present in these materials. However, the different methods of processing UHTCs can lead to great variation in hardness values. UHTCs exhibit high flexural strengths of &gt;\u00a0200 MPa at 1,800\u00a0\u00b0C, and UHTCs with fine-grained particles exhibit higher flexural strengths than UHTCs with coarse grains. It has been shown that diboride ceramics synthesized as a composite with silicon carbide (SiC) exhibit increased fracture toughness (increase of 20% to 4.33 MPam1/2) relative to the pure diborides. This is due to material densification and a reduction in grain size upon processing.\nTable. 3 Flexural strength, hardness, and Young's Modulus at given temperatures for selected UHTCs.\nThe UHTC composites show higher mechanical properties like Tensile strength, Young's modulus, hardness, flexural strength, and fracture toughness at high temperatures as compared to monolithic UHTCs. The high sintering temperature and pressure result in high residual stress in the composites, which can be released at high temperatures. Therefore, the mechanical properties increase with the increase in temperature.\nAt 1,200\u00a0\u00b0C, the flexural strength of SiC is 170 MPa vs SiC-ZrC (10 wt%) is 350 MPa. At 2,000\u00a0\u00b0C, Titanium Carbide's flexural strength is 410 MPa vs TiC-WC (5% vol) is 491 MPa vs TiC-SiC (40% vol) is 543 MPa. Similarly the flexural strength for TaC-SiC (20% vol) is 715 MPa at 1,900\u00a0\u00b0C which is about 40% higher than TaC (500 MPa) at the same temperature.\nThe Young's modulus for TiC-WC (3.5 wt%) - CNT(2 wt%) at 1,600\u00a0\u00b0C is 428 GPa vs 300 GPa for TiC and the flexural toughness of TiC-WC (3.5 wt%) - CNT (2 wt%) at the same temperature is 8.1 MPa m1/2 as compared to TiC which is 3.7 MPa m1/2. For ZrC the fracture toughness at 1,900\u00a0\u00b0C is 4 MPa m1/2 which increases to 5.8 MPa m1/2 for ZrC-ZrO2(40 wt.%).\nThe high strength of the materials is obtained due to the high homogeneities of the microstructures and the solute dispersion in the microstructures.\u00a0\nA significant enhancement in hardness (~30%) of (Hf-Ta-Zr-Nb)C material compared to the monolithic UHTCs (HfC, TaC, ZrC, NbC) and in comparison to the hardest monocarbide (HfC) and the binary (Hf-Ta)C was recorded. The mechanism behind this enhancement in hardness maybe because of bonding behavior or some solid solution hardening effects arising from localized lattice strains.\nFor applications based on combustion harsh environments and aerospace, Monolithic UHTCs are of concern because of their low fracture toughness and brittle behavior. UHTC composites are a potential approach to overcome these deficiencies.\nChemical properties.\nWhile UHTCs have desirable thermal and mechanical properties, they are susceptible to oxidation at their elevated operating temperatures. The metal component oxidizes to a gas such as CO2 or NO2, which is rapidly lost at the elevated temperatures UHTCs are most useful at; boron, for example, readily oxidizes to B2O3 which becomes a liquid at 490\u00a0\u00b0C and vaporizes very rapidly above 1,100\u00a0\u00b0C; in addition, their brittleness makes them poor engineering materials. Current research targets increasing their toughness and oxidation resistance by exploring composites with silicon carbide, the incorporation of fibers, and the addition of rare-earth hexaborides such as lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). It has been found that the oxidative resistance of HfB2 and ZrB2 are greatly enhanced through the inclusion of 30% weight silicon carbide due to the formation of a protective glassy surface layer upon the application of temperatures in excess of 1,000\u00a0\u00b0C composed of SiO2. To determine the effect of SiC content on diboride oxidation, ManLabs conducted a series of furnace oxidation experiments, in which the oxidation scale thickness as a function of temperature for pure HfB2, SiC and HfB2 20 v% SiC were compared. At temperatures greater than 2,100 K the oxide scale thickness on pure HfB2 is thinner than that on pure SiC, and HfB2/20% SiC has the best oxidation resistance. Extreme heat treatment leads to greater oxidation resistance as well as improved mechanical properties such as fracture resistance.\nSynthesis of diboride (Zr, Hf, Ti) UHTCs.\nUHTCs possess simple empirical formulas and thus can be prepared by a wide variety of synthetic methods. UHTCs such as ZrB2 can be synthesized by stoichiometric reaction between constituent elements, in this case Zr and B. This reaction provides for precise stoichiometric control of the materials. At 2,000 K, the formation of ZrB2 via stoichiometric reaction is thermodynamically favorable (\u0394G=\u2212279.6 kJ mol\u22121) and therefore, this route can be used to produce ZrB2 by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). This technique takes advantage of the high exothermic energy of the reaction to cause high temperature, fast combustion reactions. Advantages of SHS include higher purity of ceramic products, increased sinterability, and shorter processing times. However, the extremely rapid heating rates can result in incomplete reactions between Zr and B, the formation of stable oxides of Zr, and the retention of porosity. Stoichiometric reactions have also been carried out by reaction of attrition milled (wearing materials by grinding) Zr and B powder (and then hot pressing at 600\u00a0\u00b0C for 6 h), and nanoscale particles have been obtained by reacting attrition milled Zr and B precursor crystallites (10\u00a0nm in size). Unfortunately, all of the stoichiometric reaction methods for synthesizing UHTCs employ expensive charge materials, and therefore these methods are not useful for large-scale or industrial applications.\nReduction of ZrO2 and HfO2 to their respective diborides can also be achieved via metallothermic reduction. Inexpensive precursor materials are used and reacted according to the reaction below:\nZrO2 + B2O3 + 5Mg \u2192 ZrB2 + 5MgO\nMg is used as a reactant in order to allow for acid leaching of unwanted oxide products. Stoichiometric excesses of Mg and B2O3 are often required during metallothermic reductions in order to consume all available ZrO2. These reactions are exothermic and can be used to produce the diborides by SHS. Production of ZrB2 from ZrO2 via SHS often leads to incomplete conversion of reactants, and therefore double SHS (DSHS) has been employed by some researchers. A second SHS reaction with Mg and H3BO3 as reactants along with the ZrB2/ZrO2 mixture yields increased conversion to the diboride, and particle sizes of 25\u201340\u00a0nm at 800\u00a0\u00b0C. After metallothermic reduction and DSHS reactions, MgO can be separated from ZrB2 by mild acid leaching.\nSynthesis of UHTCs by boron carbide reduction is one of the most popular methods for UHTC synthesis. The precursor materials for this reaction (ZrO2/TiO2/HfO2 and B4C) are less expensive than those required by the stoichiometric and borothermic reactions. ZrB2 is prepared at greater than 1,600\u00a0\u00b0C for at least 1 hour by the following reaction:\n2ZrO2 + B4C + 3C \u2192 2ZrB2 + 4CO\nThis method requires a slight excess of boron, as some boron is oxidized during boron carbide reduction. ZrC has also been observed as a product from the reaction, but if the reaction is carried out with 20\u201325% excess B4C, the ZrC phase disappears, and only ZrB2 remains. Lower synthesis temperatures (~1,600\u00a0\u00b0C) produce UHTCs that exhibit finer grain sizes and better sinterability. Boron carbide must be subjected to grinding prior to the boron carbide reduction in order to promote oxide reduction and diffusion processes.\nBoron carbide reductions can also be carried out via reactive plasma spraying if a UHTC coating is desired. Precursor or powder particles react with plasma at high temperatures (6,000\u201315,000\u00a0\u00b0C) which greatly reduces the reaction time. ZrB2 and ZrO2 phases have been formed using a plasma voltage and current of 50 V and 500 A, respectively. These coating materials exhibit uniform distribution of fine particles and porous microstructures, which increased hydrogen flow rates.\nAnother method for the synthesis of UHTCs is the borothermic reduction of ZrO2, TiO2, or HfO2 with B. At temperatures higher than 1600\u00a0\u00b0C, pure diborides can be obtained from this method. Due to the loss of some boron as boron oxide, excess boron is needed during borothermic reduction. Mechanical milling can lower the reaction temperature required during borothermic reduction. This is due to the increased particle mixing and lattice defects that result from decreased particle sizes of ZnO2 and B after milling. This method is also not very useful for industrial applications due to the loss of expensive boron as boron oxide during the reaction.\nNanocrystals of group IV and V metal diborides such as TiB2, ZrB2, HfB2, NbB2, TaB2 were successfully synthesized by Zoli's Reaction, reduction of TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Nb2BO5, Ta2O5 with NaBH4 using a molar ratio M:B of 1:4 at 700\u00a0\u00b0C for 30 minutes under argon flow.\nMO2 + 3NaBH4 \u2192 MB2 + 2Na(g,l) + NaBO2 + 6H2(g) (M=Ti, Zr, Hf)\nM2O5 + 6.5NaBH4 \u2192 2MB2 + 4Na(g,l) + 2.5NaBO2+ 13H2(g) (M=Nb,Ta)\nUHTCs can be prepared from solution-based synthesis methods as well, although few substantial studies have been conducted. Solution-based methods allow for low temperature synthesis of ultrafine UHTC powders. Yan et al. have synthesized ZrB2 powders using the inorganic-organic precursors ZrOCl2\u20228H2O, boric acid and phenolic resin at 1,500\u00a0\u00b0C. The synthesized powders exhibit 200\u00a0nm crystallite size and low oxygen content (~ 1.0 wt%). UHTC preparation from polymeric precursors has also been recently investigated. ZrO2 and HfO2 can be dispersed in boron carbide polymeric precursors prior to reaction. Heating the reaction mixture to 1,500\u00a0\u00b0C results in the in situ generation of boron carbide and carbon, and the reduction of ZrO2 to ZrB2 soon follows. The polymer must be stable, processable, and contain boron and carbon in order to be useful for the reaction. Dinitrile polymers formed from the condensation of dinitrile with decaborane satisfy these criteria.\nChemical vapor deposition (CVD) of titanium and zirconium diborides is another method for preparing coatings of UHTCs. These techniques rely on metal halide and boron halide precursors (such as TiCl4 and BCl3) in the gaseous phase and use H2 as a reducing agent. This synthesis route can be employed at low temperatures and produces thin films for coating on metal (and other material) surfaces. Mojima et al. have used CVD to prepare coatings of ZrB2 on Cu at 700\u2013900\u00a0\u00b0C (Figure 2). Plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) has also been used to prepare UHTC diborides. After plasma of the reacting gases is created (by radio frequency or direct current discharge between two electrodes) the reaction takes place, followed by deposition. The deposition takes place at lower temperatures compared to traditional CVD because only the plasma needs to be heated to provide sufficient energy for the reaction. ZrB2 has been prepared via PECVD at temperatures lower than 600\u00a0\u00b0C as a coating on zircalloy. Zirconium borohydride can also be used as a precursor in PECVD. Thermal decomposition of Zr(BH)4 to ZrB2 can occur at temperatures in the range of 150\u2013400\u00a0\u00b0C in order to prepare amorphous, conductive films.\nProcessing of UHTCs and the addition of SiC.\nDiboride-based UHTCs often require high-temperature and -pressure processing to produce dense, durable materials. The high melting points and strong covalent interactions present in UHTCs make it difficult to achieve uniform densification in these materials. Densification is only achieved at temperatures above 1800\u00a0\u00b0C once grain boundary diffusion mechanisms become active. Unfortunately, processing of UHTCs at these temperatures results in materials with larger grain sizes and poor mechanical properties including reduced toughness and hardness. To achieve densification at lower temperatures, several techniques can be employed: additives such as SiC can be used in order to form a liquid phase at the sintering temperature, the surface oxide layer can be removed, or the defect concentration can be increased. SiC can react with the surface oxide layer in order to provide diboride surfaces with higher energy: adding 5\u201330 vol% SiC has demonstrated improved densification and oxidation resistance of UHTCs. SiC can be added as a powder or a polymer to diboride UHTCs. The addition of SiC as a polymer has several advantages over the more traditional addition of SiC as a powder because SiC forms along the grain boundaries when added as a polymer, which increases measures of fracture toughness (by ~24%). In addition to improved mechanical properties, less SiC needs to be added when using this method, which limits the pathways for oxygen to diffuse into the material and react. Although addition of additives such as SiC can improve densification of UHTC materials, these additives lower the maximum temperature at which UHTCs can operate due to the formation of eutectic liquids. The addition of SiC to ZrB2 lowers the operating temperature of ZrB2 from 3,245\u00a0\u00b0C to 2,270\u00a0\u00b0C.\nHot pressing is a popular method for obtaining densified UHTC materials that relies upon both high temperatures and pressures to produce densified materials. Powder compacts are heated externally and pressure is applied hydraulitically. In order to improve densification during hot pressing, diboride powders can undergo milling by attrition to obtain powders of &lt;2\u03bcm. Milling also allows for more uniform dispersion of the additive SiC. Hot pressing temperature, pressure, heating rate, reaction atmosphere, and holding times are all factors that affect the density and microstructure of UHTC pellets obtained from this method. In order to achieve &gt;99% densification from hot pressing, temperatures of 1,800\u20132,000\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures of 30 MPa or greater are required. UHTC materials with 20 vol.% SiC and toughened with 5% carbon black as additives exhibit increased densification above 1,500\u00a0\u00b0C, but these materials still require temperatures of 1,900\u00a0\u00b0C and a pressure of 30 MPa in order to obtain near theoretical densities. Other additives such as Al2O3 and Y2O3 have also been used during the hot pressing of ZrB2-SiC composites at 1800\u00a0\u00b0C. These additives react with impurities to form a transient liquid phase and promote sintering of the diboride composites. The addition of rare earth oxides such as Y2O3, Yb2O3, La2O3 and Nd2O3 can lower densification temperatures and can react with surface oxides to promote densification. Hot pressing may result in improved densities for UHTCs, but it is an expensive technique that relies on high temperatures and pressures to provide useful materials.\nPressureless sintering is another method for processing and densifying UHTCs. Pressureless sintering involves heating powdered materials in a mold in order to promote atomic diffusion and create a solid material. Compacts are prepared by uniaxial die compaction, and then the compacts are fired at chosen temperatures in a controlled atmosphere. Exaggerated grain growth that hinders densification occurs during sintering due to the low-intrinsic sinterability and the strong covalent bonds of Ti, Zr, and Hf diborides. Full densification of ZrB2 by pressureless sintering is very difficult to obtain; Chamberlain et al. have only been able to obtain ~98% densification by heating at 2,150\u00a0\u00b0C for 9 h (Figure 3). Efforts to control grain size and improve densification have focused on adding third phases to the UHTCs, some examples of these phases include the addition of boron and iridium. Addition of Ir in particular has shown an increase in the toughness of HfB2/20 vol.% SiC by 25%. Sintered density has also been shown to increase with the addition of Fe (up to 10% w/w) and Ni (up to 50% w/w) to achieve densifications of up to 88% at 1,600\u00a0\u00b0C. More advances in pressureless sintering must be made before it can be considered a viable method for UHTC processing.\nSpark plasma sintering is another method for the processing of UHTC materials. Spark plasma sintering often relies on slightly lower temperatures and significantly reduced processing times compared to hot pressing. During spark plasma sintering, a pulsed direct current passes through graphite punch rods and dies with uniaxial pressure exerted on the sample material. Grain growth is suppressed by rapid heating over the range 1,500\u20131,900\u00a0\u00b0C; this minimizes the time the material has to coarsen. Higher densities, cleaner grain boundaries, and elimination of surface impurities can all be achieved with spark plasma sintering. Spark plasma sintering also uses a pulsed current to generate an electrical discharge that cleans surface oxides off of the powder. This enhances grain boundary diffusion and migration as well as densification of the material. The UHTC composite ZrB2/20 vol%SiC can be prepared with 99% density at 2,000\u00a0\u00b0C in 5 min via spark plasma sintering. ZrB2-SiC composites have also been prepared by spark plasma sintering at 1,400\u00a0\u00b0C over a period of 9 min. Spark plasma sintering has proven to be a useful technique for the synthesis of UHTCs, especially for preparation of UHTCs with smaller grain sizes.\nApplications.\nUHTCs, specifically Hf and Zr based diboride, are being developed to handle the forces and temperatures experienced by leading vehicle edges in atmospheric reentry and sustained hypersonic flight. The surfaces of hypersonic vehicles experience extreme temperatures in excess of 2,500\u00a0\u00b0C while also being exposed to high-temperature, high-flow-rate oxidizing plasma. The material design challenges associated with developing such surfaces have so far limited the design of orbital re-entry bodies and hypersonic air-breathing vehicles such as scramjets and DARPA's HTV because the bow shock in front of a blunt body protects the underlying surface from the full thermal force of the onrushing plasma with a thick layer of relatively dense and cool plasma.\nSharp edges dramatically reduce drag, but the current generation of thermal protection system materials are unable to withstand the considerably higher forces and temperatures experienced by sharp leading edges in reentry conditions. The relation between radius of curvature and temperature in a leading edge is inversely proportional, i.e. as radius decreases temperature increases during hypersonic flight. Vehicles with \"sharp\" leading edges have significantly higher lift to drag ratios, enhancing the fuel efficiency of sustained flight vehicles such as DARPA's HTV-3 and the landing cross-range and operational flexibility of reusable orbital spaceplane concepts being developed such as the Reaction Engines Skylon and Boeing X-33.\nZirconium diboride is used in many boiling water reactor fuel assemblies due to its refractory nature, corrosion resistance, high-neutron-absorption cross-section of 759 barns, and stoichiometric boron content. Boron acts as a \"burnable\" neutron absorber because its two isotopes, 10B and 11B, both transmute into stable nuclear reaction products upon neutron absorption (4He + 7Li and 12C, respectively) and therefore act as sacrificial materials which protect other components which become more radioactive with exposure to thermal neutrons. However, the boron in ZrB2|ZrB2 must be enriched in 11B because the gaseous helium evolved by 10B strains the fuel pellet of UO2 creates a gap between coating and fuel, and increases the fuel's centerline temperature; such cladding materials have been used on the uranium oxide fuel pellets in Westinghouse AP-1000 nuclear reactors. The high thermal neutron absorbance of boron also has the secondary effect of biasing the neutron spectrum to higher energies, so the fuel pellet retains more radioactive 239Pu at the end of a fuel cycle. In addition to this deleterious effect of integrating a neutron absorber on the surface of a fuel pellet, boron coatings have the effect of creating a power density bulge in the middle of a nuclear reactor fuel cycle through the superposition of 235U depletion and faster burning of 11B. To help level out this bulge, ZrB2/Gd cermets are being studied which would extend fuel lifetime by superimposing three simultaneous degradation curves.\nDue to the combination of refractory properties, high thermal conductivity, and the advantages of large stoichiometric boron content outlined in the above discussion of integral neutron absorbing fuel pellet cladding, refractory diborides have been used as control rod materials and have been studied for use in space nuclear power applications. While boron carbide is the most popular material for fast breeder reactors due to its lack of expense, extreme hardness comparable to diamond, and high cross-section, it completely disintegrates after a 5% burnup and is reactive when in contact with refractory metals. Hafnium diboride also suffers from high susceptibility to material degradation with boron transmutation, but its high melting point of 3,380\u00a0\u00b0C and the large thermal neutron capture cross section of hafnium of 113 barns and low reactivity with refractory metals such as tungsten makes it an attractive control rod material when clad with a refractory metal.\nTitanium diboride is a popular material for handling molten aluminum due to its electrical conductivity, refractory properties, and its ability to wet with molten aluminum providing a superior electrical interface while not contaminating the aluminum with boron or titanium. TiB2 has been used as a drained cathode in the electroreduction of molten Al(III). In drained-cathode processes, aluminum can be produced with an electrode gap of only 0.25 m with an accompanying reduction in required voltage. However, implementation of such technology still faces hurdles: with a reduction in voltage, there is a concomitant reduction in heat generation and better insulation at the top of the reactor is required. In addition to improved insulation, the technology requires better bonding methods between TiB2 and the bulk graphite electrode substrate. Bonding tiles of TiB2 or applying composite coatings each present their own unique challenges, with the high cost and large TiB2 capital cost of the former and the design difficulty of the latter. Composite materials must have each component degrade at the same rate, or the wettability and thermal conductivity of the surface will be lost with active material still remaining deeper within the electrode plate.\nZrB2/60%SiC composites have been used as novel conducting ceramic heaters which display high oxidation resistance and melting points, and do not display the negative temperature coefficient resistance property of pure silicon carbide. The metal-like conductance of ZrB2 allows for its conductivity to decrease with increasing temperature, preventing uncontrollable electrical discharge while maintaining high operational upper bounds for operation. It was also found that through incorporation of 40% ZrB2 flexural strength was reduced from 500 MPa and 359 MPa in SiC and ZrB2 single crystals to 212.96 MPa, with flexural strength highly correlated to the size of grains in the annealed ceramic material. Conductivity at 500\u00a0\u00b0C was found to be 0.005 \u03a9 cm for the 40% SiC composite, versus 0.16 \u03a9 cm in pure SiC.", "matches": ["high temperature"], "label": []}

The United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany and western parts of Russia were most affected. \nSeveral records were broken. In the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, July 2006 was the warmest month since official measurements began.\nCountry-by-country.\nBelgium.\nBelgium experienced two heat waves in July 2006. Before 1990, a heat wave occurred about once every 8 years. Currently, the country averages one heat wave per year. On 19 July 2006, temperatures throughout the entire country rose to , causing it, at that moment, to be the hottest July day since 1947. The highest temperatures were recorded at the stations of Kleine Brogel and Genk, which measured and , respectively.\nIn some regions, more particularly Limburg, 36 consecutive days of temperatures above have been measured in one continuous local heat wave instead of two separate periods of hot weather (according to the official Belgian rules for registering a heat wave). In most other parts of the country, the second heat wave lasted for 17\u00a0days.\nJuly 2006 became the warmest month in Belgian history, with an all-time high mean temperature of .\nUnited Kingdom.\nAt 14:32 BST on Wednesday, 19 July 2006, was recorded at Wisley, Surrey. This confirmed that the period of prolonged warm weather was a true heat wave. The United Kingdom's all-time temperature high of attained at Faversham, Kent, on 10 August 2003 was not reached. \nWhilst a disputed was recorded at Wisley Airfield on 18 July, this figure has never been accepted and the figure of from 19 July is the highest acceptable value. This figure is generally deemed to be erroneous and it has been suggested that the recorded temperature was in fact . Another theory is that the record on 18 July 2006 was recorded in the sunshine, not in standard 'shaded' areas. \nSimilar temperatures were recorded in the sunshine during a brief heatwave at Wimbledon on 1 July 2015. The heatwave even warmed the normally cool and wet Scottish summer, with Glasgow having a July high of and low of , which made it the warmest month on record. Because of the northerly location and marine nature, it was not a heat wave in a general sense, but rather unusually warm weather.\nHowever, in 2022, even hotter temperatures were met across the whole of the United Kingdom, with a record high of 40.3\u00b0C in Coningsby, Lincolnshire, which is the first officially acceptable temperature above 40\u00b0C in the UK \nDrought was an issue in many parts of the United Kingdom after a very dry winter. There was warning of drought occurring from the early months of 2006. Following the dry winter, with extreme temperatures occurring in the country and little rain, increasing strain was put on water supplies, and hose-pipe bans were issued in many counties. The Environment Agency claimed that the UK may have had the most severe drought in 100 years.\nSome power cuts occurred, after lightning strikes and some due to large amounts of electricity used by air conditioners. In Central London on 27 July 2006 a series of power cuts hit Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street, Turner Broadcasting UK and Oxford Circus causing the closure of shops and businesses, when pre-existing faults were worsened by heavy demand.\nThe Met Office confirmed that July 2006 was the warmest July, as well as the warmest single month, overall, across the UK, and a number of regional records were also broken.\nThe tarmac on some roads melted in England, requiring application of crushed rock dust.\nGermany.\nIn Germany most of the July temperature average records were broken. In Mannheim/Ludwigshafen a July average of was recorded, which means a temperature anomaly of , which is a new record for a monthly average in Germany (in the same cities high temperatures reached over ). In Berlin an average temperature of was recorded ( above normal). Such numbers were recorded all over Germany. The biggest problem was the precipitation, which mostly fell in intense thunderstorms. At least 20\u00a0people died in this heatwave.\nDenmark.\nDenmark experienced the warmest July ever with an average temperature (day and night) of , breaking a record of set in 1994. It was the second-warmest month ever, behind August 1997 at . It was also the sunniest July ever, and the second-sunniest ever, at 321\u00a0hours. In fact, the previous July record was 290\u00a0hours. Since Denmark escaped the extremes seen further south, it is now known as one of the best summer months in history.\nOn 6 July, the temperature reached 36.0\u00b0C in Odense.\nFrance.\nHigh temperatures in France destroyed many crops, just days before the harvest period, while French officials said at least 40\u00a0people were confirmed to have been killed by the heat wave directly. Temperatures as high as were recorded in Paris during the heatwave. July 2006 was in many regions the warmest July ever recorded (and often the second warmest month after August 2003). In many regions weather was particularly stormy. In Nice, the all-time high temperature record was beaten with a recorded on 1 August.\nIreland.\nIreland was affected from the heat wave from the start of June, and the warm weather continued until the end of July.\nTemperatures were well above average for both months. The highest recorded in June was at Ardfert, County Kerry on 9 June. In Kilkenny, County Kilkenny, there were 29 consecutive days in July with temperatures over , and nine of these days had temperatures over . July 2006 was the warmest July in Ireland since records began. By the end of July, temperatures returned to average figures.\nOn 18 July, a temperature of was recorded in Birr, County Offaly; the same day, was recorded at Kilkenny Castle, County Kilkenny and Shannon Airport, County Clare. However, temperatures again rose to at Casement Aerodrome, Dublin; and at Elphin, County Roscommon on the 19 July \u2013 this is the warmest temperature recorded in Ireland since 1976. Temperatures over are rare in Ireland, being recorded about once or twice every decade \u2013 1976, 1983, 1989, 1995, 2003 and now 2006 are the most recent times of such high temperatures. The highest ever recorded in Ireland was at Kilkenny Castle, County Kilkenny on 26 June 1887.\nThe highest mean temperatures during the heatwave were recorded at Merrion Square in Dublin city centre both months \u2013 in June (average ) and in July (average ).\nTo put this into context, average daily maxima in Ireland in only vary from in June; and in July.\nDespite the high daytime temperatures, night time temperatures were sometimes below average ( in June; in July). Grass temperatures as low as were recorded at Birr, County Offaly on 23 June; however, the lowest air temperature recorded was at Straide, County Mayo on 14 June. The cool night time temperatures are thought to have made the heat wave more bearable there.\nSunshine levels were very high all over the country, with 257\u00a0hours (~8.6\u00a0hours a day) of sunshine recorded at Cork Airport, County Cork in June (making it the sunniest June since records began) and 283\u00a0hours (~9.1\u00a0hours a day) of sunshine at Rosslare, County Wexford in July (sunniest July since 1990). The sunniest day during the two months (and indeed, the year) was on 25 June, when Malin Head, County Donegal, recorded 15.8\u00a0hours of sunshine.\nRainfall levels were quite low, with only of rain at Derrygreenagh, County Offaly and Fermoy, County Cork in June and of rain recorded at Merrion Square, Dublin in July. Parts of Munster and Leinster also recorded 21\u00a0days between 28 May and 17 June where no rainfall was recorded. There was also a period between 9 July and 27 July when no rainfall was recorded in Greater Dublin. Despite the low rainfall, drought was not an issue in Ireland.\nIn Ireland, May 2006 was the warmest for 20 years and sunniest since 2000. June 2006 was the sunniest on record, driest since 1995 and also one of the warmest. July 2006 was the warmest on record, sunniest in 15 years and also driest since 1989. August 2006 was average. \nSeptember 2006 was the warmest on record. October 2006 was the warmest in many places since 2001 and sunniest since 2000. November 2006 was warmer and sunnier than usual. Overall, Summer 2006 (June, July and August) was the sunniest, driest and warmest summer since 1995 and one of the sunniest, driest and warmest on record. Autumn 2006 (September, October, November) was the warmest on record in many places, and sunshine levels were well above normal. Rainfall levels were also above average.\nThe months of June and July 2006 are regarded as one of the best summers ever due to the high levels of sunshine, warm temperatures and low rainfall. Drought and health problems were not an issue in Ireland, unlike many parts of Europe \u2013 mostly because the heat was not as severe there.\nNetherlands.\nJuly 2006\nWith a monthly average of , KNMI statistics show July 2006 was the warmest-ever month on record for the Netherlands.KNMI Klimaatdata en Advies - Informatie over verleden weer Around 500 or 1,000 more people than usual died in July 2006.CBS - 500 extra doden in warme juliweken - Webmagazine\nThe Four Day Marches of Nijmegen were cancelled after only one day as hundreds of people collapsed the first day, two of them eventually dying due to fatal heat stroke. The walking people had to walk on open roads without any shade and there was not enough water for everyone. Paramedics had their hands full with hundreds of people who fainted due to the heat. The walking people had to deal with temperatures in the sun of . The air-temperatures on the first day of the four-day march was about . Forecasts showed even higher temperatures of for the next day, causing the organisation to cancel the remainder of the event. Vierdaagse\nThe highest temperature was recorded on 19 July, when temperatures reached the mid- to upper 30s\u00a0\u00b0C (mid- to upper 90s\u00a0\u00b0F) for most of the country, especially in the south-east. The all-time record for the month of July was broken. Temperatures soared to . A few hundred meters across the border into Germany, at the weather station Kalkar, located at the airport in Weeze, near Nijmegen, a maximum of was recorded on 19 July.\nAt some places especially in the south-east of the Netherlands temperatures passed for 15 or 16\u00a0days. The average daytime temperature for the month was again in the south-east of the Netherlands. The lowest daytime temperature was at some locations for the whole month of July. For two days the daytime temperatures were below , making 29\u00a0days with temperatures of and higher.\nDuring days when temperatures reached or higher, and on days without wind, the smog level was very high. Warnings were broadcast on television and radio, advising people to stay indoors as much as possible because the air pollution was very unhealthy, the smog was very strong and it was dangerously hot.\nThe Netherlands also had to deal with extreme drought in June and July. The rainfall in June was at some locations as low as , July was also extremely dry. Because of the extreme heat and drought vegetation was very dry, and the humidity levels were very low, causing brushfires.\nOn 30 January 2007, the United Nations published a report of all countries in the world with the most deaths related to natural disasters for 2006. The Netherlands appeared fourth place, with 1,000 heat-related deaths.\nOn 19 July, the temperature reached 37.1\u00b0C in Westdorpe.\nPoland.\nJuly 2006 was the warmest in Poland since the beginning of the meteorological measurements (i.e. 1779). For most of the month, the maximum temperature exceeded \u2013 even at night it rarely fell below . The average temperature was more than higher than normal, for example in Warsaw the average temperature in July 2006 is usually , in Wroc\u0142aw , and in Pozna\u0144 . The highest temperature was recorded in S\u0142ubice, near the German border . After the hot days, the temperature at night dropped very slowly. On 16 July in S\u0142ubice the temperature at night was and it was the warmest night in the entire history of meteorological measurements.\nJuly 2006 was also extremely dry. In many regions it did not rain for 3\u20134 weeks. The river water levels were the lowest ever reported in Polish history and in the absence of rain, many crops dried up.\nJuly 2006 in most Polish cities saw 300\u2013350 sunshine hours (normally 220\u2013240 sunshine hours): the highest number being in Pozna\u0144 (373 sunshine hours) and in Warsaw (355 sunshine hours).\nPost 2006:\nJuly 2007 was AGAIN normal month in Poland. Temperature rarely exceed and it was warm, wet and wild. In many regions, including Elblag rained and it was stormy. Many crops returned to normal business, temperature rarely at night exceed and it was Cloudy, and sunny.\nSweden.\nAccording to the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI), the city of Lund in Sk\u00e5ne in southern Sweden had the highest average temperatures (day and night: ) for the month of July since records began in 1859. The rest of Sweden has however not broken the daily average temperatures from the record year 1994.\nThe highest temperature in Sweden in July 2006 was recorded in M\u00e5lilla in Sm\u00e5land, where a temperature of was recorded on 6 July. This is the highest temperature recorded in the country since July 1994 when Kalmar and S\u00f6derhamn had .\nM\u00e5lilla and Ultuna are the places where the highest temperature ever in Sweden was recorded, , in 1947 and 1933 respectively.\nM\u00e5lilla was the warmest location during daytime, averaging , but with average lows being normal at fell a whole degree short of Lund's aforementioned value, where the average high was and low . The summer was warmer than usual in all of Sweden, but north of Stockholm and the M\u00e4lar valley the temperatures fell quickly, with the exception of the usual hotspot of Falun where the average high was in spite of its location a bit north of 60 degrees latitude.\nRussia.\nAbsolute maxima of July 2006 have been broken in\nThe warmest July in\nPeriod after the heat wave.\nDue to the extreme heat in July 2006, the ocean water reached a temperature normally reached in September. This increase in water temperature led to faster evaporation of ocean waters, making August one of the cloudiest and wettest months in recorded history in various western European countries. Many weather experts report this to be a direct consequence of the heat wave, as the high evaporation rate caused the atmosphere to generate many low pressure areas.\nDespite this, September 2006 was again the warmest September on record, in the UK and elsewhere, due to high ocean temperatures, altered atmospheric pressure zones, and consequent different wind directions over Europe. The pressure zone changes were a consequence of the extra-tropical remnants of Atlantic hurricanes settling over the British Isles.\nThe Met Office announced on 16 October 2006 that the extended summer of May to September 2006 was the hottest summer ever recorded, the Central England temperature mean temperature of for this summer was warmer than the average temperatures of 1961\u20131990. \nIn the Netherlands.\nJust two months after July 2006, September 2006 became the warmest September since official measurements started. Additionally, October 2006 and November 2006 broke several temperature records. October was one of the warmest Octobers since measurements began, and November went into the record books as the second warmest November since official measurements started three hundred years prior. With temperatures from the north of the Netherlands to the south of Belgium ranging between at the end of November, previous records were shattered. The autumn of 2006 was the warmest autumn in history, breaking the old record of just one year prior (2005) by . The winter of 2006/2007 was the warmest in three hundred years as well, and so was the following spring.\nWith the exception of August 2006, every month from April 2006 to June 2007 saw temperatures above average, the most bizarre months being January 2007, which noted an average temperature of rather than , and April 2007, with as opposed to . Temperatures reached a record-breaking as early as 15 April. The average April daytime maximum in the Netherlands is around .\nSuch a sequence of events is unheard of in the Netherlands meteorological history, estimated to happen every 8,000 years when not taking global warming into account. It's been a result of a unique mixture of the hot summer increasing marine temperatures and Northern Atlantic hurricanes settling as depressions off the coast of Scotland, giving the European continent a constant stream of southern, fast winds rendering it unable to cool down from the Mediterranean through to northern Europe.\nIn Belgium.\nAfter the record-breaking month of July, August broke records on the opposite end. August 2006 was extremely rainy. Some places registered more than of rain and received a total sunshine amount of only 90 hours, which is less than half the expected sunshine for a typical August month and a record low for any summer month in Uccle. The average temperature was about . \nSeptember 2006 has been the warmest autumn month in Belgian history, with an average temperature of , while the normal temperature is (1971-2000 normals), exceptionally preceding a much colder August month. October 2006 has been the second warmest in history with an average temperature of (normal average for 1971-2000: ). November 2006 has been the 4th warmest month in history, with an average temperature of (normal average for 1971-2000: ). December 2006 continued the warm trend.\nThe autumn of 2006, at that moment, had been the warmest autumn season in recorded history with an average temperature of , which was above the normal average for the climatological period 1971-2000. As of 2021, this record still stands firmly.\n2007 has broken many records as well. January 2007 broke every temperature record (minimum, maximum and average). The average temperature was , while the normal was just . February 2007 set some daily records and was 2\u00a0\u00b0C warmer than normal.\nThe winter of 2007, just like the previous autumn season, has also been the warmest in recorded history.\nMarch 2007 was the 6th warmest month in history, just 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C less than the record at that time. April 2007 broke the all-time temperature records once again, as the average temperature had been 5\u00a0\u00b0C warmer than normal. Kleine Brogel had two tropical days on 15 and 16 April 2007 ( and ), which have been the earliest dates any place in Belgium had ever seen temperatures at or over 30\u00b0C. May started warmer than normal, but a 9-month warmth streak eventually came to an end when June returned to average temperatures around normal.\nIn Finland.\nThe summer of 2006 was around 2\u00a0\u00b0C warmer than the 1971\u20132000 average. While the heat was not record breaking, the drought was: less than half of the average summer rainfall was received in large areas, and almost all of the country received less than 75% of the usual rain. In many localities (such as Jokioinen, Kajaani and Rovaniemi, it was the driest summer on record. Autumn 2006 was also warmer than the average. While this didn't break any records, an unprecedented period of mild weather began around the middle of November.\nDecember 2006 was the warmest December ever recorded in Finland. In Helsinki, the December mean temperature was , beating the previous record of set in 1929. Similar records were broken across the southern and central parts of the country, while in the north the old records narrowly remained in place. On 6 December, an all time December high of was recorded at Salo.\nThe mild weather continued well into January 2007. On January 10, many places in southern Finland observed record highs for January. These included Helsinki-Vantaa at , Turku at , and Lappeenranta at . (The national record high for January, set at Mariehamn in 1973, remained in place.) As a whole, the two months leading to 16 January were the mildest such period ever recorded in Finland. In Helsinki, the mean temperature for this period was , beating the previous record of set in 1982\u201383. In Sodankyl\u00e4, it was (previous record set in 1972/73). In the second half of January, temperatures plunged and February 2007 was well below the average over 1971 to 2000.\nIn France.\nAfter the unusually hot July, August brought a big contrast with cool weather, cloudy skies and pretty wet weather patterns all around the country, with the exception of the Mediterranean coast.\nSeptember however turned to be very warm and sunny and in many parts of France it was the warmest in 50 years. October too was very warm and so was November, triggering in many regions the warmest autumn in recorded history. A very rare f\u00f6hn-like warm spell affected northern and western France on 25 November and brought temperature as high as at 7 in the morning in Paris.\nDecember, January and February also brought extremely mild weather making the winter of 2006/2007 the warmest in recorded history.\nMarch was relatively uneventful with average temperatures and precipitations. However April broke the record for the warmest April on record. In many regions it was also the sunniest (with almost uninterrupted sunshine for the whole 30\u00a0days) and the driest April on record. In northern and north-eastern France the departure from the normal of the average temperature was as high as 5\u00a0\u00b0C (9\u00a0\u00b0F). May was too very warm making the spring 2007 the warmest in recorded history for some regions.\nIn the United Kingdom.\nLike the rest of Western Europe, August 2006 saw a dramatic turnaround, being a cloudy and wet month in many parts with daytime maxima below average \u2013 although the Central England Temperature (CET) was close to the long-term average, due to the cloud keeping night minima higher than normal. The month was notable for its lack of heat waves, being the first August since 1993 when ) was not recorded anywhere in the country. However, August 2008, which followed a much cooler July, was even duller and wetter. August 2010 again followed a similar pattern.\nSeptember 2006 was just as record-breaking as July, being the warmest on record and just as exceptionally, warmer than August had been. October and November, although not beating the records for the warmest set in 2001 and 1994 respectively, were also much warmer than average.\nWinter 2006/07 was exceptionally mild, the warmest since 1868/69.\nApril 2007 was another record-breaker, with a CET of the warmest in over 300 years of temperature records and by a large margin (10.6c being previous record) remarkably this was smashed just 4 years later in 2011 with a CET of ! Temperatures were widely above , with over 200 hours of sunshine for much of the country. Parts of south-eastern Britain had no rain all month.\nIn Poland.\nAfter a hot and dry July, August 2006 was cold and very rainy. The average temperature hovered slightly below the long-term standards. At the beginning of the month in the west of the country experienced torrential rains and violent storms. In Wroc\u0142aw decreased of water; that is 4 times more than usual. As a result of heavy rains came the floods, which affected mainly Lower Silesia.\nFor a change September 2006 was warm and dry. In the west, that month was more than warmer than the norm. In S\u0142ubice the average temperature was until . Early September brought gusty winds in Poland, near Bydgoszcz in Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship tornado passed, which escaped with the roots of several hundred trees.\nOctober 2006 is also inscribed as one of the warmer in the history of meteorological measurements, as well as very dry. For many days the temperature exceeded degrees, reaching up to at the south of the country. It was also very sunny month, because reported about 150 sunshine hours.\nNovember 2006 in Poland was the warmest from 10 years. The daily temperature reached up to and at night rarely dropped below . November was very wet, usually dropped of water, and the standard is approximately . Like in October the wind was blowing strongly, particularly on the coast of the Baltic Sea. At the end of the month, thick fog blocked airports in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and Wroc\u0142aw to 3 days.\nWinter 2006/2007 was extremely warm and rainy, in many cities, the snow lay only a few days, and rain fell for MANY days. At night the temperature increased up to degrees, which at this time of year, it was an unprecedented phenomenon. In January 2007, the maximum temperature increased to , especially in the south, where often blow halny \u2013 a foehn wind, and in Elblag during the day , and at night . The average temperature in winter 2006/2007 in eastern Poland was about , normally and in western Poland , normally . \nThis conclusion was the warmest winter since the measurements. In March 2007, in Elblag this month was snow-less, but it rained and the temperature reached up to , and at night of 22nd of March . Summer 2007 was not that dry. It rained a lot, temperatures reached down to in the Polish-Czech/Tatra hills, temps reached up to , but it lasted for only 2-3 days, and temperature fell down.\nIn Russia.\nDecember 2006 and January 2007 were the warmest months in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kazan and other cities of European Russia.\nMarch 2007 was the warmest month in Moscow (+) with a record maximum +\nIn May 2007 the absolute maximum of month in many cities has been established:\n2007 and 2008 became the warmest years in Moscow history with average year temperatures + (2nd) and + (1st).", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

At least three died in Philadelphia, Arkansas, and Indiana. In Maryland, the state health officials reported that three people died of heat-related causes. Another heat related death was suspected in Chicago.\nAlthough many heat related deaths go unreported, by July 19, the Associated Press reported that the soaring heat was blamed for 12 deaths from Oklahoma City to the Philadelphia area. Reports by early morning July 20 raised the death toll to at least 16 in seven states.\nThis period of heat also saw a wind storm (derecho) in St. Louis that caused widespread power outages, including for cooling centers designed to provide relief for those suffering from the heat. In addition, places on the West Coast, like California's Central Valley and Southern California experienced humid heat, which is unusual for the area.\nMortality.\nBy July 21, when the first phase of this heat wave came to an end, 22 reported fatalities had occurred in ten states. Reports of deaths trailed off over the week-end of July 21\u201323, though high temperatures persisted and power outages remained in a number of areas including New York, Missouri, and Illinois. In St. Louis, half the city was without power due to severe thunderstorms, prompting requests for volunteer nurses to help cope with the situation. Though temperatures were somewhat cooler, there still was at least one further reported heat death in Missouri.\nAt least 31 deaths due to the heat were reported in New York City by August 16. At least 13 died in Queens, 9 in Brooklyn, 5 in Manhattan and 1 in The Bronx. By the end of August, authorities totaled 40 deaths in New York, however a later mortality review in November 2006 revealed that heat was a factor in 140 deaths.\nIn the early August heat, Chicago saw at least 23 deaths, but the City was widely praised for avoiding the disaster that occurred in the 1995 Chicago heat wave which saw over 700 deaths. The City took steps to ensure vulnerable residents were protected, and individuals took responsibility for their neighbors.\nBy August 13, 28 heat-related deaths were reported in Cook County, which includes Chicago. \nDeaths in California.\nThe most severe death toll was in California, principally in the interior region. By the end of July, the sweltering heat in California subsided, although the number of confirmed or suspected heat-related deaths climbed to 163 as county coroners worked through a backlog of cases. A report from California Climate Change Center published in 2009 determined that the heat caused two to three times the number of deaths estimated by coroners in seven California counties.\nBy July 25, California authorities documented at least 38 deaths related to the heat in 11 counties. Temperatures reached in the central valley of California July 23\u201324. State officials said it was the worst heat wave to hit Northern and Southern California simultaneously in 57 years. Front-page newspaper coverage described some individual deaths. By July 29, the mounting death toll left the coroner's office in Fresno overwhelmed and double-stacking bodies.\nThere were also widespread animal deaths in California, with a veterinarian reporting 15 heat-related pet deaths as early as July 24. The impact on farm animals and agriculture was also becoming apparent, with the death of more than 25,000 cattle and 700,000 fowl, prompting emergency measures by the state.\nMeteorology.\nTemperatures hit on July 21 in Phoenix, making it the hottest day since 1995 and one of the 11 hottest since 1895, when temperature records were first kept in the city. California temperatures began reaching record levels by July 22. In one section of the City of Los Angeles, Woodland Hills, the temperature reached making it the highest recorded temperature in the county and within the city border breaking the old record of in Canoga Park. The unusual daytime heat resulted in extremely high overnight temperatures. Needles, California recorded a low temperature for Sunday, July 23 at 5 am., of and in the LA basin the same night, Burbank recorded an overnight low of .\nThe California heat wave broke local records. According to some reports it was \"hotter for longer than ever before, and the weather patterns that caused the scorching temperatures were positively freakish.\" Fresno, in the central California valley, had six consecutive days of 110\u00a0degree-plus Fahrenheit temperatures.\nBeginning July 31 and into early August, the Midwest, Ontario, and Atlantic states also began experiencing the heat. Temperatures approached the 100 mark in Rochester, New York on August 1 and were coupled with the highest dew points the area has experienced in over 51 years. The heat index reached that day. La Guardia Airport in New York City recorded three consecutive days above . The temperature peaked at on August 2. Colonial Downs, a horse track in New Kent County, Virginia, canceled horse racing because of the heat. The Saratoga Race Course, north of Albany, canceled racing at the horse track for the first time in its history on August 2. By August 8, the heat wave had passed for most areas, but persisted in the South and Southeast, with continued reports of mortality in Oklahoma.\nTimeline.\nThe heat wave went through several distinct periods:\nReported physical damage.\nDallas, Texas; Shreveport, Louisiana; the New England region; and other areas have reported damage such as ruptured water lines and buckled roads. The heat wave has been blamed for the damage. Interstate 44 had two traffic lanes temporarily closed in Oklahoma City after they buckled under the heat. In addition, overworked power transformers have been damaged or rendered useless because of the heat, resulting in blackouts, notably in St. Louis, Missouri; Queens, New York; Los Angeles, California; and the Delaware Valley. Some wildfires, including forest fires, and greater thunderstorm intensity, have both been blamed on the heat wave.\nCanadian heat.\nParts of Canada, mostly areas of provinces located close to the U.S. border (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec) had been affected in waves by the persistent heat over the continent building from west to east during the month of July, which progressed into August 2006. Persistent heat and drought had plagued some of the same regions of the country during the previous summers of 2002, 2003, and 2005, although large, frequent storms brought above normal rainfall to many areas in Ontario and Quebec during those years.\nBy mid-month, temperatures had soared to at Lytton, British Columbia, with three straight days topping . Although various daily records were broken, the only overall monthly record in a major city was in Winnipeg, Manitoba where July was not only the driest on record but also had the highest average maximum temperature of any July. In Val Marie, Saskatchewan, the average daily maximum July temperature was , about higher than average.\nJust north of Toronto at Buttonville Airport, the temperature reached on August 2, 2006. On the same day, the nighttime minimum temperature in Toronto was the highest ever recorded, only dropping to . In Ottawa, the temperature reached , but with close to 80% humidity factored in, it reached an all-time humidex record of .\nRecord power consumption was recorded in Ontario when close to 27,000 MW were used by consumers, beating out a record from the previous summer.\nPowerful thunderstorms affected parts of Ontario and Quebec on July 17 and July 30 in Peterborough, in eastern Ontario (Ottawa area) in the early morning hours of August 1 and again in Quebec, centred around Montreal that same evening. More than 450,000\u00a0people lost power in Quebec in that storm. On August 2, more storms associated with a relieving cool front caused heavy damage over a wide swath of central and eastern Ontario, resulting in 175,000 residents losing power and thousands of felled trees blocking roads. Seventeen tornadoes were confirmed for August 2\u20133 ranging from F0-F2 in strength, the largest single day tornado outbreak in Ontario eclipsing the 14 recorded during a 1985 outbreak. The intensity of these storms was fueled by the heat bubble to the south. These series of storms killed at least four people and injured many others, in addition to extensive property damage and forest destruction.\nAfter early August 2006, the heat only had a sporadic impact through the remainder of the month, mostly in the West. Temperatures returned to normal or even below average in other parts of the country for the remainder of the summer.\nImpact of heat waves.\nAlthough comparatively little reporting is made about the health effects of extraordinarily hot conditions, heat waves are responsible for more deaths annually than more energetic natural disasters such as lightning, rain, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Supporting this conclusion, Karl Swanberg, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, reported that between 1936 and 1975, about 20,000 U.S. residents died of heat. \"Heat and solar radiation on average kill more U.S. residents each year than lightning, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods or earthquakes,\" said Karl Swanberg. This finding is also referenced in a publication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, giving guidance on how to avoid health problems due to heat.", "matches": ["heat wave"], "label": []}

The heat wave may have been the hottest summer in Continental Europe between the summers of 1540 and 2003. July 1757 was the hottest month in the history of Paris with an average temperature of (compared to 24.8\u00a0\u00b0C during the 2006 European heat wave), and it reached a high of on 14 July. Similarly, over Central England, July 1757 was the hottest month on record since 1659, at the time, and would not be beaten until July 1783. It still the ninth-warmest on record in that series.\nAccounts.\nThere were contemporaneous accounts of the heat wave noting its effects. Physician John Huxham wrote \"An Account of the Extraordinary Heat of the Weather in July 1757, and the Effects of It\", which appeared in the \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" in 1758. Huxham reports on the effects in England, writing that it caused \"haemorrhages from several parts of the body\", including the nose, and the uterus in women. Among other maladies, Huxham described \"sudden and violent pains of the head, and vertigo, profuse sweats, great debility and oppression of the spirits, affected many. There were putrid fevers in great abundance.\" Symptoms consistent with dehydration described by Huxham included that \"the urine was commonly high colored, and in small quantity.\"\nHorace Walpole wrote a letter on 12 July 1757 noting \"the heat of this magnificent weather, with the glass up to three-quarters of sultry.\" He also commented that on walking his garden, \"I thought I should have died of it\" and exclaimed: \"For how many years we shall have to talk of the summer of fifty-seven!\" Four days later he remarked in another letter that \"the weather has been so hot, and we are so unused to it, that nobody knew how to behave themselves. Even Mr. Bentley has done shivering.\"\nOther reports include a letter from Brussels which appeared in the \"London Chronicle\", claiming that the temperature on 14 July reached \"a Degree of Heat which hath not been felt in this Country for many years,\" and a report from Dublin calling it the warmest summer in Ireland in the past 35 years.\nQuaker poet John Scott of Amwell wrote of the heat wave in his 1760 \"Four Elegies: Descriptive and Moral,\", with Elegy II \"written in the hot weather, July, 1757.\" It included stanzas such as \"Lost is the lively Aspect of the Ground; Low are the Springs, the reedy Ditches dry; No verdant Spot in all the Vale is found; Save what yon Stream's unfailing Stores supply.\"\nWhether or not Walpole was correct that the 1757 heat wave would be long discussed, it has not been the subject of much subsequent discussion or writing, aside from occasional reprints of accounts such as Huxham's. When the 2003 European heat occurred, the earlier event was noted in the press as holding the prior record.", "matches": ["heatwave"], "label": []}
